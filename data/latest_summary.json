In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it.

Advertisment On April 28, 2025, the Spanish and Portuguese electricity grids collapsed, causing a total voltage outage and disconnecting the region from the continental European grid. **The Incident** At the time, Spain and Portugal were experiencing low demand alongside very high renewable penetration—82% in Spain and 91% in Portugal. According to Powergrid’s report, around 7,400 MW of gas and 3,000 MW of nuclear capacity went offline, taking the total outage to 12,800 MW. Advertisment **Factors Behind Grid Instability** Minutes of a meeting chaired by the Secretary (Power) on August 27, 2025, revealed that insufficient reactive power and voltage control, poor damping of oscillations, and cascade tripping due to overvoltage were the root causes of the blackout. Reactive power support refers to the management and provision of reactive power to ensure the grid operates reliably and efficiently.

So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics.

The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has publicly attributed the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge.

Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two..."

The move comes as the nation rapidly scales up its renewable energy capacity, which is projected to exceed 500 gigawatts (GW) before 2030, introducing unprecedented levels of variability and complexity into the grid. > India to Honour Top CISOs from Police, Law Enforcement, and Defence Forces This new phase will utilize AI to process real-time streaming data at a 40-millisecond resolution, a dramatic leap from the current reactive operational philosophy.

[] Tensions are rising among India, Pakistan and China amid rumors of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops entering Kashmir through Gilgit-Baltistan region. Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. Article Search * * * !

Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims.

On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry...

Chinese President Xi Jinping was set to arrive in India on Oct. 11 for an informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mamallapuram. Xi hosted Modi last year after bilateral ties deteriorated during the 2017 Doklam standoff, in which thousands of Indian and Chinese troops nearly came to blows. For Xi, a preoccupation with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war as part of Beijing's broader strategic competition with Washington explains why he wants calm with neighbors like New Delhi. And for Modi, a desire to avoid confrontation with China -- the superior military and economic power -- explains why he wishes to sustain high-level dialogue with Xi. Ultimately, however, any dialogue will strive purely to manage tensions, which will only grow in the long run..."
