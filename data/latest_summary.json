Cyclones in India Causes and Geography India’s long coastline, spanning over 7,500 kilometers, makes it vulnerable to cyclones, particularly along the eastern coast in the Bay of Bengal. India’s eastern coastline and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are particularly vulnerable to tsunamis due to their proximity to tectonic plate boundaries.

Represented by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Asian Center for Human Rights, and think tanks such as the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, this camp takes a far more holistic attitude toward the most desirable means of combating Naxal violence.13 Stressing the need for poverty reduction, land reform, and better local governance, adherents to this line of reasoning reject government sponsored violence as a solution to the Naxalite problem except in the most extreme circumstances.14 As P. V. Ramana puts it, “If the military option were effective, then the problem should not have resurfaced after the initial Naxalbari uprising was suppressed.”15 Indeed, this group views overly aggressive action on the part of security forces as one of the contributing causes of further radicalization in..."

Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.2 Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh.

India’s Alternative Approach to COIN Generally speaking, the Indian take on COIN appears to depart from the approach advocated by Western doctrine that promotes a population-centric strategy to win “hearts and minds.”[4] Despite Indian official doctrine formally espousing this concept[5] and some contentions that India has always seen COIN as a “political rather than military problem,”[6] a closer look reveals that the Indian approach may be better characterized as a strategy of attrition[7] with the deployment of “raw state coercion”[8] and “enemy-centric” campaigns[9] to suffocate an insurgency through a “saturation of forces.”[10] At times it may involve the co-optation of elites to “buy-out” and contain an insurgency. [26] While some parts of the left-wing movement in India are willing to partly or fully embrace parliamentary politics to address issues of class, inequality, and distribution, the hardcore Naxalites remain unwilling to countenance democratic politics and seek the violent overthrow of the state through a variety of tactics.

The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government..."

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

In 2023, natural disasters caused an estimated $12 billion in economic losses, significantly exceeding the annual average of $8 billion over the past decade, according to a report by global insurance giant Swiss Re. Key Events in 2023 Floods in Northern India and Sikkim (July 2023): Affected Areas: Himachal Pradesh, including Shimla, and Delhi. India’s Unique Vulnerabilities Monsoon-Driven Floods: Contribution to Losses: Over the past two decades, floods have accounted for an average of 63% of annual economic losses. A major earthquake in the Himalayas or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the 2001 Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat. Challenges in Resilience and Insurance Despite the scale of economic losses, underinsurance remains a critical issue: Protection Gaps: Over 90% of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable.

Shapiro Oliver Vanden Eynde Katherine Ingram Emefa Addo Agawu Download link Download Abstract This report summarizes major policy changes since 1990 in India’s efforts to combat its communist insurgency. The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States. The affected States have approached the insurgency with a mixture of policies including negotiation, development programs, and security programs."

In the second half of the year, the focus will shift to the North Atlantic hurricane season, predicted to be exceptionally active due to record-warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the anticipated transition to La Niña ( Section 4.1). U.S. convective storms maintain focus on secondary perils In Section 3.1, WTW’s Scott St. George examines the fast start to the 2024 U.S. severe convective storm (SCS) season, which featured violent EF4 tornadoes in Oklahoma and Iowa as well as a derecho in Houston. In Section 3.2, WTW’s Arash Nassirpour, Elide Pantoli and James Dalziel explain that in Japan, most failures were concentrated in areas prone to liquefaction, while in Taiwan, soft-story collapse was the primary issue. Drought-induced risks in food supply chains In Section 3.7, an article by WTW’s Neil Gunn and co-authors discusses the impact of a prolonged drought in the Mediterranean region on agricultural production, focusing on the olive industry. The drought, caused by meteorological and hydrological factors, led to impaired crop yields and a 2.5-fold increase in olive oil prices, highlighting the vulnerability of food supply chains to climatic disruptions. With climate change predicted to increase drought risk in many parts of the world, businesses are advised to adopt effective strategies to assess and mitigate potential drought-related impacts on their operations and supply chains.

For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs.

They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was assaulted and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed Hindutva, the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the..."

The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance..."

Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus,..."

India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than..."

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries.

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing..."

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected....

As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come..."

Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August.

On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up..."

[] (Stratfor) The White House announced May 31 that it had revoked India's tariff benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance..."
