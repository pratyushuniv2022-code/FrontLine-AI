    "summary": "**A Triangle Made in History** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is mired in a convoluted history of unresolved border disputes, with military confrontations between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and India and Pakistan at the Line of Control (LoC) occurring intermittently. **The Triangle in Contemporary Times** What characterizes this triangle is the geographical proximity of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. However, the Pakistani response to any India-China border confrontation, and a Chinese response to an India-Pakistan war or a military standoff at the borders, is **more tacit than overt**, since the China-Pakistan strategic alliance does not have any unambiguous notion of the two countries coming to each other’s help in the event of a war. The interlocking threat perceptions and responses in the triangle hence cannot be decoupled from the U.S. strategy in the region, making the strategic chain an effective complement to explain the geopolitics of Southern Asia. Infrastructure building in the border areas and the issue of terrain advantage has been a **major source of contention**, particularly, as seen in the current clashes between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh, or in the earlier Doklam standoff. This should include talking to the Taliban, to secure its interest in Afghanistan, in the event of an American withdrawal, the return of the Taliban as a..."

China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and..."

Aligned with China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) and bolstered by pseudo-private contractors such as i-SOON (Anxun Information Technology Co., Ltd.), Salt Typhoon employs custom firmware implants, living-off-the-land binaries, and stealthy router rootkits to maintain persistent, covert access within major telecom environments across the United States, United Kingdom, Taiwan, and the EU. **State-Sponsored Espionage and Persistent Access** Salt Typhoon initiates operations by scanning for and exploiting known CVEs in network edge devices routers, VPN concentrators, and firewalls often combining automated brute-force methods with unpatched software vulnerabilities.

Whatever New Delhi says, if the IWT were still in active operation, it would ensure close collaboration and continuous information exchange between India and Pakistan in the face of surging water levels that threaten lives and livelihoods in both countries. Although India and Pakistan came to a shaky truce on May 10, India has continued its suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, and both Modi and his chief henchman, Home Minister Amit Shah, have repeatedly vowed that New Delhi will not return to it, without—at the very least—a renegotiation to make it more favorable to India.

The full details of the incident are shrouded in ambiguity, but it involved Chinese soldiers pitching tents around the Galwan Valley and their forceful eviction by the Indian Army—there is little clarity on whether China’s People’s Liberation Army had agreed to abandon these positions. “We were taken by surprise by how well prepared they were for the clash,” a top officer at the army headquarters in Delhi, who was part of the decision-making in the Ladakh crisis, told me.

Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions.

A majority of the information intercepted by the hackers involved either people working for the government or people involved in politics \\[1\\]. Background With growing tensions between China and the US over things like trade, military build-up, and Taiwan, China has invested a lot of time and effort into their cybersecurity/cyber espionage military departments. Due to the nature of the companies that have been compromised, the theoretical scope of the attacks could reach almost everybody who uses a phone in the United States. Since the attackers have not yet been removed completely from the networks they have compromised, it is important to note that the scope may increase even further. Other miscellaneous information that has been compromised as a result of the attacks include caller and receiver phone numbers, call durations, call types, and the location of cell towers used \\[4\\].

[] Tensions are rising among India, Pakistan and China amid rumors of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops entering Kashmir through Gilgit-Baltistan region. Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. Article Search * * * !

Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims.

Both the magnitude of the inflation shock as well as the composition among components will be important for gauging the risks of more persistent price pressure. **The cost shock from tariffs** To translate higher import prices into domestic inflation, we create an Input-Output table price model, which enables us to analyze the impact of higher import prices on domestic inflation by considering the indirect impact through inter-industry transactions in addition to the direct impact through import prices of finished consumer goods. Sensitivity of categories impacted by 20% non-energy tariffs on PCE prices for tariff-sensitive components Using the Input-Output table, we impose shocks of 10%, 20%, and 33% increases in import prices for non-energy goods and estimate the impact on PCE inflation, corresponding to our “aggressive,” “base case,” and “moderate scenarios.” Under the base case, our model suggests 20% tariffs push up the PCE price index by 1.4pp with about 40% of the price shocks stemming through higher production cost increases for domestic producers. Beyond the magnitude of any inflation surprises, the composition of inflation will provide important clues as to whether tariffs are a one-off shock or a source of more persistent price pressure.

On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry...

The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy..."

Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

The project was developed by the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and integrates a mix of artificial intelligence, anomaly detection, on-board inspection, autonomous decision-making, and even “intelligent deception” designed to mislead potential attackers. “By embedding censorship, surveillance logic, and active defense techniques directly into space infrastructure, China is shaping the rules of the satellite internet race in ways that challenge open-network models such as Starlink,” the group said. The “Satellite Internet Firewall” was independently developed by the National Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications at BUPT, under the leadership of Professors Zhao Yongli and Zhang Jie, and guided by Academician Guo Shize. Beiyou News said the project marked “a historic step forward” for China in satellite internet security, describing it as the world’s first multi-dimensional integrated security payload capable of protecting both the physical and network layers of satellite internet systems. The news outlet described the achievement as supporting China’s mission of “serving national needs, targeting international frontiers, focusing on scientific and technological innovation, and supporting major scientific and technological projects and national security needs.” HRIC underscored the symbolic dimension of the launch: the export of the “Great Firewall” from terrestrial networks to orbital systems.

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing..."
