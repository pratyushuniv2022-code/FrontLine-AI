To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests.

So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory.

Advertisment On April 28, 2025, the Spanish and Portuguese electricity grids collapsed, causing a total voltage outage and disconnecting the region from the continental European grid. **The Incident** At the time, Spain and Portugal were experiencing low demand alongside very high renewable penetration—82% in Spain and 91% in Portugal. According to Powergrid’s report, around 7,400 MW of gas and 3,000 MW of nuclear capacity went offline, taking the total outage to 12,800 MW. Advertisment **Factors Behind Grid Instability** Minutes of a meeting chaired by the Secretary (Power) on August 27, 2025, revealed that insufficient reactive power and voltage control, poor damping of oscillations, and cascade tripping due to overvoltage were the root causes of the blackout.

Consequently, India’s domestic illiberalism and trade mercantilism were discounted as administration officials sought to build new partnerships in high technology, entice businesses diversifying from China to invest in India, and position India as a new manufacturing node to limit China’s industrial dominance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his senior aides rushed to Washington to meet the president in a highly choreographed display of bonhomie, attempting to reassure him that unlike many of his other national targets, India is neither a free-loading ally nor a foe and would be a valuable partner in his “Make America Great Again” efforts. Beyond lavishly congratulating Trump for attempting to end the Ukraine war, Modi even offered a cheesy public endorsement of MAGA with a twist intended to protect India’s equities—all intended to deflect the ravages of Trump’s new policies. These solutions and others are driven by the imperative of protecting India’s relationship with the United States in the changed circumstances—a partnership that is vital both for India’s economic growth through continued access to the U.S. market and for geopolitical assurance in the face of India’s continued distrust of China.

This may be explained by the relatively low incentives for Canada and Mexico to conduct APT operations, and, considering that the United States (US) represents the majority of this share, perhaps it is reflective of America’s reliance on alternative cyber operations beyond traditional APT campaigns, including activities that are not publicly visible. Moreover, as the frequency of APT attacks continues to increase, individuals and organisations, particularly in highly targeted countries such as the US, may become increasingly sceptical of the security and reliability of digital platforms, especially those underpinning critical infrastructure or holding sensitive data.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

[] (Shutterstock) My colleague recently wrote that ransomware has so far undoubtedly been the “defining cyber threat” of 2021. I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus,..."

Besides dropping its reticence on joining more assertive and critical voices in global or regional coalitions, especially BRICS, India is accelerating efforts to normalise and improve relations with China that had weakened and almost broken down after the conflict in the Galwan river valley in Ladakh in 2020. The first is that most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) would be looking to diversify away from the US to other markets irrespective of the level of tariff they have been subjected to.

NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose new tariffs on a wide range of imports from India, ostensibly a penalty for buying Russian oil, represents another shock to the international trading system – and a sharp reversal of good relations with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift, and I know from my own experience that Indian exporters of both goods and services have already begun to intensify their efforts to develop business links in OECD markets other than the US. This defensive posture is shaped by skepticism toward the West – a holdover from the colonial period – and a belief in self-reliance to the point of autarky, often at the expense of efficiency and growth. Trump’s new tariffs have provided ammunition to the proponents of this more insular vision by bolstering the narrative that the global system is unreliable, and that engagement with the West is ultimately harmful to India’s interests and security. The country’s optimal response to US protectionism is not to retaliate or retreat, but to seek and cultivate other partners that remain committed to rules-based international trade. By deepening trade and investment ties with the UK, the EU, Japan, and Australia, India can recalibrate its economic relationships..."

On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry...

Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing..."

    "summary": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India..."

Fishermen get ready to cast their net on the Brahmaputra River, part of a massive river system that India shares with China, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. (BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity..."

The US is one of the few major economies with which India enjoys a trade surplus — $46 billion as of 2024. Trump effect: Additional US tariffs on India Compiled by Murali Kallummal, Professor, Centre for WTO Studies, IIFT According to a recent study by the Global Trade Research Initiative ( GTRI), the most affected agricultural segments will be fish, meat, and processed seafood — which together accounted for $2.58 billion in exports to the US last year. The Indian government had worked to position the country as a viable alternative to China under the China+1 strategy, especially in smartphone manufacturing. A crucial step would be to fast-track the ongoing negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US. In March, New Delhi signed the terms of reference for a BTA following a push from the Prime Minister’s Office. Xi emphasised the need for mutual modernisation between China and India as leading voices of the Global South — perhaps suggesting a pivot away from overreliance on Western markets. **The road ahead** The 26% reciprocal tariff may compel India to re-examine its own tariff structures, not just in response to the US, but to remain competitive in global markets."

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ..."

On May 26-27, Malaysia, as the 2025 ASEAN chair, hosted a series of summits that underscored ASEAN's broad dual-track initiatives to bolster intra-bloc trade and trade diversification. The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices. Leaders also committed to finalizing an upgraded ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement by October, which aims to further liberalize regional markets and boost intra-ASEAN trade beyond..."
