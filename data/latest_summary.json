[] Authors - S - Ajai Shukla Back In Brief Is the growing militarisation of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) — the 3488-kilometre long de facto border between China and India — an invitation to open confrontation between the Asian giants? Could the Sino–Indian border become like the Line of Control (LoC) — the unsettled, 776-kilometre de facto border with Pakistan — a flashpoint where daily jostling between bitter enemies carries the danger of armed clashes and even outright war? But that is very different from the Indo–Pakistani LoC where, despite a cease-fire agreement in 2003, soldiers continue to die in cross-border firing and militants continue to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir, supported by the Pakistan Army. China is a study in contrast: while resolutely stonewalling the exchange of signed maps (and, therefore, leaving the door open to expanding its holdings) the People’s Liberation Army has never militarily violated the LAC status quo. Given China’s massive military deployments in Tibet and Xinjiang, and its expanding road and rail infrastructure that already allows it to concentrate seven to nine divisions within a fortnight for an offensive against a chosen point in India’s defences, the Indian..."

These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. [\\[2\\]] While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]] The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police..."

    "summary": "_China’s narrative and material backing of Pakistan throughout the current Kashmir crisis is worrying India’s overstretched military._ India and Pakistan are embroiled in hostilities in the aftermath of a terror attack on civilians in Pahalgam, Kashmir on April 22. This is because an India that is concerned about dealing with the security threat from Pakistan, or one that is diverting resources and capital to its Western border, is an India that is distracted from the Chinese threat. This threat is not only on the northern and eastern borders but also in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), restricting India’s focus to its continental theater and away from a naval one. These range from seeking an “ impartial investigation” to recounting India’s defeat in the 1962 war to amplifying Islamabad’s claims of low-lying flooding due to India’s manipulation of the Indus River’s waters. The latter claim is especially unsubstantiated, given that even if there are higher levels of water recorded in Jhelum in the past few days, it is likely a result of the seasonal melting of glaciers—something the Lahore Flood Forecasting Division itself warned residents of, on April 18. This means that if the conflict with Pakistan drags on, there will be a need to service and secure weapons systems and defense components that can match the strength of Chinese-made Pakistani equipment while also ensuring that both the LAC and the LoC have enough strength to deal with incursions and skirmishes on the ground. It must make the case that India..."

Advertisment On April 28, 2025, the Spanish and Portuguese electricity grids collapsed, causing a total voltage outage and disconnecting the region from the continental European grid. **The Incident** At the time, Spain and Portugal were experiencing low demand alongside very high renewable penetration—82% in Spain and 91% in Portugal. According to Powergrid’s report, around 7,400 MW of gas and 3,000 MW of nuclear capacity went offline, taking the total outage to 12,800 MW. Advertisment **Factors Behind Grid Instability** Minutes of a meeting chaired by the Secretary (Power) on August 27, 2025, revealed that insufficient reactive power and voltage control, poor damping of oscillations, and cascade tripping due to overvoltage were the root causes of the blackout.

So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was set to arrive in India on Oct. 11 for an informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mamallapuram. Xi hosted Modi last year after bilateral ties deteriorated during the 2017 Doklam standoff, in which thousands of Indian and Chinese troops nearly came to blows. For Xi, a preoccupation with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war as part of Beijing's broader strategic competition with Washington explains why he wants calm with neighbors like New Delhi. And for Modi, a desire to avoid confrontation with China -- the superior military and economic power -- explains why he wishes to sustain high-level dialogue with Xi. Ultimately, however, any dialogue will strive purely to manage tensions, which will only grow in the long run..."

This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ..."

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations.

[] (Stratfor) On Sept. 24, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, raising expectations that the two sides were poised to reveal a new trade deal following months of talks. But according to information leaked from the meeting, the negotiators failed to agree on Indian concessions on information and communication technology, dairy, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, e-commerce, and data localization -- in short, every bone of contention that has stymied an agreement for months. Still, U.S. President Donald Trump told visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi the same day that they would be able to announce a trade deal soon. ...

(NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain..."
