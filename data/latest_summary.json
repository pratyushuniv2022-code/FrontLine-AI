India’s Alternative Approach to COIN Generally speaking, the Indian take on COIN appears to depart from the approach advocated by Western doctrine that promotes a population-centric strategy to win “hearts and minds.”[4] Despite Indian official doctrine formally espousing this concept[5] and some contentions that India has always seen COIN as a “political rather than military problem,”[6] a closer look reveals that the Indian approach may be better characterized as a strategy of attrition[7] with the deployment of “raw state coercion”[8] and “enemy-centric” campaigns[9] to suffocate an insurgency through a “saturation of forces.”[10] At times it may involve the co-optation of elites to “buy-out” and contain an insurgency. [26] While some parts of the left-wing movement in India are willing to partly or fully embrace parliamentary politics to address issues of class, inequality, and distribution, the hardcore Naxalites remain unwilling to countenance democratic politics and seek the violent overthrow of the state through a variety of tactics.

However, the Pakistani response to any India-China border confrontation, and a Chinese response to an India-Pakistan war or a military standoff at the borders, is **more tacit than overt**, since the China-Pakistan strategic alliance does not have any unambiguous notion of the two countries coming to each other’s help in the event of a war. The interlocking threat perceptions and responses in the triangle hence cannot be decoupled from the U.S. strategy in the region, making the strategic chain an effective complement to explain the geopolitics of Southern Asia. Infrastructure building in the border areas and the issue of terrain advantage has been a **major source of contention**, particularly, as seen in the current clashes between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh, or in the earlier Doklam standoff.

Earlier this year, the automaker paused exports to the United States after tariffs imposed under former President Donald Trump, which triggered a steep decline in sales.

According to the complaint, Jubair — known online as “EarthtoStar,” “Brad,” “Austin,” and “@autistic” — conspired to infiltrate U.S. corporate and government networks, steal sensitive data, and extort victims for millions. “ _From as early as May 2022 to as recently as September 2025, Jubair and his associates were involved in approximately 120 network intrusions, including accessing the computer networks of at least 47 U.S.-based victims,_” the DOJ stated. Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti underscored the scale of the damage: “ _Jubair is alleged to have participated in a sweeping cyber extortion scheme carried out by a group known as Scattered Spider, which committed at least 120 attacks worldwide and resulted in over $115 million in ransom payments from victims. These malicious attacks caused widespread disruption to U.S. businesses and organizations, including critical infrastructure and the federal court system_.” The complaint alleges Jubair personally targeted a U.S.-based critical infrastructure company and the U.S. Courts between October 2024 and January 2025. “ _As alleged by the complaint, Jubair went to great and sophisticated lengths to keep himself anonymous while he and his criminal associates continued to attack these victims and extort tens of millions..."

According to the alert, “ _Both groups have recently been observed targeting organizations’ Salesforce platforms via different initial access mechanisms_.” The FBI urges enterprises to review the provided indicators of compromise (IOCs) and strengthen defenses. The alert explains, “ _UNC6040 threat actors commonly call victims’ call centers posing as IT support employees… Under the guise of closing an auto-generated ticket, UNC6040 actors trick customer support employees into taking actions that grant the attackers access_.” Key tactics include: - Credential Harvesting – Directly requesting usernames, passwords, and MFA codes.

Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how.

As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Thus far, only sporadic violent plots and a few low-level attacks have targeted AI infrastructure like data centers. For the most part, pushback has taken the form of rhetoric and some nonviolent protests. The muted response reflects the fact that, for now, AI has yet to significantly demonstrate the type of grand promises or perils forecast by its dreamers or doomsdayers. This will not last. As AI ripples across societies and workplaces, upending daily life, labor markets and politics, the upheaval will inevitably spark backlash -- and at least some of the aggrieved will resort to violence....

Advertisement Power imports, mainly from an Adani Power-run coal-fired plant in eastern India, rose 70 per cent in the seven months through July and helped satisfy most of the rising demand, government data showed. Natural gas accounted for about two-thirds of Bangladesh’s power demand in the decade that ended in 2020, but the country has been boosting power imports and local coal-fired generation due to gas infrastructure challenges and to cut costs. “It’s about cost-effectiveness, and gas is required for the fertiliser industry, whereas cheap electricity can be received from other sources, including fuel oil,” said Adeeba Aziz Khan, director of Bangladesh’s Summit Power. Her firm runs a dozen power plants using gas and fuel oil.

Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies.

Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries.

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing..."

India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance..."
