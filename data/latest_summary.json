The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations.

This intensification is driven by a confluence of factors: the weaponization of Artificial Intelligence, persistent vulnerabilities across digital supply chains and the Internet of Things (IoT), and escalating geopolitical tensions fueling aggressive state-sponsored operations. Concurrently, the lines between nation-state espionage and financially motivated cybercrime are blurring, exemplified by the emergence of hybrid threats like the **Warlock ransomware**, operated by the China-based actor **Storm-2603**, which targets critical infrastructure using zero-day vulnerabilities and novel data auction tactics. Major campaigns in 2025, such as the widespread compromise of Salesforce instances by the **ShinyHunters** group and the crippling ransomware attack on **Collins Aerospace's** aviation software, underscore the critical risk posed by supply chain vulnerabilities. In the U.S., the SEC's mandatory 4-day disclosure rule for material incidents, CISA's upcoming 72-hour reporting rule under **CIRCIA**, and significant proposed updates to the **HIPAA Security Rule** are forcing organizations to prioritize transparency and accountability.

So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics.

The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States.

For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs.

They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was assaulted and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed Hindutva, the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the..."

On trade, the US and India have held five rounds of negotiations, where India offered zero tariffs on industrial goods, and agreed to gradually reduce tariffs on US cars, but disagreements emerged over India’s reluctance to open its agriculture (genetically modified crops) and dairy sectors, which are politically important for President Trump. A fundamental misalignment also emerged between the two nations' approaches: India sought a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, while it appears the Trump administration preferred a quick deal. On the other hand, if both sides dig in their heels, resulting in a continuation of the 50% tariff rate, then we would expect the hit to GDP growth to be 0.8 percentage points on an annualized rate basis. With the new tariff structure, the cost differential between India and China has narrowed, and between India and Southeast Asian competitors, it has moved in favor of the latter. This could have various effects on the shape of new supply chains such as the negative impact on textiles, leather and toys, and Indian firms possibly relocating their production to lower tariff countries to retain their US customer base. We expect the government to announce a multi-pronged response, with fiscal and financial support for exporters, focus on export diversification and fast-tracking free trade agreements.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry...

Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected....

Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems &amp; jewelry, dairy &amp; agriculture, machinery &amp; engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems &amp; jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of..."

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ..."

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain..."

The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices. Leaders also committed to finalizing an upgraded ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement by October, which aims to further liberalize regional markets and boost intra-ASEAN trade beyond..."
