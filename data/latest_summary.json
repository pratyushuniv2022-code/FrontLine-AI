[\\[2\\]] While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]] The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police..."

    "summary": "_China’s narrative and material backing of Pakistan throughout the current Kashmir crisis is worrying India’s overstretched military._ India and Pakistan are embroiled in hostilities in the aftermath of a terror attack on civilians in Pahalgam, Kashmir on April 22. This is because an India that is concerned about dealing with the security threat from Pakistan, or one that is diverting resources and capital to its Western border, is an India that is distracted from the Chinese threat. This threat is not only on the northern and eastern borders but also in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), restricting India’s focus to its continental theater and away from a naval one. These range from seeking an “ impartial investigation” to recounting India’s defeat in the 1962 war to amplifying Islamabad’s claims of low-lying flooding due to India’s manipulation of the Indus River’s waters. The latter claim is especially unsubstantiated, given that even if there are higher levels of water recorded in Jhelum in the past few days, it is likely a result of the seasonal melting of glaciers—something the Lahore Flood Forecasting Division itself warned residents of, on April 18. This means that if the conflict with Pakistan drags on, there will be a need to service and secure weapons systems and defense components that can match the strength of Chinese-made Pakistani equipment while also ensuring that both the LAC and the LoC have enough strength to deal with incursions and skirmishes on the ground.

Advertisment On April 28, 2025, the Spanish and Portuguese electricity grids collapsed, causing a total voltage outage and disconnecting the region from the continental European grid. **The Incident** At the time, Spain and Portugal were experiencing low demand alongside very high renewable penetration—82% in Spain and 91% in Portugal. According to Powergrid’s report, around 7,400 MW of gas and 3,000 MW of nuclear capacity went offline, taking the total outage to 12,800 MW. Advertisment **Factors Behind Grid Instability** Minutes of a meeting chaired by the Secretary (Power) on August 27, 2025, revealed that insufficient reactive power and voltage control, poor damping of oscillations, and cascade tripping due to overvoltage were the root causes of the blackout.

So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics.

To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade. But that may start to change. As China forges deeper ties with India's nuclear archrival, Pakistan, and as each..."

When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has publicly attributed the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge.

On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was set to arrive in India on Oct. 11 for an informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mamallapuram. Xi hosted Modi last year after bilateral ties deteriorated during the 2017 Doklam standoff, in which thousands of Indian and Chinese troops nearly came to blows. For Xi, a preoccupation with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war as part of Beijing's broader strategic competition with Washington explains why he wants calm with neighbors like New Delhi. And for Modi, a desire to avoid confrontation with China -- the superior military and economic power -- explains why he wishes to sustain high-level dialogue with Xi. Ultimately, however, any dialogue will strive purely to manage tensions, which will only grow in the long run..."

Integrated with advanced distribution management systems (ADMS), outage management in smart grids helps balance distributed energy resources (DERs) while ensuring grid stability during disruptions. Automated rerouting of power supply reduces downtime and improves resilience. Customer communication is another critical benefit, as smart grids allow utilities to send automated updates and restoration timelines directly to users.

These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine.

In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations.
