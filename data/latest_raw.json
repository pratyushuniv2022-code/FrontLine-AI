How is it determined? Describe various elements of a resilience framework. Also mention the global targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030). **Linkage:** _The article explicitly states that the NDMA has ‚Äúmarkedly accelerated its efforts to manage these increasing risks‚Äù and initiated a ‚Äúproactive shift from mere post-disaster response to risk reduction through its Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction (CoDRR)‚Äù. This directly links to the concept of ‚Äúdisaster resilience‚Äù and ‚ÄúDisaster Risk Reduction (DRR),‚Äù which are central to India‚Äôs preparedness strategy for GLOF events._ | **_Mentor‚Äôs Comment:_** _On_ **_July 8, 2025_** _,_ **_Nepal experienced a major Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF)_** _, which triggered a_ **_flash flood along the Lende River_** _, destroying a_ **_China-built friendship bridge_** _and disabling_ **_four hydropower plants_** _, cutting off_ **_8% of Nepal‚Äôs power supply_** _. This catastrophe highlights the_ **_growing threat of GLOFs_** _due to_ **_glacial melt from rising temperatures_** _in the Himalayas. The incident has raised concerns over the_ **_lack of trans-boundary early warning systems_** _, particularly between_ **_China and Nepal_** _. It also drew attention to_ **_India‚Äôs vulnerability_** _, as the_ **_Indian Himalayan Region (IHR)_** _contains_ **_7,500 glacial lakes_** _, many at high risk of GLOF due to_ **_climate change, poor monitoring infrastructure, and lack of early warning systems_** _. India‚Äôs_ **_National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)_** _has responded by launching a_ **_national programme targeting 195 at-risk glacial lakes_** _, focusing on_ **_hazard assessment, early warning systems, risk mitigation, and community engagement_** _._ _Today‚Äôs editorial analyses the_ **_major Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) in Himalaya region._** _This topic is important for_ **_GS Paper III (Environment)_** _in the UPSC mains exam._ _\\__ _Let‚Äôs learn!_ **Why in the News?** **Recently**, **Nepal** faced a major **Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF)**, which led to a sudden **flash flood** along the **Lende River**. | | | --- | | **What are GLOFs?** - **GLOFs** are sudden floods caused by the **breach of natural or man-made dams** holding **glacial lakes**, releasing large volumes of water. - **Himalayan Spread**: The **Himalayas** across **India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet** host thousands of **glacial lakes**, many near **international borders**. India has **7,500+ glacial lakes**, with **200+ deemed potentially dangerous**. | ### **What are their transboundary risks in the Himalayas?** - **Trans-boundary Risk**: GLOFs from **upstream countries** (e.g. **China**) can impact **downstream nations** ( **India, Nepal, Bhutan**) **without early warning**. **Eg:** The **July 2024 Tibetan GLOF** damaged Nepal‚Äôs **Rasuwagadhi hydropower project** with **no prior alert**. - **Lack of Data Sharing**: **Minimal real-time data exchange** between neighbours hampers **early warning** and **risk management**. **Eg:** **Nepal** got **no warning** from **China** during the **2024 GLOF**. ### **How has climate change increased GLOF frequency in the IHR?** - **Accelerated Glacier Melting**: **Rising temperatures** cause **glacier retreat** and formation of **unstable glacial lakes**. **Eg:** **Milam Glacier**, Uttarakhand shows rapid retreat, increasing **GLOF risk**. - **Extreme Precipitation**: **Intense rainfall** from **climate change** can overfill lakes, causing breaches. **Eg:** **Gya GLOF (2014)** in **Ladakh** followed **heavy rainfall**, damaging infrastructure. - **Increased Landslides**: **Thawing permafrost** and unstable slopes trigger **landslides** into lakes, displacing water and causing GLOFs. **Eg:** **2013 Chorabari Glacier landslide** near **Kedarnath** worsened the flood impact. ### **What measures has India taken for GLOF mitigation?** - **Early Warning Systems (EWS)**: Installed to detect **rising water levels** and trigger alerts. **Eg:** EWS at **South Lhonak Lake**, **Sikkim** before **2023 GLOF**. - **Satellite Monitoring**: **ISRO-NRSC** use **remote sensing** to track glacial lakes. **Eg:** Monitored via **Bhuvan portal** in **Ladakh**, **Uttarakhand**, **Himachal Pradesh**. - **Risk Mapping**: **NMSHE** identifies **high-risk areas** for targeted intervention. **Eg:** Studies in **Kinnaur** and **Chamoli** flagged vulnerable lakes. - **Engineering Measures**: **Lake drainage** and structural control to prevent overflow. **Eg:** Work at **Tsho Rolpa Lake** (Nepal) as a replicable model. - **Community Preparedness**: **NDMA** and states run **drills and awareness programs**. **Eg:** Mock drills in **Uttarkashi** and **Kullu**. **What are the gaps?** - **Weak Early Warning Systems (EWS)**: India lacks **real-time sensors**, **automated sirens**, and **alert mechanisms**. **Eg:** No early alerts during **Chamoli disaster (2021)**. - **Low Community Preparedness**: Most villages in **Sikkim** and **Uttarakhand** lack **evacuation protocols** and **disaster training**. - **Poor Transboundary Coordination**: Minimal data sharing with **China** hinders **early action** in regions like **Arunachal Pradesh**. - **Infrastructure Vulnerability**: **Bridges** and **dams** not designed for GLOFs. **Eg:** **Chungthang dam breach (2023)** exposed weak infrastructure. - **Limited Scientific Capacity**: Shortage of **glaciologists**, **risk modelers**, and **ground validation** limits **NDMA‚Äôs effectiveness**. **Way forward:** - **Strengthen Early Warning Systems**: Deploy real-time sensors, sirens, and automated alerts in high-risk zones. - **Enhance Transboundary Cooperation**: Establish formal data-sharing agreements with China, Nepal, and Bhutan. - **Build Local Preparedness**: Conduct regular community drills, awareness drives, and evacuation planning. - **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure**: Design dams, bridges, and power projects to withstand GLOF surges. - **Invest in Research & Capacity**: Train glaciologists, improve satellite-ground integration, and support Himalayan climate studies. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) | | | --- | | **PYQ Relevance:** **\\[UPSC 2020\\]** Discuss the geophysical characteristics of Circum-Pacific Zone. **Linakge:** _This question is about a region known for earthquakes and volcanoes. The article mainly talks about quakes caused by human activity but also mentions that these usually happen in places already on fault lines or where tectonic plates are shifting‚Äîareas like the Circum-Pacific. So, it‚Äôs important to understand these natural zones when looking at how human actions might trigger earthquakes._ | **_Mentor‚Äôs Comment:_** _Human-induced earthquakes are increasingly drawing scientific and public attention, as research shows that_ **_human activities like groundwater extraction, dam construction, and fracking can trigger or accelerate seismic activity_** _, particularly in_ **_tectonically sensitive regions_** _such as Delhi-NCR, the Western Ghats, and parts of Maharashtra and Kerala._ _Today‚Äôs editorial analyses the Issues related to_ **_Human-induced earthquakes in India._** _This topic is important for_ **_GS Paper I (Geography), GS Paper II (Governance)_** _and_ **_GS Paper III (Disaster Management)_** _in the UPSC mains exam._ _\\__ _Let‚Äôs learn!_ **Why in the News?** Recent studies in India have highlighted a **correlation between excessive groundwater depletion and increased seismic events**, especially in Delhi. | | | --- | | ### **What are human-induced earthquakes?** - These are earthquakes triggered by **human activities** rather than natural tectonic movements. Activities like **mining**, **groundwater extraction**, **building dams**, and **fracking** disturb the earth‚Äôs crust, causing seismic activity. Over **700 human-induced quakes** have been recorded globally in the last 150 years. | ### **How do activities like groundwater extraction and dams trigger quakes in India?** - **Groundwater Depletion Weakens Crustal Stability:** Excessive extraction of groundwater reduces **pore pressure**, leading to a **shift in stress** within the earth‚Äôs crust. **Eg:** In Delhi-NCR, increased seismic activity between 2003‚Äì2012 has been linked to excessive groundwater loss. - **Reservoir-Induced Seismicity (RIS):** The **weight of large reservoirs** exerts additional pressure on underlying faults, triggering quakes. **Eg:** The **1967 Koynanagar earthquake** (magnitude 6.3) was linked to the Koyna Dam in Maharashtra. - **Water Infiltration into Fault Zones:** Water from reservoirs or excessive irrigation can seep deep into fault lines, **lubricating them**, and making them more likely to slip. **Eg:** Seismic tremors near **Mullaperiyar Dam** in Kerala are suspected to be induced due to water infiltration in a seismically sensitive region. - **Load Variation Due to Filling and Emptying of Dams:** Rapid **filling or draining of reservoirs** changes the **stress distribution**, causing small or moderate tremors. **Eg:** In the Himalayan region, such stress changes are a concern for dams like **Tehri Dam**. - **Ground Subsidence from Overuse of Aquifers:** Excessive groundwater extraction leads to **land subsidence**, altering the natural **equilibrium of stress** in the crust. **Eg:** Regions in **North Gujarat** have experienced subsidence, making them more vulnerable to fault reactivation and quakes. ### **Why is Delhi-NCR prone to quakes from groundwater loss?** - **Rapid Groundwater Depletion Alters Stress Fields:** Excessive groundwater extraction reduces the **hydrostatic pressure** underground, disturbing the **natural stress balance** in fault zones. This **stress redistribution** can reactivate dormant faults, triggering seismic activity. **Eg:** Studies from **2003‚Äì2012** show increased microseismic activity in parts of **Gurgaon and Faridabad**, correlated with falling water tables. - **Aquifer-Related Land Subsidence:** Continuous overuse of aquifers causes the **land to sink** (subsidence), which can strain the Earth‚Äôs crust and disturb nearby fault lines. In Delhi-NCR, land sinking has been recorded in **Dwarka, Kapashera, and parts of Noida**, increasing quake risk. **Eg:** A **2021 study by IIT-Kanpur** showed that excessive aquifer use led to ground subsidence and elevated seismic hazard. - **Built-Up Pressure on Seismically Active Faults:** Delhi-NCR sits near the **Mahendragarh-Dehradun fault** and **Delhi-Haridwar ridge**, making it naturally earthquake-prone. When groundwater is extracted, it weakens the **structural resistance** of rocks, making nearby active faults more vulnerable. **Eg:** Minor tremors in **Rohini and West Delhi (2020-21)** were suspected to be linked to combined stress from tectonics and human activity. ### **How does climate change contribute to seismic risks?** - **Melting Glaciers Increase Uplift Pressure:** Rapid glacial melt in the Himalayas (due to rising temperatures) reduces surface weight. This triggers **isostatic rebound** ‚Äî the crust rises and shifts, which can **activate faults** beneath. **Eg:** In **Uttarkashi (Uttarakhand)**, increased seismic activity has been observed near retreating Gangotri Glacier, linked to glacial thinning and uplift. - **Changing Rainfall Patterns Cause Landslides and Crustal Stress:** Intense rainfall and flash floods (exacerbated by climate change) cause **rapid groundwater recharge and erosion**, disturbing fault stability. **Eg:** In **Kodagu (Karnataka)**, unusually heavy rains in 2018 triggered landslides and minor tremors due to destabilized slopes and crustal shifts. - **Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Seismic Pressure:** Rising sea levels increase water load on coastal plates, especially in delta regions. This can **suppress or activate tectonic stresses** near coastlines. **Eg:** In **Sundarbans (West Bengal)**, changes in sediment load and sea-level rise have raised concerns of future seismic risks in this low-lying, tectonically sensitive zone. | | | --- | | **What are the steps taken by the Indian Government?** - **Seismic Zoning and Monitoring:** India is divided into **four seismic zones (II to V)** to prioritize risk-based planning. The **National Centre for Seismology (NCS)** monitors seismic activity across the country in real-time. - **Implementation of Earthquake-Resistant Building Codes:** The **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)** has issued **IS codes** for earthquake-resistant construction. - **Capacity Building and Public Awareness: NDMA** and **NDRF** conduct training, mock drills, and awareness programs in vulnerable areas. | **Way forward:** - **Integrated Land and Water Management:** Promote sustainable groundwater use, recharge practices, and land-use planning to reduce land subsidence and seismic vulnerability. - **Expand Monitoring and Preparedness:** Enhance seismic monitoring networks and public awareness programs to improve early warning systems and disaster resilience. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) | | | --- | | ## **PYQ Relevance:** **\\[UPSC 2024\\]** What is disaster resilience? How is it determined? Describe various elements of a resilience framework. Also mention the global targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030). **Linkage:** _This PYQ, focusing on ‚Äúdisaster resilience‚Äù and ‚ÄúDisaster Risk Reduction (DRR),‚Äù provides an excellent framework to discuss how catastrophe bonds (cat bonds) function as a financial planning tool for natural disasters. The article ‚ÄúCatastrophe Bonds: Insuring India‚Äôs Future Against Disasters‚Äù directly addresses the need for such instruments in India‚Äôs disaster management strategy._ | **_Mentor‚Äôs Comment:_** **_Catastrophe bonds (cat bonds)_** _are in the spotlight as_ **_India_** _explores_ **_innovative disaster risk financing_** _amid rising_ **_climate-related calamities_** _. With_ **_low disaster insurance penetration_** _, India is considering cat bonds to strengthen_ **_post-disaster response_** _, reduce_ **_fiscal shocks_** _, and lead a_ **_regional South Asian initiative_** _._ **_Global success stories_** _and_ **_India‚Äôs proactive mitigation funding_** _have revived interest in adopting this_ **_financial tool_** _._ _Today‚Äôs editorial analyses the_ **_Catastrophe bonds (cat bonds)._** _This topic is important for_ **_GS Paper III (Disaster Management)_** _in the UPSC mains exam._ _\\__ _Let‚Äôs learn!_ ## **Why in the News?** As **climate change** causes more frequent **disasters**, countries and insurers are using **cat bonds** to **manage risk**. These bonds help raise **funds** from **markets** for **recovery** and **rebuilding** after disasters. ## **What are catastrophe bonds?** - Catastrophe bonds are **risk-linked securities** that transfer **disaster risk from issuers (usually governments or insurers)** to investors. They are triggered when a **predefined catastrophic event** (like an earthquake, cyclone, or flood) occurs. - **Eg**: The World Bank issued cat bonds for **Mexico** and **Pacific Island countries** to cover tropical cyclone and earthquake risks. ## **How do they function as instruments for disaster risk financing?** - Governments (sponsors) pay premiums, and the **principal becomes the insured sum**; if a disaster hits, investors lose their principal, which goes to recovery. **Intermediaries** like the World Bank issue the bond, ensuring reliability and reduced counter-party risk. - They ensure **quicker payouts**, reduce dependency on budget allocations, and **transfer risk away from insurers** to global markets. ## **Why is disaster risk insurance penetration low in India?** - **Lack of Awareness and Financial Literacy:** Many individuals, especially in **rural and hazard-prone areas**, are unaware of the **importance or availability of disaster insurance**. **Eg:** **Farmers** vulnerable to **floods or droughts** often rely on **government relief** instead of purchasing **crop insurance**. - **High Premium Costs and Perceived Low Returns: Insurance premiums** are often considered **unaffordable** or **unnecessary**, especially when disasters seem unlikely in the short term. **Eg:** Urban **households** in **seismic zones** like **Delhi-NCR** rarely insure homes against **earthquakes**. - **Limited Private Sector Participation and Poor Outreach:** The **insurance market** remains **underdeveloped**, with few **disaster-specific products** and limited **last-mile delivery mechanisms**. **Eg:** **MSMEs** in **coastal Odisha** remain **uninsured** despite repeated **cyclone exposure** due to poor **insurer penetration**. ## **How can cat bonds address this gap?** - **Access to Global Capital Markets:** Cat bonds transfer **disaster risk** from governments to **global investors**, increasing the **funding pool** for **post-disaster recovery**. **Eg:** After **Hurricane Maria (2017)**, **Mexico** accessed **$150 million** via a **World Bank-backed cat bond**, enabling **rapid relief**. - **Ensure Quick Payouts for Emergencies:** Cat bonds use **trigger-based mechanisms** (e.g. **earthquake magnitude**, **wind speed**) to enable **fast disbursement** of funds. **Eg:** In **2021**, the **Philippines** received **$52.5 million** within **weeks** after **Typhoon Rai**, due to **pre-agreed cat bond triggers**. - **Reduce Fiscal Pressure on Governments:** Pre-disaster financing through cat bonds helps **avoid budget shocks** and **reduce dependency** on **ad-hoc aid or borrowing**. **Eg:** A **cyclone-risk cat bond** for **Bay of Bengal** can pre-finance relief for **Odisha** and **Andhra Pradesh**. ## **How can India benefit from a regional South Asian cat bond?** - **Shared Risk Pooling for Cost Efficiency:** By joining a **regional cat bond** with countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, India can **pool disaster risks**, reducing the premium burden and increasing affordability. **Eg:** The **Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company (PCRIC)** pools risk for Pacific island nations, lowering overall costs. - **Boosts Regional Cooperation and Preparedness:** A shared bond encourages **joint early warning systems**, emergency planning, and data sharing, improving **collective disaster readiness**. **Eg:** SAARC Disaster Management Centre can coordinate common triggers and payout parameters across South Asia. - **Access to Larger and Diverse Capital Markets:** A regional bond can attract **more global investors** by offering diversified risk, improving fund availability post-disaster for **quick response and recovery**. **Eg:** The **World Bank‚Äôs Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (SEADRIF)** supports countries like Laos and Myanmar through pooled financing. ## **What are the key risks in designing and implementing cat bonds?** - **Basis Risk (Mismatch Between Trigger and Actual Loss):** There‚Äôs a risk that the bond may not pay out even when severe losses occur, if the predefined **trigger (e.g., earthquake magnitude or rainfall level)** is not met, undermining trust and utility. - **High Setup and Transaction Costs:** Cat bonds require **specialized modeling, legal structuring, and investor engagement**, which may be **too complex or expensive** for lower-income or disaster-prone regions without external support. ## **Why should India diversify its disaster financing amid climate risks?** - **Rising Frequency and Intensity of Disasters:** Climate change is increasing the number of **extreme weather events** like floods, cyclones, and droughts. **Sole reliance on budgetary support and relief funds is unsustainable**, making diversified financing (like cat bonds, parametric insurance) essential. - **Reducing Fiscal Burden and Ensuring Faster Relief:** A diversified disaster financing system helps **minimize delays in post-disaster response** and **lessens pressure on state and central budgets**, allowing for **quick payouts and resilient recovery**. ## **Way forward:** - **Promote Risk-Based Financing Instruments:** Encourage the use of **catastrophe bonds**, **parametric insurance**, and **public-private partnerships** to diversify disaster risk funding and ensure timely payouts. - **Strengthen Institutional Capacity and Data Systems:** Develop **robust disaster risk assessment tools**, improve **climate modelling**, and integrate **early warning systems** to design effective and credible financial instruments. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) ## **Why in the News?** A **tragic pattern** keeps repeating in **Tamil Nadu‚Äôs firecracker industry**, especially in **Virudhunagar district**, where **frequent explosions** continue to **injure and kill workers**. In the **first half of 2025** alone, **eight accidents** have taken **26 lives**‚Äîadding to a steady trend of **52 deaths in 2024** and **79 in 2023**. ## **What causes repeated accidents in Tamil Nadu‚Äôs fireworks industry?** - **Unsafe Handling of Chemicals:** Accidents often result from **friction during the mixing or filling of explosive chemicals**, which easily ignite. Eg: In the **2025 Sattur explosion**, preliminary reports blamed **friction during chemical filling** for the blast. - **Improper Storage of Inflammable Materials:** Fireworks units **store chemicals in unsafe conditions**, often **exposed to direct sunlight and heat**, violating safety norms. Eg: **Explosives Rules, 2008** prohibit **storage under excessive heat**, but violations continue in units across **Virudhunagar**. - **High Ambient Temperatures:** The **hot and dry climate of Virudhunagar**, especially during summer, increases the likelihood of **spontaneous ignition**. - **Negligence by Manufacturers:** Many factory owners **ignore safety protocols** to save time and cost, compromising **worker safety**. - **Inadequate Regulatory Oversight:** Despite being licensed by **PESO**, **regulatory inspections** are **infrequent or ineffective**, allowing unsafe practices to persist. | | | --- | | ## **What are the safety regulations in India?** - **Explosives Rules, 2008** (under Explosives Act, 1884): Regulates licensing, safe storage, handling, and transport of explosives. - **Factories Act, 1948**: Ensures worker safety through ventilation, PPE (‚Äã‚ÄãPersonal Protective Equipment), safety training, and health monitoring. - **Environment (Protection) Act, 1986**: Mandates pollution control, hazardous waste management, and environmental safeguards. - **Disaster Management Act, 2005**: Requires emergency response plans, mock drills, and local authority coordination. - **PESO Guidelines**: Enforces safety standards in explosives units and conducts inspections for compliance. - **National Building Code (NBC), 2016**: Prescribes fire safety, exits, alarms, and structural norms for industrial buildings. - **Indian Boilers Act, 1923**: Ensures safe operation and periodic inspection of industrial boilers. | ## **Why is safety regulation ineffective despite existing laws?** - **Weak Enforcement of Existing Laws:** The **Explosives Rules, 2008** mandate strict precautions, such as **protecting explosives from sunlight and heat**, but **enforcement is lax**. Eg: Despite clear rules, multiple units in **Virudhunagar** continue to **store chemicals in open areas**, leading to repeat accidents. - **Lack of Regular and Stringent Inspections:** Regulatory bodies like **PESO (Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization)** often **fail to conduct timely and thorough inspections**, enabling rule violations. - **Absence of Accountability and Deterrence:** Post-accident **investigations rarely result in penal action**, and most factories **resume operations without meaningful changes**. Eg: After the **Sattur explosion in 2025**, investigations began, but **no immediate enforcement action** was reported to prevent recurrence. ## **How does worker vulnerability worsen firecracker factory risks?** - **Social and Economic Marginalisation:** Workers are often from **poor, rural, and socially disadvantaged backgrounds**, making them **desperate for employment**, even in unsafe conditions. Eg: In **Virudhunagar**, many labourers accept jobs in hazardous fireworks units despite known safety risks due to **lack of alternative livelihood options**. - **Lack of Awareness and Training:** Vulnerable workers often have **low literacy levels** and receive **little or no safety training**, increasing the chance of **mishandling chemicals** or violating protocols. Eg: Many accidents occur during the **manual mixing or filling of chemicals**, which is often done by **untrained workers**. - **Weak Bargaining Power and Job Insecurity:** These workers usually work in **informal or unregistered setups**, where they **cannot demand better safety gear, facilities, or rights**. ## **What role should the state play in enforcing safety norms? (Way forward)** - **Strict Enforcement of Regulations:** Ensure **regular inspections** and **penalties for violations** under laws like the **Explosives Rules, 2008** and **Factories Act, 1948**. - **Collaboration with Industry for Safer Practices:** Work with manufacturers to **develop a culture of safety**, just as cooperation helped **eliminate child labour** in the past. - **Support for Worker Protection and Welfare:** Ensure **social security, compensation**, and **rehabilitation** for injured workers. Promote **formal employment practices**. ## **Mains PYQ:** **\\[UPSC 2015\\]** For achieving the desired objectives, it is necessary to ensure that the regulatory institutions remain independent and autonomous. Discuss in the light of the experiences in recent past. **Linkage:** _This question directly addresses the effectiveness of ‚Äúregulatory institutions‚Äù and their ability to achieve their ‚Äúdesired objectives‚Äù. The article explicitly state that the fireworks industry in Tamil Nadu, particularly in Virudhunagar, experiences numerous fatal accidents annually, despite being governed by the Explosives Rules, 2008, and requiring licenses from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization._ **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) ## **Why in the News?** The tragic **aircraft accident in Ahmedabad on June 12, 2025**, has once again thrown a spotlight on India‚Äôs deeply flawed **aviation accident investigation system**. ## **Why is the AAIB‚Äôs independence in question despite being a statutory body?** - **Operational Control by MoCA:** Although the AAIB is technically autonomous, it **functions under the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA)**, which also **regulates airlines through the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)**. **Eg**: In the **Air India AI171 crash (2025)**, both the investigation and regulation were under MoCA‚Äôs control, raising concerns of bias and lack of transparency. - **Leadership Appointments by the Same Authority:** The **MoCA appoints the heads** of both the **DGCA and the AAIB**, undermining the bureau‚Äôs credibility as an independent investigative body. **Eg**: This centralized appointment structure is unlike the **railway sector**, where investigations are done by the **Commissioner of Railway Safety**, independent of the Railway Ministry. - **Suppression of Uncomfortable Findings:** Independent reviews and reports exposing deeper faults are often **buried or ignored**. **Eg**: The **Air Marshal J.K. Seth Committee Report (1997)** identified serious aviation safety issues, but it was **never implemented** because it told inconvenient truths. ## **What systemic flaws affect India‚Äôs aviation safety framework?** - **Lack of Functional Independence in Investigations:** The **Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB)** operates under the same ministry (MoCA) that regulates the aviation sector, compromising neutrality. **Eg**: After the **Air India AI171 crash in June 2025**, concerns were raised that the investigation might not be impartial due to overlapping roles of MoCA and AAIB. - **Fragmented Oversight and Regulatory Capture:** Aviation oversight in India suffers from **poor coordination**, limited resources, and **influence by the very entities it is supposed to regulate**. **Eg**: The **J.K. Seth Committee Report (1997)** pointed out such flaws, including **regulatory capture**, yet its recommendations remain largely unimplemented. - **Reactive Rather Than Preventive Safety Culture:** India‚Äôs aviation safety system often **responds after accidents occur**, rather than identifying and mitigating risks in advance. **Eg**: Multiple **helicopter and flying school crashes** in 2024‚Äì25 were not adequately investigated for systemic lapses, highlighting the absence of a proactive safety mechanism. ## **How does MoCA‚Äôs control lead to conflict of interest in aviation oversight?** - **MoCA Controls Both Regulation and Investigation:** MoCA oversees the **Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)** and also controls the **Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB)**, creating an inherent **conflict** between promoting aviation and investigating its failures. **Eg**: In the **Air India AI171 crash (2025)**, MoCA was in charge of both regulating the airline and investigating the crash, raising doubts about impartiality. - **Lack of Independent Appointments:** Senior officials in both DGCA and AAIB are **appointed by MoCA**, making it difficult for these bodies to **act independently** or challenge government or airline lapses. **Eg**: The **J.K. Seth Committee (1997)** warned about lack of independence due to MoCA‚Äôs direct control over top appointments, yet no structural change followed. - **Investigative Findings May Be Influenced or Suppressed:** When the **regulator and investigator are under the same authority**, reports may be **watered down or delayed** to avoid political or bureaucratic accountability. **Eg**: The **Kozhikode crash (2020)** report‚Äôs recommendations were not fully implemented, with experts citing **MoCA‚Äôs influence** in diluting critical findings. ## **Why is pilot error often blamed in aviation accident reports?** - **Legally Convenient:** Blaming the pilot **simplifies legal liability** and expedites insurance claims, avoiding lengthy investigations or broader accountability. **Eg**: In many crash reports, including **Aurangabad crash (1993)**, pilot error was highlighted while structural or operational flaws were downplayed. - **Shields Other Stakeholders:** It **protects airlines, maintenance agencies, air traffic control**, and the regulator from scrutiny or punishment. **Eg**: In the **Air India Express IX611 case (2018)**, suspected overloading was ignored while responsibility was pushed toward the flight crew. - **Systemic Culture of Scapegoating:** There‚Äôs a **lack of a genuine no-blame culture** in India‚Äôs aviation safety framework. Pilots, even posthumously, become convenient scapegoats. **Eg**: After the **Kozhikode crash (2020)**, the pilot was quickly blamed, although systemic issues like runway design and poor weather protocols were also contributing factors. ## **Way forward:** - **Ensure Structural Independence of Investigative Bodies:** Transfer the **AAIB and DGCA** out of the Ministry of Civil Aviation‚Äôs direct control and make them **statutory authorities reporting to Parliament**. This will eliminate **conflict of interest** and promote **credible, impartial investigations**. - **Promote a No-Blame Safety Culture: Need to** amend existing rules to **prevent automatic criminal liability** for pilots unless gross negligence is proven (e.g., Rule 19(3) of Aircraft Rules, 1937). ## **Mains PYQ:** **\\[UPSC 2018\\]** Describe various measures taken in India for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) before and after signing ‚ÄòSendai Framework for DRR (2015-2030)‚Äô. How is this framework different from ‚ÄòHyogo Framework for Action, 2005? **Linkage:** _The article explicitly frames an aircraft accident as a ‚Äúwake-up call‚Äù and argues that India needs a system that ‚Äúprevents failures, and not just manages the damage.‚Äù It states, ‚ÄúWe cannot keep firefighting. We need a system that prevents failures‚Äù. This directly relates to the concept of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), which emphasises proactive measures and preparedness over reactive response._ **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) ## **Why in the News?** The container ship MSC Elsa 3 sank off the coast of Kochi on May 24, triggering a major environmental and maritime safety crisis that could turn into one of India‚Äôs worst maritime pollution disasters. ## **What led to the sinking of MSC Elsa 3?** - **Operational Failure at Sea:** On May 24, MSC Elsa 3 began tilting off the coast of Kochi due to an unspecified operational problem. Despite attempts by the crew, the ship could not be stabilised. - **Aging Vessel and Abandonment by Crew:** Although structurally considered safe, the ship was nearly 30 years old. The crew abandoned it after unsuccessful efforts to right it, leading to its eventual sinking. - **Unfavourable Sea Conditions:** Monsoon-related rough weather worsened the situation, with containers dislodging and floating, further destabilising the vessel before it sank to a depth of 50 metres. ## **Why are the sunken containers considered hazardous?** - **Reactive Chemicals:** Some containers hold substances that react dangerously with water, posing immediate chemical and fire hazards. **Eg:** 12 containers had **calcium carbide**, which reacts with seawater to produce **acetylene gas**, a highly flammable and explosive compound. - **Toxic Leakage:** Leaked substances from damaged containers can pollute seawater and pose health hazards to marine life and humans. **Eg:** A container with **rubber solution** leaked and reacted with seawater, leading to the appearance of **plastic pellets** along the Kerala coast. - **Long-Term Environmental Impact:** Chemicals from sunken containers can gradually seep out, causing persistent marine pollution and ecological damage. **Eg:** If not retrieved, chemicals from these containers may enter the **food chain**, harming marine biodiversity and impacting **fisheries**. | | | --- | | ## **Who handles oil spill response in India?** The **Indian Coast Guard** is the **nodal agency** under the **National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan (NOS-DCP)**. | ## **How does this incident test India‚Äôs maritime disaster readiness?** - **Inter-agency Coordination:** Effective disaster response requires smooth coordination between multiple agencies such as the Coast Guard, pollution control boards, and port authorities. **Eg:** In the 2017 Chennai oil spill, response was delayed due to **confusion and poor coordination**, leading to severe coastal damage. - **Emergency Response Infrastructure:** The ability to quickly deploy salvage teams, pollution control equipment, and monitoring systems is essential. **Eg:** After MSC Elsa 3 sank, authorities had **time to prepare**, making it a critical test of India‚Äôs **readiness to act swiftly** before oil or chemicals leak. - **Policy Implementation and Preparedness:** Real-time implementation of national plans and compliance with international protocols demonstrate operational strength. **Eg:** The National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan (NOS-DCP) designates the **Coast Guard as the nodal agency**, and this incident checks how well the plan is executed. | | | --- | | ## **What are the steps taken by the Indian Government?** - **Activation of Nodal Agencies:** The Indian Coast Guard has been designated as the nodal agency under the National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan (NOS-DCP) to coordinate the response. **Eg:** In the MSC Elsa 3 case, the Coast Guard is actively engaged in **monitoring oil leakage** and coordinating salvage efforts. - **Deployment of Salvage Operations:** Salvage teams are being engaged following international insurance protocols to prevent further environmental damage. **Eg:** Authorities have mobilised **professional salvers** to safely retrieve containers and prevent **hazardous leaks** from the sunken ship. - **Monitoring and Cleanup Measures:** Environmental agencies have been tasked with identifying and addressing the pollution caused, including plastic pellets and chemical residues. **Eg:** The Kerala government is coordinating with **central pollution control authorities** to manage the **shoreline impact** and protect marine life. | ## **Way forward:** - **Strengthen Maritime Hazard Protocols and Container Screening**: India must enforce stricter pre-shipment screening of cargo for hazardous materials and mandate real-time tracking of containers carrying reactive or toxic substances. - **Enhance Rapid Response Infrastructure and Inter-agency Coordination**: Develop a unified maritime disaster response framework with clearly defined roles for all agencies ‚Äî Coast Guard, pollution boards, port authorities, and state governments. ## **Mains PYQ:** **\\[UPSC 2022\\]** Discuss in detail the photochemical smog emphasizing its formation, effects and mitigation.

**Rise in Heat-related Illnesses and Deaths:** Extreme heat leads to heatstroke, dehydration, and worsens heart and kidney conditions. **Eg:** According to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), **over 25,000 heat-related deaths** were recorded in India between **1992 and 2020**. - **Overburdened Healthcare Infrastructure:** Hospitals face a surge in emergency cases during heatwaves, straining limited resources. **Eg:** During the **2022 heatwave**, Delhi‚Äôs Lok Nayak Hospital reported a **30% increase** in patients with heat-related symptoms in just a week. | ## **How does extreme heat act as a ‚Äúsocial injustice multiplier‚Äù?** - **Greater Risk to Vulnerable Populations:** Outdoor workers, elderly, and slum dwellers suffer disproportionately due to poor shelter and exposure. **Eg:** A study by the Indian Institute of Public Health (Ahmedabad) found **construction workers had a 2.5 times higher risk** of heat illness compared to the general population during peak summer. - **Limited adaptive capacity: Daily wage workers**, **street vendors**, and **waste pickers** cannot afford to stop working during heatwaves, making them more vulnerable to **heat stress** and illness. **Eg**: **Construction workers** under tin roofs suffer intense heat but have no choice but to continue working. - **Excludes the marginalised from public guidance:** Advice like ‚Äústay indoors‚Äù or ‚Äúavoid exertion‚Äù is often irrelevant to those who **lack shelter**, **depend on outdoor jobs**, or live in **overcrowded spaces**, highlighting deep **systemic inequalities**. **Eg**: A **homeless person** or a **street vendor** cannot follow ‚Äústay indoors‚Äù guidance during a red alert. ## **Who can act as frontline heat-safety champions?** - **ASHA Workers and Primary Health Workers:** Trained **Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs)** and staff at **Primary Health Centres (PHCs)** are well-placed to **spread awareness**, monitor **vulnerable groups**, and respond early to **heat-related illnesses**. **Eg**: An **ASHA worker** in a rural village sends **heat alerts** via WhatsApp and conducts **door-to-door visits** during a heatwave. - **Health and Wellness Centre Staff:** Staff at **Health and Wellness Centres** can play a key role in **educating communities**, distributing **hydration kits**, and advising on **preventive measures** like staying hydrated and avoiding midday sun. **Eg**: A **nurse** at a wellness centre trains local youth on recognizing **signs of heat stress** and first-aid response. | | | --- | | ## **What are the steps taken by the Indian Government?** - **Development of Heat Action Plans (HAPs):** The government, in collaboration with local bodies and NGOs, has promoted **city-level Heat Action Plans** to reduce **heat-related mortality** through **early warnings**, **public awareness**, and **cooling strategies**. **Eg**: The **Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan** (2013) includes **early warning systems**, **public cool spaces**, and **training for health workers**. - **Integration with Meteorological Services: India Meteorological Department (IMD)** provides **heat alerts**, which are increasingly being integrated into **local health response systems** to trigger preventive action. **Eg**: **Heat alerts** in Odisha are linked to **ASHA worker messaging** and **hydration kit distribution** before peak summer. - **Policy Push for Climate-Resilient Health Systems:** The **National Action Plan on Climate Change and Human Health (NAPCCHH)** encourages health systems to be **climate-ready** by building **infrastructure**, developing **clinical protocols**, and training staff. **Eg**: Health ministries now issue **advisories on heat stress**, including guidance on **modifying medication** for chronic patients during heatwaves. | ## **What preventive steps can make India‚Äôs health system heat-resilient? (Way forward)** - **Strengthening Primary Health Infrastructure:** Equip **primary health centres**, **Health & Wellness Centres**, and **ASHA workers** with **training and protocols** to identify and respond to heat-related illnesses. **Eg**: Trained **ASHA workers** in rural Gujarat conduct **door-to-door checks** during heat alerts and share **hydration tips** via WhatsApp groups. - **Integrating Heat Risk into Chronic Disease Care:** Clinicians should adjust **medications**, provide **heat safety counselling**, and track **high-risk patients** like those with heart or kidney conditions during summer. **Eg**: In Delhi, doctors monitor **diabetic patients** more closely during red alerts and advise them on **avoiding midday exposure**. -

**Notifications allowing industries to bypass prior environmental clearance:** The Court struck down two **Union Environment Ministry notifications** that permitted industrial units to **set up or expand operations without prior government approval**, violating the core principle of the **Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006**. _Eg:_ Industries were allowed to operate or change manufacturing practices without the mandatory **prior environmental clearance**. - **Regularisation of violations through executive orders without parliamentary approval:** The notifications enabled projects violating environmental laws to seek **regularisation by paying fines**, issued through **executive orders** instead of amending the **Environment Protection Act (EIA), 2006** via Parliament. _Eg:_ The 2017 ‚Äúone-time‚Äù window and 2021 standard operating procedure allowed violative industries to avoid penalties by applying for clearance retrospectively. | | | --- | | ## **Why did the Centre allow industries to bypass prior clearance?** - **One-time window for regularisation:** In 2017, the Centre provided a **‚Äúone-time‚Äù six-month window** for industries without proper environmental clearances to **apply retroactively**. - **Avoid disruption of economic activities:** The Centre wanted to prevent the **demolition of functioning plants** that contribute to the **economy and employment**, as shutting them down abruptly could be **disruptive**. - **Legal precedent for balanced approach:** The government cited **court rulings** supporting a **‚Äúbalanced‚Äù approach** in cases of violations, emphasizing **regularisation over punitive action** when feasible. - **Heavy fines as deterrent:** The 2021 standard operating procedure imposed **heavy fines** on violative projects applying for clearance, intending to **discourage violations** while still allowing formalisation. - **Procedural challenges with previous attempts:** Earlier attempts by the UPA government (2012-13) to regularise such projects were **struck down by courts on procedural grounds**, prompting the Centre to try **executive orders** as a workaround. _Eg:_ The **Jharkhand High Court** and **National Green Tribunal** nullified prior regularisation efforts due to procedural flaws. | ## **Who is impacted by the Court‚Äôs verdict?** - **Industries regularised under 2017 and 2021 orders remain unaffected:** Companies that used the **one-time window** or the **standard operating procedure** to **regularise violations** before the verdict will **not face penalties** due to the Court‚Äôs ruling. - **Future industrial projects must strictly follow prior clearance:** The verdict reaffirms that all new or expanding projects must obtain **mandatory prior environmental clearance**, impacting industries planning to start or modify operations. - **Regional environmental boards are under scrutiny:** The ruling highlights the **failure of local enforcement agencies** to prevent illegal operations, signaling the need for better **monitoring and compliance** at the regional level. _Eg:_ State pollution control boards will face greater pressure to enforce environmental laws rigorously. ## **Way forward:** - **Strengthen enforcement:** Empower and equip regional pollution control boards to rigorously monitor and ensure strict compliance with environmental clearance norms. - **Streamline clearance process:** Simplify and expedite the prior environmental clearance procedure to balance industrial growth with environmental protection, reducing incentives for violations. ## **Mains PYQ:** **\\[UPSC 2023\\]** The most significant achievement of modern law in India in the constitutionalization of environmental problems by the Supreme Court.

How is it determined? Describe various elements of a resilience framework. Also mention the global targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015- 2030). **Linkage:** _Heatwaves are increasingly recognized as severe weather events and fall under the purview of disaster management. This question directly asks about disaster resilience and its framework, which is crucial for tackling heatwaves. Building resilience to heatwaves involves both short-term preparedness (early warning systems, public awareness) and long-term adaptation (infrastructure changes, social safety nets) as highlighted in the article. The Sendai Framework‚Äôs targets are also relevant for setting goals in reducing heatwave-related mortality and morbidity._ | **_Mentor‚Äôs Comment:_** _According to the World Meteorological Organization, 2024 was the hottest year ever recorded, with global temperatures about 1.55¬∞C higher than in pre-industrial times. In India, December 2022 was the hottest December since temperature records began in 1901. Overall, India has seen more heatwaves in the last 20 years compared to the 20 years before that._ _Today‚Äôs editorial talks about the current heatwave situation and its effects. This topic is useful for GS Paper 3 in the UPSC Mains exam._ _\\__ _Let‚Äôs learn!_ ## **Why in the News?** On March 15, some states and cities in India faced their first severe heatwave of 2025 ‚Äî about 20 days earlier than the first severe heatwave in 2024. ## **What are the key health and socio-economic effects of heatwaves in India?** - **Health Impacts (Heat Stress)**: Heatwaves in India lead to heat stress, which occurs when the outside temperature approaches the body‚Äôs normal temperature of 37¬∞C. This hampers the body‚Äôs ability to release internal heat, leading to a range of health problems including kidney failure, liver damage, and brain-related issues, sometimes resulting in death. Eg, the 2015 heatwave in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana caused over 2,000 deaths due to extreme temperatures. - **Impact on Agriculture and Livestock**: Heatwaves negatively affect the farming sector, reducing crop yields and livestock production due to heat stress. Eg, the 2020 heatwaves led to significant crop damage, particularly in areas like Punjab and Haryana, where farmers saw a drop in wheat and paddy production, impacting food security. - **Socio-Economic Consequences**: Heatwaves result in loss of productivity, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like agriculture, construction, and outdoor work. This causes economic losses as workers lose work hours, and agricultural outputs decline. Eg, in 2023, heat stress led to an estimated loss of 6% of work hours in India, contributing to reduced personal incomes and affecting national GDP. ## **Why is heat stress an equity issue for vulnerable groups?** - **Disproportionate Impact on the Poor**: Vulnerable groups such as the poor face the worst effects of heat stress due to limited access to resources like cooling systems, healthcare, and safe working conditions. Eg, in urban slums with poor infrastructure, people are exposed to higher temperatures both indoors and outdoors, leading to greater health risks compared to wealthier populations with air-conditioned homes. - **Gendered Impact**: Women, especially in rural and lower-income areas, are more affected by heat stress due to cultural norms that restrict their mobility and tasks, such as working in kitchens or wearing heavy clothing. Eg, women in rural India may have to work in the kitchen during peak heat hours, further increasing their risk of heat-related illnesses. - **Impact on Migrant Workers and Informal Sector Employees**: Migrants and workers in the informal sector often lack access to benefits such as paid leave, healthcare, or workplace protections, making them more vulnerable to heat stress. Eg, construction workers in cities like Delhi and Mumbai suffer from heat-related illnesses as they work outdoors without proper protection, and they cannot afford to miss work, leading to further health deterioration. ## **When did India begin implementing Heat Action Plans (HAPs), and how have they evolved over the years?** - **Initial Implementation in 2013**: India began implementing Heat Action Plans (HAPs) in 2013 when Ahmedabad, Gujarat, became the first city in Asia to develop a municipal Heat Action Plan. The plan focused on early heatwave predictions, public awareness, and health system preparedness. Eg, Ahmedabad‚Äôs HAP helped reduce heat-related mortality by alerting vulnerable communities and healthcare systems ahead of heatwaves. - **Expansion to Other Cities (2014-2018)**: After the success in Ahmedabad, other cities and states began developing their own heat action plans. By 2018, over 20 Indian cities and states had implemented their HAPs, adapting them based on local vulnerabilities. Eg, cities like Chennai and Hyderabad incorporated heat action strategies, including cooling shelters and awareness campaigns. - **National Coordination (2018)**: In 2018, the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) was introduced to provide a unified approach, coordinating heat advisories and other health-related information across the country. Eg, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) began issuing nationwide heatwave alerts to help states and cities prepare for extreme heat events. - **Focus on Long-Term Measures (2020-Present)**: Recent iterations of HAPs have emphasized long-term preventive measures, such as urban greening, reflective rooftops, and improved building materials to reduce heat retention. Eg, several cities, like Delhi, are promoting cool roof policies, encouraging the use of heat-reflective materials on buildings to reduce urban heat islands. ## **How can India improve the effectiveness and implementation of Heat Action Plans at the state and city levels?** - **Tailor Plans Based on Local Vulnerability**: India can improve HAP effectiveness by ensuring that each state and city develops plans based on specific local vulnerabilities such as geography, socio-economic factors, and infrastructure. Eg, coastal cities like Mumbai may need strategies focusing on humidity and high temperatures, while inland cities like Jaipur might need to focus more on extreme heat and dry conditions. - **Incorporate Real-Time Data and Predictive Technology**: HAPs can be enhanced by using real-time data on temperature, humidity, and wind speed to improve forecasting accuracy and timely alerts. Eg, the use of satellite data and ground-based sensors in cities like Pune has allowed for more accurate predictions of heat stress, enabling better preparedness and quicker responses during heatwaves. - **Strengthen Collaboration Between Stakeholders**: Successful implementation of HAPs requires coordination between government bodies, local authorities, public health institutions, NGOs, and community organizations. Eg, in Ahmedabad, the city‚Äôs HAP involved collaborations between municipal authorities, public health officials, and non-governmental organizations, which significantly contributed to the reduction in heat-related deaths. - **Focus on Long-Term Urban Planning and Infrastructure**: HAPs should integrate long-term urban development strategies that mitigate heat in the built environment, such as increasing green spaces, promoting cool roofs, and using reflective materials for buildings. Eg, Chennai‚Äôs initiative to plant more trees and create shaded public spaces has helped reduce heat in urban areas, making the city more resilient to heatwaves. - **Ensure Inclusivity and Equity in Response Measures**: HAPs should ensure that vulnerable populations such as informal sector workers, elderly, and marginalized communities are given special attention during heatwaves. Eg, Delhi‚Äôs HAP has included mobile cooling units and shelters for the homeless, along with providing water points and health services in areas with high concentrations of migrant workers and low-income groups. | | | --- | | ## **What is the current situation regarding the occurrence of heat waves in India?** - **Increased Frequency of Heatwave Days**: The number of heatwave days in India has risen over the past decade. In 2022, approximately 121 heatwave days were recorded across the country, a decrease from the previous year but still indicative of a growing trend. - **Record-Breaking Temperatures**: In May 2024, northern India experienced severe heatwaves, with temperatures reaching up to 49.1¬∞C in New Delhi. Over 37 cities reported temperatures exceeding 45¬∞C, leading to at least 56 confirmed deaths and 25,000 suspected cases of heatstroke. - **Projections of Future Heatwave Intensification**: Future projections indicate a significant increase in heatwave frequency due to climate change. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the frequency of heatwaves in India is expected to increase by a factor of 4 to 7 in the mid-term and by 5 to 10 times in the long-term future. | ## **Way forward:** - **Strengthen Policy Integration and Local Capacities:** Integrate Heat Action Plans into urban planning and disaster management policies, while building capacity at local levels for climate-resilient infrastructure and real-time response systems. - **Targeted Support for Vulnerable Groups:** Prioritize inclusive measures such as community cooling centers, mobile health units, and social safety nets to protect informal workers, elderly, and low-income populations from heat-related risks. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Mains level:** Natural disaster; ## **Why in the News?** Earlier this week, the **_Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police_** rescued 23 workers trapped under snow and ice after an avalanche in Mana village, Uttarakhand. ## **What were the key challenges faced by the rescue teams during the avalanche operation in Mana Village?** - **Harsh Weather Conditions:** The rescue teams operated under heavy snowfall and extreme cold at an elevation of 10,500 feet above mean sea level. - **Blocked Access Routes:** Snow-blocked roads required the use of helicopters for evacuation, complicating logistics and delaying rescue efforts. - **Physical Exhaustion:** Rescuers worked in near-continuous 60-hour shifts, demanding immense physical and mental stamina. - **Buried Structures:** Containers housing workers were buried under several feet of snow, ice, and rock, making detection and extraction challenging. - **Limited Visibility and Navigation:** Poor weather conditions hindered visibility, requiring the use of advanced technology like drone-based detection systems. ## **Why is Mana village particularly vulnerable to avalanches and other natural disasters?** - **High-Altitude Location:** Situated at 10,500 feet above sea level in the upper Himalayas, the village experiences heavy snowfall and extreme weather, increasing the risk of avalanches. _Example:_ The recent avalanche buried containers under several feet of snow, making rescue operations challenging. - **Geological Instability:** The Himalayan region is tectonically active, making the terrain prone to landslides, avalanches, and other natural hazards. _Example:_ Frequent landslides during the monsoon season disrupt roads and infrastructure in Uttarakhand. - **Seasonal Climate Extremes:** Harsh winters with severe snow accumulation create unstable snowpacks that can trigger avalanches. _Example:_ Villagers traditionally migrate to lower areas like Gopeshwar during winter to avoid extreme weather risks. - **Construction and Human Activity:** Ongoing infrastructure projects, such as road-building by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), disturb the fragile environment and increase disaster risks. _Example:_ Workers were caught in an avalanche while working on a BRO construction site. - **Proximity to Glacial Zones:** Close to glacial areas where melting ice and shifting snowpacks heighten the probability of snow slides. _Example:_ Melting glaciers in the region have previously triggered flash floods, like the 2021 Chamoli disaster. ## **What lessons can be learned from other hazardous environments?** - **Enhanced Shelter Design for Safety:** Use reinforced, insulated shelters designed to withstand extreme weather and heavy snow loads, similar to Antarctic research stations. _Example:_ Antarctic research bases like the Amundsen-Scott Station use elevated, modular designs to prevent snow burial and provide long-term safety. - **Advanced Early Warning Systems:** Implement real-time monitoring using satellite imaging, drones, and weather forecasting to detect potential avalanches and other hazards. _Example:_ Switzerland‚Äôs avalanche warning system uses advanced sensors and weather models to alert communities and workers in mountainous areas. - **Comprehensive Safety Protocols and Training:** Provide specialized safety training, emergency drills, and evacuation plans to workers in high-risk zones. _Example:_ Oil platforms in the Arctic conduct regular safety drills and have rapid-response systems for extreme weather emergencies. ## **How could better infrastructure and safety measures reduce the risks faced by workers in high-altitude, disaster-prone areas? (Way forward)** - **Improved Worker Shelters and Living Conditions:** Construct insulated, avalanche-resistant shelters with emergency exits and heating systems to protect workers from harsh weather. _Example:_ The Siachen Glacier military base uses reinforced prefabricated shelters designed to withstand extreme snow and sub-zero temperatures. - **Deployment of Real-Time Monitoring and Early Warning Systems:** Use geospatial technology, drones, and automated weather stations to track snow accumulation and predict avalanches. _Example:_ Japan‚Äôs snow monitoring system uses remote sensors to provide early warnings, reducing avalanche risks in mountainous areas. - **Enhanced Emergency Response Infrastructure:** Establish permanent rescue facilities with specialized equipment (e.g., thermal detectors and rapid evacuation routes) for quicker disaster response. _Example:_ The Alps region in Europe maintains well-equipped avalanche rescue stations, ensuring faster response times and reducing casualties. ## **Mains PYQ:** **Q** Differentiate the causes of landslides in the Himalayan region and Western Ghats. **(UPSC IAS/2021)** **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Mains level:** Crowd Management; ## **Why in the News?** This week in India, a tragic crowd crush at the Maha Kumbh claimed the lives of 30 people. ## **What scientific evidence supports the prevention of crowd disasters?** - **Crowd Density Studies:** Research indicates that crowd crushes become dangerous at densities of five persons per square meter, with serious risks emerging at seven persons per square meter or more. This evidence underscores the need for effective crowd management to prevent dangerous overcrowding. - **Predictability of Crowd Behavior:** Scientific studies have shown that crowd dynamics can be predicted and managed. By understanding how crowds behave in different environments, planners can implement strategies to avoid conditions that lead to crushes. - **Historical Data on Past Incidents:** Analysis of previous crowd disasters reveals common factors leading to fatalities, such as inadequate space and poor crowd control measures. Lessons learned from these incidents can inform better practices for future events. ## **How can effective crowd management practices be implemented at large events?** - **Strategic Planning:** Event organizers should create a comprehensive plan that includes crowd flow evaluation, risk assessment, and clearly marked exits and entrances. This planning should involve local officials to ensure safety measures are adequate. - **Staggered Entry and Exit Times:** To reduce peak crowd density, organizers can stagger arrival and departure times for attendees, allowing for a more manageable flow of people into and out of the venue. - **Use of Barriers:** Implementing physical barriers can help segment crowds into smaller groups, reducing the likelihood of dangerous surges. Barriers should be designed to allow for emergency exits if needed. - **Crowd Monitoring Systems:** Utilizing technology for real-time monitoring of crowd density and behaviour can help event staff respond quickly to potential dangers. Mass notification systems can alert staff about growing concerns, enabling timely interventions. - **Staff Training and Communication:** Ensuring that all staff and security personnel are trained in crowd management techniques is essential. Clear communication protocols should be established to relay information quickly during an event. ## **What role do policies and regulations play in enhancing crowd safety?** - **Mandatory Safety Regulations:** Governments should introduce regulations requiring event organizers to adhere to safety standards that limit crowd density and ensure adequate emergency planning. Such policies can hold organizers accountable for crowd safety. - **Economic Incentives for Compliance:** While event organizers often prioritize profit over safety, regulations can create incentives for them to implement safer practices, such as limiting ticket sales based on venue capacity. - **Post-Incident Reviews and Accountability:** Establishing a framework for reviewing crowd disasters can lead to improved regulations and practices in the future.

They were not seen as exceptional or unusual disasters warranting specific disaster management provisions under the DM Act, 2005. - **Perception of Predictability:** Unlike sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes or cyclones, heatwaves were perceived as relatively predictable and part of seasonal weather patterns. This perception led to a belief that they could be managed through general public awareness and local interventions rather than formal disaster response mechanisms. - **Not fit in definition of Disaster:** When the DM Act was formulated, disasters were defined as events that caused substantial loss of life, property, or environmental damage beyond the coping capacity of the affected community. At that time, the impacts of heatwaves were typically viewed as localized health issues rather than widespread disasters. - **Lack of Urgency**: There was a lack of urgency in recognizing heatwaves as disasters requiring national-level response frameworks. The focus of disaster management efforts initially leaned towards more acute and visible calamities like cyclones, floods, and earthquakes. ## **Why is the Centre Not Adding Heatwaves as a Notified Disaster Now?** - **Financial Concerns:** One of the primary concerns is the potential financial burden of declaring heat waves as a notified disaster. Under the current provisions, the government is obligated to provide monetary compensation for lives lost during notified disasters, which is set at Rs 4 lakh per victim. - **The reluctance of Finance Commissions:** Despite requests from various states, the 15th Finance Commission has not recommended adding heatwaves to the list of notified disasters. They argue that the existing categories adequately cover disaster response needs, and they have provided provisions for states to utilize a portion of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for local disasters like heatwaves. **Conclusion:** Engage with the Finance Commission and other relevant bodies to reassess the inclusion of heatwaves as a notified disaster. Highlight the evolving nature of heat waves, their increasing frequency, and the need for dedicated funding and support mechanisms. ## **Mains PYQ:** **Q** Climate change‚Äô is a global problem.

Patterns in disaster data reveal factors such as increased resilience, climate change, and improved humanitarian response. - **Improved Reporting**: Reporting of small events, particularly those with fewer than 200 deaths, has increased significantly since the 1980s and 1990s. Historical data mainly included major events due to limited interest and capacity for data collection in earlier periods. ## **Missing Data and Limitations of Disaster Databases** - **Biases and Gaps in Historical Records:** Earlier records predominantly captured major disasters, with smaller events often missing. Data coverage is particularly poor in low-income regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where economic losses from disasters are frequently underreported. - **Missing Economic Damage and Insured Losses:** More than 40% of disasters between 1990 and 2020 lacked estimates of monetary damages. Insured damages were missing in 88% of disaster reports, and 96% needed records of reconstruction costs. - **No coverage of Heat Events and Health Impacts:** Reporting of heat events is concentrated in a few countries, suggesting underreporting in other regions. Indirect health effects of extreme temperatures, such as increased cardiovascular disease risk, are challenging to quantify and often underestimated. ## **Need for Data (Way Forward)** - **Improving Data Coverage:** Enhanced data collection in low-income regions and better integration of smaller events into disaster databases are crucial. - **Accurate Health Impact Quantification:** Improved methods for estimating indirect health effects of extreme temperatures and other disaster-related conditions are needed. Utilising statistical methods to capture the broader health impacts of disasters can aid in better policy formulation. - **Policy and Resilience Planning:** Reliable and comprehensive disaster data are essential for effective policy-making and resilience planning. Data-driven insights and predictive analytics can help foresee the long-term impacts of disasters and guide regulatory measures to enhance disaster preparedness and response. ## **Mains PYQ:** **Q** Discuss the recent measures initiated in disaster management by the Government of India departing from the earlier reactive approach. **(UPSC IAS/2020)** **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI) report **Mains level:** Laws and guidelines for fire safety in buildings; ## **Why in the News?** Recent fire tragedies at a **_Rajkot gaming zone_** and a **_Delhi children‚Äôs hospital_** that killed 40 people highlight the urgent need for stricter fire safety enforcement. | | | --- | | ## **According to the latest Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI) report** - It was released by the ‚Äú **_National Crimes Records Bureau (NCRB)‚Äù_** - In 2022, 7,435 people died in over 7,500 fire accidents. This data shows that heavy casualties from fire accidents persist, with no lessons learned from the **_1997 Uphaar Cinema tragedy_** or the **_2004 Kumbakonam fire_** that killed 90 schoolchildren. | ## **What are the various laws and guidelines which stipulate rules around fire safety in buildings?** - **National Building Code (NBC):** Published by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in 1970, last updated in 2016. - Part 4 of NBC is about the details of fire safety measures, including construction guidelines, materials, and safety protocols. They are mandatory for states to incorporate NBC recommendations into local buildings. - **Model Building Bye Laws 2016**: It is issued by the **_Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs_**. It guides States/UTs in framing building bylaws with norms for fire protection and safety. - **State Fire Services Act:** Fire services are a state subject, and individual states have their own Fire Services Acts or building bylaws. - **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Guidelines:** Provide fire safety instructions for homes, schools, and hospitals. Include recommendations on maintaining safety spaces, exit mechanisms, dedicated staircases, and evacuation drills. | | | --- | | ## **Key Points from Fire Safety Regulations by Government:** - **Building Classification:** Buildings are classified based on occupancy (e.g., Residential, Institutional, Assembly). Specific measures for high-rise buildings, educational institutes, hotels, etc. - **Construction Material:** Use of non-combustible materials. Internal walls of staircases should have a minimum 120-minute fire rating. - **Electrical Safety:** Flame retardant wiring and cabling.

This was strongest in last 25 years. ## **Reason behind the earthquake in Taiwan** - In the Taiwan region, the Philippine Sea plate is moving northwest towards the Eurasian plate at a velocity of about 7.8 cm per year, which is faster than the motion of the Indian plate. - Lying 160 km off the coast of China, Taiwan was formed at a convergent boundary of the Philippine and Eurasian plates in the western Pacific Ocean. It is a country of strong earthquakes. ## **Why other countries should take lesson from Taiwan in quake resilience?** - **In 1999,** the Chi-Chi earthquake of magnitude 7.7 occurred in the central part of Taiwan and impacted the western region. It killed more than **_2,430 people and left 11,305 wounded._** It caused more than 50,000 buildings to collapse and partially damaged as many. - **In 2024**, Hualien earthquake killed at least **_13 people and injured about 1,000_**. Most of the deaths were caused by earthquake-triggered rockfalls and not by toppled buildings. Despite being of nearly **_comparable magnitude_**, the 2024 earthquake has caused minimal damage compared to the 1999 earthquake. ## **Taiwan‚Äôs earthquake preparedness** - **Advanced Monitoring and Early Warning Systems:** Taiwan boasts the most advanced earthquake-monitoring network and early warning systems, allowing for quick detection and alerting of seismic activity. - **Public Awareness Campaigns and Drills:** Widespread awareness campaigns and regular drills on earthquake safety have significantly improved the public‚Äôs understanding of earthquake risks and proper safety protocols. - **Government Regulations and Incentives:** The government constantly updates earthquake safety requirements for both new and existing buildings. Additionally, incentives such as subsidies are offered to residents to improve the quake resistance of buildings, encouraging compliance with safety standards. - **Scientific Judgments for Seismic Risk:** Utilizing knowledge of earthquake frequency and severity in different areas, Taiwan is able to make sound scientific judgments regarding seismic risk. - **Utilization of New Technologies:** Taiwan employs cutting-edge technologies such as **_seismic dampers_** and base isolation systems to enhance building resilience. For example, Taipei 101, the nation‚Äôs iconic building, features a tuned mass damper‚Äîa massive steel sphere suspended by cables within the tower‚Äîwhich acts as a pendulum to counteract building motion during earthquakes. ## **What India can learn from Taiwan?** - **Importance of Seismic Safety Regulations:** India, especially in tectonically unstable regions like the Himalayas, must prioritize seismic safety regulations in all infrastructure projects. - **Customized Seismic Codes:** Similar to Taiwan, India should develop seismic codes tailored to specific regions based on local earthquake activity, building types, and construction materials. These customized codes can better address the unique seismic risks faced by different parts of the country. - **Utilization of Traditional Architectural Styles:** In some parts of India, traditional architectural styles may possess inherent earthquake resistivity. By rediscovering and encouraging the use of these traditional techniques, India can promote earthquake-resistant building practices that are culturally and environmentally sustainable. - **Integration of Seismic Zonation Maps:** Indian code IS 1893 already specifies seismic designs based on seismic zonation maps. It‚Äôs crucial for India to integrate these maps effectively into urban planning and construction practices to ensure that buildings are designed and located in accordance with seismic risk assessments. ## **Conclusion** Earthquakes is natural disasters with unpredictable occurrences, can have devastating effects on society. However, their impact can be mitigated through preventive measures such as early warning systems, construction regulations, and raising awareness about earthquake preparedness. **Mains PYQ** **Q** Discuss about the vulnerability of India to earthquake related hazards.

This involves securing financial support for infrastructure upgrades, research and development, capacity building, and community resilience programs. ## **Conclusion** - It is imperative for India to recognize flood flows as a valuable resource and implement measures that conserve water for subsequent use and water security. By adopting a comprehensive approach, upgrading hydro-infrastructure, and leveraging a mix of structural and non-structural measures, India can effectively mitigate the impacts of floods while ensuring sustainable water management for the future.

Inter-cloud 2. Intra-cloud 3. Cloud-to-ground - It is the cloud-to-ground form of lightning that kills humans, as well as animals and livestock, and can substantially damage property. - While the Earth is a good conductor of electricity, it is electrically neutral. - However, in comparison to the middle layer of the cloud, it becomes positively charged. - As a result, about 15%-20% of the current gets directed towards the Earth as well. - It is this flow of current that results in damage to life and property on Earth. ## **How intensely does it strike?** - A typical lightning flash is about **300 million volts** and **30,000 amps**. - To put it in perspective, household current is 120 volts and 15 amps. - A flash of lightning is enough to light a 100-watt incandescent bulb for about three months. ## **Why does lightning kill so many people in India?** - The reason for the high number of deaths is due to people being caught unawares and more than 70% of fatalities happened due to people standing under isolated tall trees. - About 25 per cent of the people were struck in the open. - Also, lightning is the direct promulgation of climate change extremities. ## **Mitigating lightning incidents** - Lightning is not classified as a natural disaster in India. - But recent efforts have resulted in the setting up of an early warning system that is already saving many lives. - More than 96% of lightning deaths happen in rural areas. - As such, most of the mitigation and public awareness programmes need to focus on these communities. - Lightning protection devices are fairly unsophisticated and low-cost. Yet, their deployment in the rural areas, as of now, is extremely low. - States are being encouraged to prepare and implement lightning action plans, on the lines of heat action plans. - An international centre for excellence on lightning research to boost detection and early warning systems is also in the process of being set up. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Landslide Atlas of Indi **Mains level:** Heavt rain induced disasters The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) recently released the Landslide Atlas of India to identify landslide hotspots in the country. ## **What are Landslides?** - Landslides are natural disasters that occur in mountainous terrains where soil, rock, geology, and slope conditions are conducive. - A landslide is the sudden movement of rock, boulders, earth, or debris down a slope. - They can be triggered by natural causes such as heavy rainfall, earthquakes, snowmelting, and undercutting of slopes due to flooding. - They are extremely hazardous, posing a threat to human and animal lives, damaging property, roads, and bridges, disrupting communication lines, and snapping power lines. - Landslides are broadly classified based on the type of materials involved, the type of movement of the material, and the type of flow of the material. **Why do they occur?** - Landslides are natural disasters that occur mainly in mountainous terrains due to conducive conditions of soil, rock, geology, and slope. - Heavy rainfall, earthquakes, snow-melting, and undercutting of slopes due to flooding can trigger landslides. - Anthropogenic activities such as excavation, cutting of hills and trees, excessive infrastructure development, and overgrazing by cattle can also cause landslides. ## **Factors contributing** - The main factors that influence landslides include lithology, geological structures like faults, hill slopes, drainage, geomorphology, land use and land cover, soil texture and depth, and weathering of rocks. - Rainfall variability pattern is the single biggest cause for landslides in India, with the Himalayas and the Western Ghats remaining highly vulnerable. ## **India‚Äôs vulnerability to landslides** - India is considered among the top five landslide-prone countries globally, where at least one death per 100 sq. km is reported in a year due to a landslide event. - Approximately 12.6% of the country‚Äôs geographical land area (0.42 million sq km) is prone to landslides, with 66.5% of landslides reported from the North-western Himalayas, 18.8% from the North-eastern Himalayas, and 14.7% from the Western Ghats. ## **Risks in specific states** - Mizoram recorded the highest number of landslide events in the past 25 years, with 12,385 events, of which 8,926 were recorded in 2017 alone. - Nagaland and Manipur also reported a high number of landslide events during the 2017 monsoon season. - Uttarakhand and Kerala reported the highest number of landslides, with Uttarakhand experiencing 11,219 events since 1998, and Kerala making inhabitants significantly vulnerable to fatalities, despite fewer events. ## **Classification and Mapping of Landslides** - Landslides are broadly classified based on the type of materials involved, type of movement, type of flow of the material, and whether they spread laterally. - The Landslide Atlas of India maps landslides mainly based on events and seasons. - The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) used a landslide database created from 1998 to 2022 using aerial and high-resolution satellite images. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Earthquakes, India's earthquake prone regions **Mains level:** India's policy on Earthquake preparedness ## **Central Idea** - The destruction caused by earthquakes in Turkey should be alarming for India. Over the last three weeks, tremors have been felt in Himalayan states. Moreover, geologists have warned of a probable massive earthquake in the Himalayan state. In this context the Delhi High Court asked the state government to file a status report and action plan on the structural safety of buildings in Delhi. Nearly 58 per cent of the Indian landmass is vulnerable to earthquakes and the concerns that have been raised by the court need a policy response instead.

It ignores the buildings that were constructed before such codes were published in 1962. Such buildings form a large part of our cities. 2. It assumes infallibility in the processes of enforcement, relying only on penalisation and illegalities. 3. It treats earthquakes as a problem of individual buildings, as if they exist and behave in complete isolation from their urban context. ## **What needs to be done?** - **Preparedness at Building and City Scale through policy:** Earthquake preparedness, therefore, needs to act at the scale of building details as well as that of cities. Moreover, we must think about it in the realm of policy and not just legal enforcement. - **Need for Comprehensive Policy:** At the scale of building details, we need to create a system of retrofitting existing structures and enforcing seismic codes with more efficiency. While there has been political talk and piecemeal efforts towards retrofitting, we still lack a comprehensive policy. ## **A policy should include two measures** 1. **Retrofitting Buildings to Seismic Codes:** - To create a system of tax-based or development rights-based incentives for retrofitting one‚Äôs building up to seismic codes. - Such a system of incentives will enable the growth of an industry around retrofitting and will generate a body of well-trained professionals and competent organisations. 1. **Improving Seismic Code Enforcement:** - By ensuring better enforcement of seismic codes through a similar model. A step forward in this direction was the National Retrofitting Programme launched in 2014. - Under the programme, the Reserve Bank of India directed banks to deny loans for any building activity that does not meet the standards of earthquake-resistant design. ## **_Case study: Japan_** - Japan has invested heavily in technological measures to mitigate the damage from the frequent earthquakes that it experiences. - Skyscrapers are built with counterweights and other high-tech provisions to minimise the impact of tremors. - Small houses are built on flexible foundations and public infrastructure is integrated with automated triggers that cut power, gas, and water lines during earthquakes. - All of this has been a result of cultivating an industry around earthquake mitigation and fostering expertise. ## **Criteria for an urban-level policy to generate earthquake vulnerability maps** 1. The percentage of vulnerable structures in the area; 2. The availability of evacuation routes and distances from the nearest open ground; 3. Density of the urban fabric; 4. Location of nearest relief services and the efficiency with which these services can reach affected sites. - **For example:** Flood zone mapping is a good example of such an exercise that has proven to be successful in terms of timely evacuation and efficient implementation. ## **Conclusion** - Governments and policymakers ought to know better than act in a piecemeal manner. Programmes like the ongoing Urban 20 meetings are an excellent opportunity for international knowledge exchange on earthquake preparedness. The Delhi High Court‚Äôs directions must act as a reminder for the inclusion of an earthquake preparedness policy in urban renewal programmes such as the Smart Cities Mission. A policy on earthquake preparedness requires a visionary, radical and transformative approach. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates **Mains level:** Read the attached story More than 4000 people died and several hundred were injured after a major earthquake of magnitude 7.8 hit south-central Turkey and Northwest Syria. ## **What is an Earthquake?** - An earthquake is an intense shaking of the ground caused by movement under the earth‚Äôs surface. - It happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. - This releases stored-up ‚Äòelastic strain‚Äô energy in the form of seismic waves, which spreads through the earth and cause the shaking of the ground. ## **What exactly causes Earthquakes?** - As we know, the earth‚Äôs outermost surface, crust, is fragmented into **tectonic plates**. - The edges of the plates are called **plate boundaries**, which are made up of faults. - The tectonic plates constantly move at a slow pace, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. - As the edges of the plates are quite rough, they get stuck with one another while the rest of the plate keeps moving. - Earthquake occurs when the plate has moved far enough and the edges unstick on one of the faults. - The location below the earth‚Äôs surface where the earthquake starts is called the **hypocenter**, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the **epicentre**. ## **How prone is Turkey to Earthquakes?** - Turkey and Syria lie in a seismically active region - The region where the earthquake has struck lies along a well-known seismic fault line called the Anatolia tectonic block that runs through northern, central, and eastern Turkey. - It is a seismically active zone ‚Äî though not as active as, say, the Himalayan region which is one of the most dangerous regions in the world from the perspective of earthquakes. ## **What makes Turkey a hotbed of seismic activity?** - Turkey is frequently shaken by earthquakes. In 2020 itself, it recorded almost 33,000 earthquakes in the region. - Turkey is located on the **Anatolian tectonic plate**, which is wedged between the Eurasian and African plates. - On the north side, the minor Arabian plate further restricts movement. - One fault line ‚Äî the **North Anatolian fault (NAF) line**, the meeting point of the Eurasian and Anatolian tectonic plates ‚Äî is known to be ‚Äúparticularly devastating‚Äù. - Then there is the **East Anatolian fault line**, the tectonic boundary between the Anatolian Plate and the northward-moving Arabian Plate. - It runs 650 kilometers from eastern Turkey and into the Mediterranean. - In addition to this, the **Aegean Sea Plate**, located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea under southern Greece and western Turkey, is also a source of seismic activity in the region. **Where was the earthquake epicentered?** - The centre of the earthquake was centred about 33 km from Gaziantep, around 18 km deep. - Its effect was felt across West Asia, Northern Africa and South Eastern Europe with residents of Lebanon, Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Egypt also reporting tremors. **Aftermath: Many Aftershocks hits the region** - Aftershocks are a sequence of earthquakes that happen after a larger mainshock on a fault. - Aftershocks occur near the fault zone where the mainshock rupture occurred and are part of the ‚Äúreadjustment process‚Äù after the main slip on the fault. - While they become less frequent with time, although they can continue for days, weeks, months, or even years for a very large mainshock. ## **Can earthquakes be predicted?** - An accurate prediction of an earthquake requires some sort of a precursory signal from within the earth that indicates a big quake is on the way. - Moreover, the signal must occur only before large earthquakes so that it doesn‚Äôt indicate every small movement within the earth‚Äôs surface. - Currently, there is no equipment to find such precursors, even if they exist. ## **India offers assistance** - India is among the 45 countries, which have so far offered assistance to Turkey. - It‚Äôs sending search and rescue teams of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and medical teams along with relief material to the West Asian nation. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** EIA **Mains level:** Read the attached story The Supreme Court has urged legislators and policy experts to ensure that Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) studies are done before giving the green signal for urban development projects in India‚Äôs cities. ## **What is the news?** - The Supreme Court how haphazard urban development has ruined the ‚ÄòGarden City‚Äô of Bengaluru as witnessed during a major spell of rain in September 2022. - The court said that the city struggled for drinking water while it lay submerged after the downpour. Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) defines it as, _a formal process to predict the environmental consequences of human development activities and to plan appropriate measures to eliminate or reduce adverse effects and to augment positive effects._ - Thus, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is an integral part of Environmental Management. It investigates likely impacts, both positive and negative, of development projects on the surrounding environment. - Simply put, EIA is a detailed study regarding the impacts of any project on the environment. It serves as a decision-making tool which helps policy makers approve, reject or find an alternative to a project In India, Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is notified under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986. ## **Evolution of EIA** - The origin of EIA lies in the enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA) in the year 1969 in the USA. It not only introduced the concept of environmental impact assessment but also made it necessary for federal agencies to evaluate impact of environmental decisions. - Environment Impact Assessment gained popularity after the introduction of the concept of sustainable developmentvia World Commission on Environment 1987 & United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Rio Summit) in 1992. It led to adoption of EIA in many countries as well. Principle 17 of the Rio Summit states that, - _[Environmental impact assessment](https://blog.forumias.com/answered-what-are-main-principles-of-environment-impact-assessment-discuss-the-significance-of-environment-impact-assessment-in-various-development-projects/) (EIA), as a national instrument, shall be undertaken for proposed activities that are likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and are subject to a decision of a competent national authority_. _\\[_ _Given just for your info. No need to remember this type of complex language.Instead, you can mention that **EIA is mentioned explicitly under Principle 17 of the Rio declaration of 1992\\].**_ - In 1976-77, EIA was started in India, when the Department of Science and Technology was asked by Planning Commission to examine the river-valley projects from the environmental angle. - Eventually n 1994, EIA was made mandatory in India under the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986. Until then, environmental clearance from the Central Government was an administrative decision and had no legislative backing. - Since then, EIA has been amended several times. The most significant amendment was made in 2006 #### **EIA Process** Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) process can vary depending on a country‚Äôs policy and requirement. However, EIA process in most countries, including India, have the following steps: 1. Screening 2. Scoping 3. Collection of baseline data 4. Impact Prediction 5. Assessment of alternatives, mitigation measures & Environmental, Impact Assessment Report 6. Public Hearing 7. Decision Making 8. Monitoring the clearance conditions **Screening**: This is the first step in the EIA process. At this stage it is decided whether the proposed project needs an EIA and if so to what detail. Screening criteria are based upon: - Scales of investment - Type of development - Location of development **Scoping**: It is the most significant step in the entire EIA process as key environmental issues involved are identified at this stage. - Scoping has to be done by consultants in consultation with the project proponent and guidance, if needed, from Impact Assessment Agency - The Ministry of Environment and Forests has published sector-wise guidelines which outline the significant issues which have to be addressed while conducting the EIA studies. - At the end of scoping, detailed terms of reference (TOR) are prepared of EIA. - TOR is a written document containing written requirements governing EIA implementation, consultations to be held, data to be gathered, methodology to be used etc **Collection of baseline data**: It describes the existing environmental status of the identified study area. The site-specific primary data is monitored and supplemented with secondary data **Impact prediction**: Under this, possible effects on the physical, biological, social and economic conditions are taken into consideration and measures are suggested to prevent, reduce or compensate for the impacts. **For example:** - Impact of biological diversity in an area ex. EIA done by Gadgil panel on the western ghats regions. - Impact on habitat because of deforestation and pollution- Impact on Himalayan ecosystem when hydropower projects are opened. - Impact on endangered animals and migratory paths. For ex Great India hornbill‚Äôs trail in India is evaluated so as to see that such developmental project is not affecting its pathway. - The predictions of impact can never be absolute and certain and thus there is a need to comprehensively consider all factors and take all possible precautions for reducing the degree of uncertainty. **Assessment of alternatives, mitigation measures & Environmental Impact Assessment Report: Identification of alternatives and their comparison**: For every project, possible alternatives are to be identified and environmental impacts and benefits to be compared. - Alternatives should then be ranked for selection of the best environmental option for optimum economic benefits to the community at large. - **Environment Management Plan (EMP)**: Once alternatives have been reviewed, an impact mitigation plan is drawn up for the selected option and is supplemented with an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to guide the proponent towards environmental improvements. EMP is a crucial input to monitoring the clearance conditions and therefore details of monitoring should be included in it. - EMP is a site-specific plan developed to ensure that the project is implemented in an environmentally sustainable manner where all contractors and subcontractors, including consultants understand the potential environmental risks arising from the project and take appropriate actions to properly manage that risk. - An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report prepared at this stage should provide clear information to the decision maker on the different environmental scenarios without the project, with the project and with project alternatives. **Public Hearing**: Public must be informed and consulted on a proposed development after the completion of EIA report - Gram Sabha must be consulted before the project starts. Gram Sabha means the electorate (people eligible to vote) of the region **Decision-making**: It involves consultations between the project proponent (assisted by a consultant) and the impact assessment authority (assisted by an expert group if necessary). Final decision regarding the project is taken, keeping in mind EIA and EMP (Environment Management Plan). **Monitoring**: Monitoring should be done during both construction and operation phases of a project. This is not only to ensure that the commitments made are complied with but also to observe whether the predictions made in the EIA reports were correct or not. - Where the impacts exceed the predicted levels, corrective action should be taken. - Monitoring enables the regulatory agency to review the validity of predictions and the conditions of implementation of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). ## **Objective of EIA** - To bring out a national policy to encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and environment. - To promote efforts to prevent or eliminate damage to the environment. - To increase understanding of ecological systems and natural resources important to the nation ## **Why we need Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)? / Significance of EIA / Benefits of EIA** - **Facilitates sustainable development**: In present times anthropogenic activities like rapid industrialization, mass production and clearing of forests have created immense pressure on the natural environment. Tools like EIA help in balancing the need for economic growth with equally important concept of sustainability. - **Mitigating negative impacts & informed decision-making**‚Äì Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) helps in minimizing the negative impact of various development projects. It enables monitoring programmes to be established to assess future impacts and provide data on which managers can take informed decisions to avoid environmental damage. - **Aids cost-effectiveness**‚Äì EIA helps in selection and design of projects, programmes or plans with long term viability and therefore improves cost effectiveness. - Advance assessments also helps avoid future losses that may be incurred if the project is found environmentally unacceptable at a later stage. Cost of adaptation when a project is already running is usually more. Thus, EIA as a tool aims to minimize the environmental impacts emanating out of any economic activity that have the potential to cause environmental degradation. ## **Rapid EIA vs Comprehensive EIA** The difference is in the time scale of the data supplied. But both types require complete coverage of all EIA procedures - **Rapid EIA**: Under Rapid EIA data supplied is of **only one season**(other than monsoon) to reduce the time required. Rapid EIA is for speedier appraisal process. - **Comprehensive EIA**: It collects data from **all four seasons.** Rapid EIA is acceptable if it does not compromise upon the quality of decision making. The review of Rapid EIA submissions will show whether a comprehensive EIA is warranted or not. Therefore, submission of comprehensive EIA in the first stance would generally be more efficient approach. Comprehensive EIA includes appraisal of those projects whose analysis in not to be done soon, here time is not the essential factor but the quality of the appraisal is. ## **EIA notifications** Central govt has the power to issue EIA notifications under **Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986**, wherein it can impose restrictions on setting up new projects or expansion or modernisation of existing projects. The section stipulates that such measures must benefit the environment. Under the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986, first EIA notification was issued in 1994. Later, it was replaced by a modified draft in 2006 **Salient Features of EIA rules Amendment done in 2006** - [Environmental Impact Assessment](https://blog.forumias.com/environmental-impact-assessment/) Notification 2006 decentralized the environmental clearance projects by categorizing the developmental projects in two categories i.e., **Category A** and **Category B** After 2006 Amendment, EIA comprises of four cycles: - Screening - Scoping - Public Hearing - Appraisal - State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) are constituted to provide clearance to category B projects. - Category A Projects require mandatory environmental clearance. Screening process is not required. - Category B projects undergo screening process. They are classified in two types: - Category B1 Projects: Mandatorily require EIA - Category B2 Projects: Do not require EIA Thus, - Category **A** projects and category **B1** projects undergo the **complete EIA** process - Category **B2** projects are **excluded from complete EIA** process This 2006 EIA notification has undergone several amendments over last 14 years. A new draft EIA Notification 2020 has been floated by the govt. It is meant to incorporate the amendments and court orders issued since 2006. **Major Provisions of draft EIA notification 2020** - **Public Consultation** - Period of public consultation hearings is proposed to be reduced to a maximum of 40 days. - Time provided for the public to submit their responses is proposed to be reduced from present 30 to 20 days. - **Rationale by the govt**: the shorter window was ‚Äúin tune with the times‚Äù, given the growth of internet and mobile telephony. - **Concern**: Several environmental activists and organisations have instead argued that even the 30-day timeframe was inadequate as information failed to reach the stakeholders residing in remote and inaccessible terrains - **More discretionary powers to government** - Central government can declare ‚Äúeconomically sensitive areas‚Äù without public hearing or environmental clearance - Government also gets to decide which projects are to be considered ‚Äústrategic‚Äù. - **Post-facto clearance**: Legalisation of projects that have commenced operations without obtaining necessary clearances; subject to a payment of penalty. **Supreme court‚Äôs view on post**‚Äì **facto clearance** ‚Äì - In a judgment in early 2020, in the case of _Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd vs Rohit Prajapati,_ the Supreme Court by also referring to _Common Cause vs. Union of India judgment_, struck down and **condemned** ex-post facto environmental clearance (a concept which the new draft EIA proposes to regularise). - In 2013, the Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court in the case of _Association for Environmental Protection vs State of Kerala_, held that commencement of projects without obtaining prior EC (environmental clearance) is a **violation of the fundamental right to life** guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution - **Post-clearance compliance:** Post-clearance compliance implies that once a project gets approved by the concerned authority, the proponent projects are required to adhere to certain rules laid down in the EIA report in order to ensure that no further environmental damages take place. - The new draft EIA, contrary to the 2006 notification ‚Äî which required submission of the compliance report every six months, **proposes annual reports.** - **Concern**: Environmental experts are of the view that allowing a longer period for filling the compliance report will give an opportunity to project proponents to hide disastrous consequences, which could go unnoticed - **Exemption clause**: It identifies a long list of projects like roads and pipelines in border areas which have been exempted from public consultation and prior clearance. - **Concern**: Analysts note that by this provision, the government shall have discretion to designate any project as being of strategic importance. Activists in states with crucial resources like uranium, as in Meghalaya, have also opposed this provision - **Baseline Data**: Does away with the need to carry out studies covering all seasons in a year In the 2019 ‚ÄòEase of Doing Business‚Äô report by the World Bank, India rose steadily from 142nd ranking in 2014 to 63rd ranking in 2019. India, however, has steadily declined on Environment Performance Index, from 141st rank in 2016 to 168th rank out of 180 countries in 2020. The government has assured that it will strive to **strike a balance** between the environmental and developmental concerns. As and when the EIA is finalised, it is expected to incorporate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in a balanced manner. ### **Shortcomings of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) process** **Applicability**: There are several projects with environmental impacts that are exempted from the notifications. Ex. Low scale sand mining **Inadequate capacity of EIA approval authorities**: Lack of technical and environmental experts, anthropologists and social scientists among the members and involvement of crony capitalism and nexus between corporates and politicians leads to faulty decision making, where projects which severe harm the environment may also get approved. **Deficiencies in screening, scoping and impact analysis**: There are no independent bodies and no standardized formats for project evaluation. - Absence of standardized baseline data brings arbitrariness in impact prediction. - It is allegedly done by those people which are on the payroll of company which creates a conflict of interest. They intentionally exclude negative impact on forests/ environment and impact on tribes during the scoping process **Poor quality EIA reports**: EIA is presently used as a project justification tool rather than as a project planning tool to contribute to achieving sustainable development. Involvement of planning for future activities should also be focused upon along with the justification of the project itself. - EIA is not just a tool to describe YES or NO regarding a project but also about how the harm, if any, to the environment can be minimized, so as to be pollution-neutral and environmentally sustainable. **Initiated at a later stage**: Another flaw in the EIA process in India is that it is undertaken at a much later stage, especially after the project has been designed, approved and almost ready for construction. Thus, by the time EIA starts huge costs are incurred and the project becomes too big to fall. **Inadequate public participation**: In many countries like Nepal, Argentina and Australia, public involvement is mandatory at various stages of the EIA process (i.e., screening, scoping, report preparation and decision making), but in India public consultation **occurs only once** during the entire process. According to the EIA notification 2006, this public consultation is performed in two ways. - First, written comments are sought on draft EIA report from stakeholders - Second, public hearing is conducted at or near the proposed project site. **Drawbacks of this system:** - Public consultation is done **after the preparation of draft EIA report** and when it is ready for final submission to the expert committee. - Also, the notification issued for public hearing are **not published in local vernacular languages** thus keeping it out of the scope of understanding of locals. **Weak monitoring**: Monitoring is not done through an independent agency. Environment management plans of strategic industries like nuclear energy are not put into the public domain. ### **How can we strengthen the EIA process?** **1.Independent Agency**: Entire EIA process right from screening to monitoring should be done by independent agencies and establishing a National Accreditation Body for agencies carrying out EIA. - Creation of centralized baseline data bank **2.Applying Precautionary Principle**: This principle states that if there is a threat of serious damage (in this case, to the environment) from a particular action then a lack of scientific certainty should not be used to avoid taking steps to prevent that damage. Hence, the list of concerns raised by the public should be studied in detail to arrive at any conclusion. Ex. GM crops. - Clearances given to project that is not clearly justified becomes questionable as happened in Sethusamudram Project **3.Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA)**: It helps in choosing a project and not just evaluate it. It offers alternatives and guides project financing. The directives of SEA are reflected in the National Environment Policy 2006. Similarly, Nepal also carries out SEA‚Äôs. - A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is a systematic process for evaluating the environmental implications of a proposed **policy**, **plan** or **programme** **4.Robust and Inclusive public hearing**: A key role for local people through Panchayats and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) at every stage. Special focus on forests and tribal. The traditional knowledge of locals needs to be incorporated. **5.Transparency**: Greater transparency in the clearance process and dissemination of all documents for public scrutiny. **6.Capacity Building**: NGO‚Äôs, civil society groups and local communities need to build their capacities to use the EIA notification towards better decision-making on projects that can impact their local environments and livelihoods. Capacities can be built to proactively and effectively use the notification rather than respond in a manner that is seen as negative or unproductive. ### **Way forward** In a world that is challenged by environmental degradation and social conflicts, scholars have upheld public and local participation to be a ‚Äúthreshold condition‚Äù for development. EIA provides this necessary element in the economic development process. Therefore, EIA-based approvals for most projects should mandatorily and necessarily involve the process of conducting public hearings so that the views and opinions of people who are likely to be affected can be taken on board before a decision to approve the project is made so as to reduce future scope of resentment. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Land Subsidence **Mains level:** Reasons for disasters at Himalaya ## **Context** - Disasters have become commonplace in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, the most recent one being the sinking of Joshimath. Although climate change has triggered these events, the most important underlying factors are poor planning and a lack of vision. [Crack Prelims 2023! Talk to our Rankers](https://bit.ly/cd_DI) ## [**Recent disasters on Himalaya**](https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-is-joshimath-crisis/) - **Kedarnath floods:** Nature has given enough warnings of the dangers in the Himalayas. The 2013 Kedarnath floods took more than 5,000 lives, according to official records. - **Nepal earthquake:** The 2015 Gurkha Earthquake in Nepal killed as many as 8000 individuals. - **Floods in Pakistan:** The recent floods in Pakistan left millions of people homeless and devastated. - **Sinking of Joshimath:** The ‚ÄòJoshimath sinking‚Äô phenomenon has received national and global attention. However, other cities and towns across Uttarakhand are also on the brink of collapse. Joshimath is the first one to succumb to human pressures, thankfully without causing any damage to human lives. ## **Reasons for disasters at Himalaya (Uttarakhand)** - **Construction in Prohibited areas:** The geological fragility of Uttarakhand is part of scientific and popular knowledge. Government policies and bylaws prohibit people from constructing houses on vulnerable slopes. - **Mindless decision making:** With increasing access to internet facilities, almost everyone can find information. Yet one is compelled to ask about the role technological advancement and information abundance have played in environmental decision-making as mindless construction over vulnerable slopes continues uninhibited. - **Ignorance by bureaucrats:** The technicalities of science and academic jargon are complex for bureaucrats to understand and laypersons and bureaucratic mindsets only engage with the research community for obligatory and cosmetic purposes. ## **Infrastructure of mountainous area and plain area** - **Normal construction methods for fragile ecology:** We have continued to borrow practices from elsewhere for implementation on the delicate eco-geological systems of the Himalayas. - **Gurugramisation of Uttarakhand:** Gurugram‚Äôs infrastructure development took a toll on Gurugram itself. For the Himalayas, Gurugram-style development is enormously devastating. The ‚ÄúGurugramisation‚Äù of Uttarakhand needs to stop. - **Disregards to laws and regulations:** The divide between science‚Äìpolicy, and people, has promoted disconnected decision-making and encouraged individuals to casually flout bylaws and regulatory policies. A common Uttarakhandi is forced to live a life full of uncertainty and fear. ## _**Case study of Nainital**_ - **Vulnerable to landslides:** Nainital, one of the most vulnerable cities in the entire Himalayan region. The Nainital lake is situated over an active Faultline and surrounded by slopes vulnerable to landslides. - **Earthquake prone area:** It falls under a high earthquake-prone zone (Zone IV). Since its settlement in 1841 small and big landslides continue to threaten the city. The most devastating of them was the 1880 landslide that took 151 human lives. - **Construction on vulnerable slopes:** Despite having robust scientific evidence, building bylaws, and an aware citizenry, the brutal assaults on the biophysical environment of the city are ongoing. The slope that collapsed in 1880 (less than a fraction of a second earlier on a geological time scale) is now inhabited by more than 15,000 individuals. - **Ground water exploitation:** In 2017, the Nainital lake level plummeted 18 feet due to the excessive withdrawal of water from the lake bed to meet local and unprecedented tourism needs. Such a decline was never experienced in the past. - **Mindless tourism activities:** The biggest threat to Nainital is the crumbling ‚ÄúBalianala‚Äù. To make matters worse, construction work over the most important recharge area of the Nainital lake ‚ÄúSukhatal‚Äù is underway. The intention is to enhance tourism-related activity. But the question is, does a city that receives more than 10,000 tourists and 2,000 vehicles on a daily basis in the summer months and weekends need more tourism? ## **Conclusion** - The carrying capacity of the cities in Himalayas has been exhausted. The natural infrastructure is fatigued and dangers of a possible collapse are visible to the human eye. Government must the amend and implement the construction laws and regulations for sustainability of Himalayas. **Mains Question** **Q. What are the reasons for recent sinking in Joshi math?

The soil is, therefore, not ideal for large constructions. - **Seismically active area:** Added to this is the fact that the area falls in a highly seismic zone, and experiences regular tremors, making the top soil unstable. ## **Preventing a disaster** 1976 Mishra Committee Report suggested- - **Imposition of restrictions on heavy construction:** Construction should only be allowed after examining the load-bearing capacity of the soil and the stability of the site, and restrictions should also be imposed on the excavation of slopes. - **Keeping the boulders:** In the landslide areas, stones and boulders should not be removed from the bottom of the hill as it would remove toe support, increasing the possibility of landslides. - **Sealing of cracks:** Cracks which have developed on the slopes should be sealed. The toe of a landslide is its bottom-most point. - **Conserving of trees:** It has also advised against cutting trees in the landslide zone, and said that extensive plantation work should be undertaken in the area, particularly between Marwari and Joshimath, to conserve soil and water resources. - **Agriculture on the slopes must be avoided:** Activities like ploughing loosens the soil thereby triggering the scope for landslides. - **Preventing water seepage:** To prevent any more landslides in the future, the seepage of open rain water must be stopped by the construction of a pucca drainage system. - **Cobbled roads:** Roads should be metalled and without scuppers, that drain away the water from the road surface. - **River training:** The construction of structures to guide the river‚Äôs flow should be carried out. Hanging boulders on the foothills should be provided with appropriate support. ## **Way forward** - **Ensuring safety of people:** This should be immediate priority. State government should establish a clear and continuous communication channel with the affected people. - **Time-bound reconstruction plan** must be prepared. - **Continuous seismic monitoring** must be done. - **A** **risk sensitive urban development plan** for Joshimath should also be developed.

In June this year Assam experienced one of its worst floods in which it affected over 30 districts. Assam and Bihar frequently suffer from transboundary flood disasters. #### **What is [transboundary flood](https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-recurring-floods-in-india/)?** - Floods that are originate in upper riparian state crosses the international boundary and also affects the lower riparian state. For example, river Brahmaputra causes flood both in China and India simultaneously. #### **How the transboundary floods are difficult to manage than [normal floods](https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/floods/)?** - Flooding is still considered to be a natural phenomenon that cannot be entirely prevented. But it is compounded by the lack of transparency in the sharing of hydrological information and also information relating to activities (such as by one riparian state) that are transboundary in their effect (affecting other riparian states), thus serving as an obstacle in understanding the magnitude of flooding **.** #### **What is a riparian state?** - A riparian state is state (or country) located alongside a river. #### **What are the International laws governing transboundary waters?** There are at two international treaties that governs the transboundary water - **UNWC:** - United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Use of International Watercourses (UNWC) 1997.UNWC contains a direct reference to floods, which covers harmful conditions and the emergency situations. - Article 27 of the Convention says, Watercourse States shall individually and, where appropriate, jointly, take all appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate conditions that may be harmful to other watercourse States, whether resulting from natural causes or human conduct or desertification. - **Environmental Impact Assessment:** - The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in the Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina vs Uruguay) case of 2010, upheld that conducting a transboundary environmental impact assessment (TEIA) of a planned measure or projects on the shared water course is part of customary international law. - In fact, the ICJ noted that the acting state must notify the affected party of the results of TEIA for assessment of its own damages that are likely to occur. - **UNECE:** United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes 1992 (Water Convention). #### **How India manages transboundary flood?** - **Note:** Neither India nor China are signatory to UNWC or UNCEC. - **River Brahmaputra:** India has signed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China in 2013 with a view to sharing hydrological information during the flood season (June to September). The MoU does not allow India access to urbanisation and deforestation activities on the Chinese side of the river basin. - **Rivers Gandak and kosi**: Floods are also a recurrent problem in the Kosi and Gandak river basins that are shared by India and Nepal. - **The India-Nepal Kosi agreement 1954:** Agreement aimed at reducing devastating flooding in the river basin. The treaty-based joint bodies have also tried to refine the early warning systems for flood forecasting. #### **What are the suggestions?** - **Signing the treaty:** Expert suggests, India by becoming a party to either the UNWC and the Water Convention could lay the groundwork for a bilateral treaty on the Brahmaputra but subject to the reservation that it should not insist on the insertion of a dispute settlement mechanism provision **.** - **Information exchange:** In contravention of procedural customary international law obligation, India considers data on transboundary rivers as classified information, which is one of the key challenges in developing cross-border flood warning systems. India needs to share the hydrological and river information for its own sake. #### **Conclusion** - Climate change has accelerated the frequency and intensity of floods across the world. with Changing climate India should also change its strategy to protect its people, to preserve the soil and to save its resources from the scourge of floods. > **Mains Questions** > > **Q.Climate change has created a more difficult challenge in flood management.

Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions. - The Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front (TPLF) ‚Äì was influential in setting up this system. - It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power. - Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy. #### How did it escalate into a crisis? - Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed PM. - Abiy liberalized politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression. - Meanwhile, Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. - These moves won Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray. - Tigray‚Äôs leaders see Abiy‚Äôs reforms as an attempt to centralize power and destroy Ethiopia‚Äôs federal system. #### How bad is the humanitarian situation? - Tigray and its neighbouring regions are facing starvation. - There is an absence of medical facilities, no access to their own money due to shut-down banking services, ethnic and physical violence, and raids at the hands of warring forces. - The government declared a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds but in an effort to break the TPLF in June last year, imposed a blockade on Tigray. - This made it impossible to deliver humanitarian, economic, and medical assistance to Tigrayans. #### Also read: > [\\[Burning Issue\\] Ethiopian Crisis and the Geopolitics](https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-ethiopian-crisis/) [UPSC 2023 countdown has begun!

Since the material is elastic, the energy is released in the form of elastic waves. - These propagate to a distance determined by the extent of the impact. These are known as seismic waves. #### Why Earthquake in Afghanistan? - Afghanistan is earthquake-prone because it‚Äôs located in the mountainous Hindu Kush region, which is part of the Alpide belt ‚Äî the second most seismically active region in the world after the Pacific Ring of Fire. - The Alpide belt runs about 15,000 kilometers, from the southern part of Eurasia through the Himalayas and into the Atlantic. - Along with the Hindu Kush, it includes a number of mountain ranges, such as the Alps, Atlas Mountains and the Caucasus Mountains. - Additionally, the Earth‚Äôs crust is especially lively in Afghanistan because it is where the Arabian, Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. - The boundary between the Indian and Eurasian plates exists near Afghanistan‚Äôs border with Pakistan. #### How are earthquakes measured? - Earthquakes are measured by seismographic networks, which are made of seismic stations, each of which measures the shaking of the ground beneath it. - In India, the **National Seismological Network** does this work. - It has a history of about 120 years and its sensors can now detect an earthquake within five to ten minutes. #### Issues with Earthquake measurement - Everywhere, the wave parameters are measured, not the total energy released. - There is a direct relationship between the quantum of energy released and the wave amplitude. - The amplitude of the wave is a function of the time period of the wave. - It is possible to convert the measured wave amplitude into the energy released for that earthquake. - This is what seismologists call the magnitude of the earthquake. #### What is the Richter magnitude scale? - This is a measure of the magnitude of an earthquake and was first defined by Charles F. Richter of the California Institute of Technology, U.S., in 1935. - The magnitude of an earthquake is the logarithm of the amplitude of the waves measured by the seismographs. - Richter scale magnitudes are expressed as a whole number and a decimal part, for example 6.3 or 5.2. - Since it is a logarithmic scale, an increase of the whole number by one unit signifies a tenfold increase in the amplitude of the wave and a 31-times increase of the energy released. #### How are zones designated? - Based on seismicity, intensity of earthquakes experienced, and geological and tectonic qualities of a region, countries are divided into several zones. - In India, for example, there are four zones, designated Zone II-Zone V. Among these, Zone V is the most hazardous and Zone II the least hazardous. #### Can we predict Earthquakes? - Since parameters of the earthquake are unknown, it is near impossible to predict an earthquake. - The problem with earthquakes is that they are heavily dependent on the material property, which varies from place to place. - If there are elastic waves propagating through a material, there are two kinds of waves ‚Äî the primary wave which reaches first, and the second one called the secondary wave, which is more destructive. - If it is known that the amount of energy released is extremely high, trains and power grids can be shut down and the damage minimised. - This has worked in some locations, but not on a large commercial basis. #### Successful attempts made so far - The most successful early warning systems are in Japan. - They have several hundreds of thousands recording devices. - Responses are sent to a central point where they estimate whether it is large enough to form a tsunami or some other hazard, and precautionary steps are taken.

A catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or man-made causes, or 2. It results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to, and destruction of, property, or damage to, or degradation of, environment, and 3. Damage is of such a nature or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area. #### How can any of these be classified as a national disaster? - There is no provision, executive or legal, to declare a natural calamity as a national calamity. - The existing guidelines of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF)/ National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), do not contemplate declaring a disaster as a National Calamity. #### Has there ever been an attempt to define a national calamity? - In 2001, the National Committee under the chairmanship of the then PM was mandated to look into the parameters that should define a national calamity. - However, the committee did not suggest any fixed criterion. #### How, then, does the government classify disasters/calamities? - The 10th Finance Commission (1995-2000) examined a proposal that a disaster be termed ‚Äúa national calamity of rarest severity‚Äù if it affects one-third of the population of a state. - The panel did not define a ‚Äúcalamity of rare severity‚Äù but stated that a calamity of rare severity would necessarily have to be adjudged on a case-to-case basis taking into account. #### What happens if a calamity is so declared? - When a calamity is declared to be of ‚Äúrare severity/severe nature‚Äù, support to the state government is provided at the national level. - The Centre also considers additional assistance from the NDRF. - A Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) is set up, with the corpus shared 3:1 between Centre and state. - When resources in the CRF are inadequate, additional assistance is considered from the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF), funded 100% by the Centre. - Relief in repayment of loans or for grant of fresh loans to the persons affected on concessional terms, too, are considered once a calamity is declared ‚Äúsevere‚Äù. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) **Mains level:** Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Fearing any surge in coronavirus cases in the national capital, which is witnessing a decline in cases of infection, the Delhi government has chalked out the ‚ÄòGraded Response Action Plan (GRAP).‚Äô #### Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) - In 2014, when a study by the WHO found that Delhi was the most polluted city in the world, panic spread in the Centre and the state government. - Approved by the Supreme Court in 2016, the plan was formulated after several meetings that the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) held with state government and experts. - The result was a plan that institutionalized measures to be taken when air quality deteriorates. - GRAP also works as an emergency measure. - It includes strict measures such as a ban on the entry of heavy vehicles, the odd-even road rationing restrictions, and a halt of construction work ‚Äì each of which is likely to be impractical at a time when the pandemic has exacted heavy economic costs and public transport has been seen as an infection risk. #### For covid purposes - This time, it was decided to notify the GRAP that will ‚Äúobjectively and transparently‚Äù ensure an ‚Äúinstitutional and automatic‚Äù response with regards to enforcement measures, lockdowns and unlock activities. - The plan was prepared in comparison with ascent data of the four waves at specific positivity rates of 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 5% and also considered on the basis of the earlier four waves. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Disaster Management Act **Mains level:** Compensation for disaster victims and its limitations The Supreme Court has reserved its verdict seeking compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of those who have died of Covid-19 or related complications. The Centre has stated that state governments cannot afford to pay this, and had argued in favor of a broader approach including health interventions. #### Provisions for Compensation - Last year, the Centre declared Covid-19 as a notified disaster under the Disaster Management Act. - Section 12(iii) of the Act says the National Authority shall recommend guidelines for the minimum standards of relief to be provided to persons affected by disaster. - It includes ‚Äúex gratia assistance on account of loss of life as also assistance on account of damage to houses and for restoration of means of livelihood‚Äù. - The Centre revises this amount from time to time. #### What is the latest amount? - On April 8, 2015, the Disaster Management Division of the Home Ministry wrote to all state governments and attached a revised list of ‚Äúnorms of assistance‚Äù. - Under ‚Äúex gratia payment to families of deceased persons‚Äù, it specified: Rs 4 lakh per deceased person including those involved in relief operations or associated in preparedness activities. - This is subjected to certification regarding cause of death from appropriate authority. #### So, what about compensation for Covid? - Last year the Home Ministry wrote to state governments that the central government has decided to treat it (Covid-19) as a notified disaster for the purpose of providing assistance under SDRF. - It attached a partially modified list of items and norms of assistance. - It did not specify payment of ex gratia to families of deceased. - Some states have decided to pay, but not for all deaths. #### How has the government responded to the petition? - The Centre has submitted that ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh is beyond the affordability of state governments. - It argued that if Rs 4 lakh is paid to the kin of each, it ‚Äúmay possibly‚Äù consume the entire amount of the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). - This would leave states with insufficient funds for organizing a response to the pandemic, or to take care of other disasters. - The centre argued that the term ex gratia itself means the amount is not based on legal entitlement. #### Way ahead - A broader approach, which involves health interventions, social protection, and economic recovery for the affected communities would be a more prudent, responsible, and sustainable approach. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Not much **Mains level:** Paper 3- Data driven approach to deal with the future disruptions > _Article highlights the importance of data driven approach in dealing with the future disruptions and suggests the reforms in the system._ #### Managing the disruption through data-driven tools - The data-driven tools were used for managing pandemic induced disruption. - This offers an opportunity **to restructure the data ecosystem** for managing the disruptions of the future that are more likely to be driven by climate change. #### Policies for data sharing in India - The National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), 2012 recognises the importance of data. - NDSAP recognised the importance of data **in improving decision making**, meeting the **needs of civil society** and **generating revenue** by permitting access to datasets. - In 2012, **a government portal, data.gov.in** was also established as a unified platform to enable sharing of data available with ministries, departments and other public agencies **for wider public use.** - The sharing of data in this platform, apart from others, is further streamlined through the nodality of Chief Data Officer-CDO in respective ministries. #### Challenges - Challenge remains about whether the collected data is usable, accessible and if it captures the details that end users are interested in. - Even after years of the portal‚Äôs operationalisation, there are multiple data-sets that **aren‚Äôt updated regularly.** - Though NITI Aayog has brought indices to track climate actions such as under SDG-13 of SDG India Index, but it **remains vague in tracking improvements in climate resilience,** by solely using number of lives lost due to extreme weather events. #### Reforms needed in data-ecosystem - **1) Complete dataset:** There is a need **to collect complete datasets** required to assess climate risks and vulnerabilities. - This involves collection of datasets that are sex-disaggregated and geo-spatial and collect more nuanced dimensions like disaster response capacities. - **Targeted research:** There is a requirement of targeted research for designing better questionnaires and identifying new nodes for data collection. - 2) **Reliability of data:** The data collected has to be made reliable and usable through an accountability framework. - **Legislation:** A separate legislation in this regard would bring in the much-needed consistency in periodic collection of identified datasets and their proactive sharing in designated platforms. - 3) **Centralisation of data:** There is a need for **centralising public data** that currently exists with different departments and public institutions. - The **National Data Governance Centre** was planned to be set up in 2019 for precisely this objective. - But it is yet to be operationalised. > _Consider the question ‚ÄúHow data driven approach could help India deal with the future disruptions that are more likely to be from climate change?

The Himalayan region is home to the **largest ice mass outside of the planet‚Äôs Polar Regions.** - The glaciers in the Himalayas are melting at a faster rate creating new lakes and expanding the existing ones. - The rising temperatures and extreme precipitation events make the region increasingly prone to a variety of natural hazards, including devastating **glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).** - GLOFs occur when either a natural dam containing a glacial lake bursts or when the lake‚Äôs level suddenly increases and overflows its banks, leading to catastrophic downstream destruction. - However, the remote, challenging Himalayan terrain and the overall **lack of cellular connectivity** throughout the region have made the development of early flood warning systems virtually impossible. - In their recent work the Scientists point out that the **surge of meltwater in mountain streams** is most commonly caused by cloud-burst events during the monsoon season (June‚ÄìJuly‚ÄìAugust) time frame. #### Satelitte-based real-time monitoring - Satellite-based real-time monitoring of Himalayan glacial catchments would **improve understanding of flood risk** in the region and help inform an early flood warning system that could help curb disaster and save human lives, says a recent study. - This should be the future strategy to reduce loss of human lives during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), said a study carried out by scientists from **IIT Kanpur**. - The IIT Kanpur team suggests that efforts to help mitigate GLOF events in the future should include **the creation of a network of satellite-based monitoring stations** that could provide in situ and real-time data on GLOF risk. - The integration of monitoring devices with satellite networks will not only provide **telemetry support in remote locations** that lack complete cellular connectivity but will also provide greater connectivity in coverage in the cellular dead zones in extreme topographies such as valleys, cliffs, and steep slopes. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** CDRI **Mains level:** India's leadership in Climate change mitigation The Prime Minister has recently addressed the third edition of the annual conference of the Coalition for Disaster resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). #### What is CDRI? -

According to Planet Labs, **ice along with frozen mud and rocks** fell down from a high mountain inside the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, from a height of 5,600 m to 3,300 m. - This created an artificial lake within the sanctuary in Rontigad, a tributary of Rishi Ganga. - Within eight hours, this lake burst open and its water, laden with mud and stones, rushed through the Rishi Ganga gorge which opens near Reni. - Studies say that the current winter season has seen little rain and snow, with temperatures being highest in the last six decades. - So, the effects of chemical weathering were much more active in the higher Himalayas. - There is a **possibility of more such events this year.** #### Factors responsible #### 1) Development with no regard for the environment - As a mountain system, the Himalayas have had earthquakes, avalanches, landslides, soil erosion, forest fires and floods, and these are its natural expressions, parts of its being. - Except for earthquakes, **humans have directly contributed towards aggravating all the other phenomena.** - **The Ravi Chopra committee** formed by the SC recommended closure of all the 24 hydro projects in question by Wildlife Institute of India. - The SC also formed another committee to look at the impact of the Chaardham road project. - Road and hydro projects are being operated in the Himalayas with practically no rigorous research on the **ecological history of the area, cost-benefit analysis** and many other aspects including displacement of communities, destruction of biodiversity, agricultural land, pastures as well as the cultural heritage of the area. #### Dilution of Environmental Impact Assessment rules - Earlier, **while independent experts carried out the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA),** today it is assigned to a government agency, which does the work for other government departments. - Furthermore, during the lockdown, the government changed the EIA rules and diluted labour laws (most of the workers in both the affected projects belong to unorganised sector) in the name of pandemic measures. #### 2) Climate change - Another factor which cannot be overlooked is that of climate change. - Studies have suggested that the pace of this change is faster in mountains and fastest in the Himalayas. - While earthquakes and weathering work at their own pace, climate change can contribute towards altering their natural speed. #### Need for studying the 2013 calamity - We can look back at the terrible calamity of 2013, and see how it washed away the encroachments in river areas-dams, barrages, tunnels, buildings, roads. - The communities paid a much heavier price than what they received in compensation. - Further, the 2013 calamity has to be studied and understood in all the other regions and river valleys of Uttarakhand, Western Nepal and Himachal. - It was not specific to Kedarnath, although much of the focus was directed there. - Till date, we don‚Äôt have **any white paper on this calamity.** - The India Meteorological Department failed in its prediction and wrongly announced at the end of the first week of June that the monsoon will reach Uttarakhand by June 27-28. - It reached on June 16-17 with 300-400 per cent more rain, a record never heard of before. - 24 big and small hydro projects were destroyed. - The muck created by these projects was also the cause of their destruction. -

Almost all of them are receding. Most of the glaciers also have debris cover. - When glaciers retreat due to rising temperatures, the snow melts but the debris remains. This debris aids in the formation of lakes. #### Cause: Retreat of glaciers - Glaciers have reduced considerably in mass and surface area since the little ice age period. - This has led to the formation of a large number of glacial lakes all across the Himalayas. - Many of these high-altitude lakes are potentially dangerous, because of their potential to cause flash floods in the event of a breach. #### How big is the threat? - Over the years, the frequency of formation of these lakes has increased. - But despite that, there are not many GLOF (glacial lake outburst flood) events happening in Uttarakhand. - Not as many as in Sikkim, for example. This is because Uttarakhand has very steep slopes, and the water manages to find a way out. #### What should be done? **(a) Coherent research** - There are a lot more glaciologists and others who are working in the area and generating data. - Multiple scientific groups and institutions are involved. But there is no coherent output. Lots of data are being generated but not being put to good use. - There has to be one agency dedicated to the job. **(b) Monitoring** - The first step in tackling the threat from these glacial lakes is to start monitoring them and the glaciers more actively and regularly. - There is a need to monitor every glacier. Glaciers in one basin do not have remarkably different properties. - Relying only on satellites and remote sensing is not going to be enough. - What is required is a consolidated state of glaciers in India, with the ability to zoom in on any of them and track the changes happening year by year. **(c) Planning** - Construction-related activities in the state might not have a direct link to Chamoli incident, but these are not entirely benign. - The Himalayas are very young mountain systems, and extremely fragile and a minor change in orientation of the rocks can be enough to trigger landslides. - It is important to include glaciers in any environment impact assessment for major projects such as the construction of dams. - The entire catchment areas should be made part of the impact assessment. **(d) Mitigation** - If we monitor the glaciers regularly, it would enable us to identify the lakes that need mitigation solutions. - Several structural and geotechnical measures can be applied, and there are successful examples where the threat from these lakes has been reduced. - It is possible to construct channels for the gradual and regulated discharge of water from these lakes, which will reduce the pressure on them, and minimise the chances of a breach. - At the same time, it also reduces the volume of water that goes into the flash flood. Also, alarm systems can be set up at the lakes that will warn the community downstream whenever an overflow happens. #### Way forward - It is not possible to completely prevent these kinds of incidents. But their potential to cause destruction can certainly be minimized. - Scientists can find a way to let the lake waters slowly drain at the nearby river at a regulated rate so that there is no flooding, and the pressure on the lake does not become unbearable. - Such solutions can be applied in Uttarakhand, and some work is being done. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Dams in Uttarakhand **Mains level:** Risks posed by Hydel projects The flash flood that claimed several lives in Chamoli has caused Uttarakhand‚Äôs hydroelectric projects (HEPs) to be scrutinized closely. > _Q.How do hydropower projects pose geological and topographical threats to the ecosystem? (150W)_ #### Why Hydropower in Uttarakhand? - Uttarakhand has a tricky relationship with electricity. - With a landscape that‚Äôs inhospitable to thermal power grid lines and with people too poor to pay for electricity, micro and mini hydro-electric power projects were seen as the answer. - Between the government‚Äôs long-standing ‚Äòpower for all‚Äô objective, and environmentalists pushing for a cleaner, renewable energy, setting up dozens of hydel power plants seemed ideal. #### Impacts of HEPs Limitless quarrying, deforestation, stopping the flow of rivers, and mushrooming of hydropower projects have made the Himalayas unstable. - Existing and under-construction hydro-power projects in Uttarakhand have led to several deleterious environmental impacts (Char Dham Committee). - Among the significant impacts are on the river ecosystem, forest and terrestrial biodiversity, geological environment and social infrastructure. - More than seven years later, some experts believe that over-exploitation of rivers and rampant damming for hydroelectric projects (HEPs) could be one of the big factors responsible for the Chamoli disaster. - The ‚Äòriver-bed profile‚Äô across the major HEPs of Uttarakhand has changed significantly, suggesting the possibility of disasters in future. #### The Kedarnath floods - Between June 13 and 17, 2013, Uttarakhand had received an unusual amount of rainfall. - This led to the melting of the Chorabari glacier and the eruption of the Mandakini river. - The floods affected large parts of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Western Nepal. - The heavy rainfall caused massive flash floods and landslides resulting in the death of residents and tourists as well as extensive damage to property. - Over 5,000 people were killed in the floods #### Construction still persists - Neglecting all warnings of the experts, rampant construction was carried out in the sensitive zones even after the 2013 Kedarnath deluge. - Notably, two dozen hydropower plants of Uttarakhand were rejected by the Supreme Court after the expert panel report. #### HEPs in Uttarakhand The rivers and basins in the state are dotted with 43 micro hydel projects. Some of them are: #### Alarms have been raised earlier - The Kedarnath expert committee had warned about the excessive exploitation of vulnerable regions and the need to re-study and re-evaluate the HEPs of Uttarakhand. - The report also objected to HEPs at an altitude of over 2000 metres. - The report pointed out that the potential threat of landslide, cloudburst, subsidence, flash floods has increased tremendously in the past few years and many critical zones need immediate attention. - The study also mentioned that a lot of anthropogenic pressure due to different activities related to HEPs was alarming and needed checks. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Doomsday Clock **Mains level:** Various existential threat to mankind The hands of the ‚ÄòDoomsday Clock‚Äô, a visual depiction of how vulnerable the world is to a climate or nuclear catastrophe, remained at ‚Äò100 seconds to midnight‚Äô for the second consecutive year ‚Äî the closest it has been to the symbolic annihilation of humanity. > _Q.The ‚ÄòDoomsday Clock‚Äô represents the hypothetical countdown to raise human consciousness against mutually assured destruction. In this light, discuss various existential threats to humanity and action taken so far._ #### What is the ‚ÄòDoomsday Clock‚Äô? - The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, founded by Albert Einstein and students from the University of Chicago in 1945, created the ‚ÄòDoomsday Clock‚Äô. - It is held as a symbol to represent how close the world is to a possible apocalypse. - It is set annually by a panel of scientists, including 13 Nobel laureates, based on the threats ‚Äî old and new ‚Äî that the world faced in that year. - When it was first created in 1947, the hands of the clock were placed based on the threat posed by nuclear weapons, which the scientists then perceived to be the greatest threat to humanity. - Over the years, they have included other existential threats, such as climate change and disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence. #### Significance of such clock - The reason the scientists selected a clock is twofold ‚Äî they wanted to use the imagery of an apocalypse (midnight) as well as the ‚Äúcontemporary idiom of a nuclear explosion‚Äù (zero countdowns) to illustrate the threats to humanity. - The clock was originally set to seven minutes to midnight and has since moved closer or further away from the dreaded 12 o‚Äôclock position. - The furthest it has been being 17 minutes after the end of the Cold War in 1991. #### Why was the clock set at ‚Äò100 seconds from midnight‚Äô? - It was set at the ‚Äò100 seconds from midnight‚Äô position due to the prevailing climate conditions, ‚Äúcyber-based disinformation‚Äù, nuclear risk and the pandemic. - It is the closest to Doomsday we have ever been in the history of the Clock. - We now face a true emergency ‚Äì an absolutely unacceptable state of world affairs that has eliminated any margin for error or further delay. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** CAPFs **Mains level:** Paper 3- Role of CAPFs in disaster management. > _The article emphasises the role played by the CAPFs in dealing with the disasters._ #### Dealing with the disasters - When disaster strikes our country, be it natural or man-made, the government summons the **Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs)** to carry out the task of overcoming the disaster. - The CAPFs help in carrying out rescue and relief operations, and also mitigates the pains and problems arising out of the disaster. #### Role played by CAPFS during Covid - CAPFs comprise the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Sashastra Seema Bal, Assam Rifles and the ITBP. - Even before the country got to know about the COVID-19, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) had already set up its 600-bed quarantine centre in Chawla on the outskirts of New Delhi. - The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had roped in specialists from the Safdarjung Hospital to coordinate with ITBP officials. - Doctors and paramedical personnel of other CAPFs were also roped in. - The expertise acquired by ITBP personnel and the **Standard Operating Procedure** prepared by the ITBP came handy for the States and other police forces in establishing their own quarantine centres and COVID-19 hospitals. #### Role of NDRF during Covid-19 - NDRF personnel are **wholly drawn from the CAPFs.** - So, they form a good reserve of trained personnel when they go back to their parent force after their stint with NDRF. - With **12 battalions of the NDRF**‚Äî each comprising 1,149 personnel ‚Äî **spread across the country,** its experts have the core competency to tackle biological disasters like COVID-19. - Such personnel can be deployed at quarantines centres after short-term courses. - A proposal mooted by NITI Aayog last year, to conduct a bridge course for dentists to render them eligible for the MBBS degree, could be revived, and such doctors could be on stand-by to help in such emergency crises. #### Conclusion It is these CAPF personnel who give a semblance of existence of government administration even in the remotest corners of the country. Their versatile experience can be utilised to the nation‚Äôs advantage. #### B2BASICS: #### CAPF The Central Armed Police Forces refers to uniform nomenclature of five security forces in India under the authority of Ministry of Home Affairs.

Critically comment._ #### What is Ammonium Nitrate? - In its pure form, ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) is a white, crystalline chemical which is soluble in water. - A common chemical ingredient of agricultural fertilizers, the nitrogen-rich compound is also the main component of the explosive composition known as ANFO ‚Äî ammonium nitrate fuel oil. - It is the main ingredient in the manufacture of commercial explosives used in mining and construction. - Many Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) used by terrorists around the world have ANFO as the main explosive, triggered by primary explosives like RDX or TNT. - In the majority of terror attacks in India, ammonium nitrate has been used along with initiator explosives like RDX. #### Ammonium nitrate as an explosive - Pure ammonium nitrate is not an explosive on its own. - It is classified as an oxidiser (Grade 5.1) under the UN classification of dangerous goods. - If mixed with ingredients like fuel or some other contaminants, or because of some other external factors, it can be very explosive. #### Stored ammonium nitrate is a major fire hazard - Large quantities of stored ammonium nitrate are regarded as a major fire hazard, with multiple reported cases across the world. - The explosion of large storage can happen primarily in two ways. - One is by some type of detonation or initiation because the storage comes in contact with the explosive mixture. - Second, the blast can result due to a fire which starts in the ammonium nitrate store because of the heat generated due to the oxidation process at large scale. #### Regulations in India about ammonium nitrate - Because it is used as an ingredient for the production of explosives, anaesthetic gases, fertilizers, cold packs and has a possibility of misuse, it is highly regulated in India. - There exists the Ammonium Nitrate Rules, 2012, under The Explosives Act, 1884. - It defines ammonium nitrate as the compound with formula NH4NO3 including any mixture or compound having more than 45 per cent ammonium nitrate by weight. - The manufacture, conversion, bagging, import, export, transport, possession for sale or use of ammonium nitrate is covered under The Ammonium Nitrate Rules, 2012. - The rules also make storage of ammonium nitrate in large quantities in populated areas illegal in India. - For the manufacture of ammonium nitrate, an Industrial licence is required under the Industrial Development and Regulation Act, 1951. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** PM CARES **Mains level:** Paper 3- Disaster Management Act, National Plan > The Disaster Management Act (DMA) 2005 has been invoked by the government to deal with the pandemic. However, National Plan as provided under the Act to deal with Covid-19 is nowhere to be found. Also, the creations of PM CARES violated the provision of the DMA-2005. These two issues are discussed here. #### Provisions of DMA 2005 - The Act, along with other things provides the constitution of a National Authority, a National Executive committee. - It also provides for the constitution of an **advisory committee of experts** in the field to make recommendations and to **prepare a national plan.** - This plan must provide for measures for **prevention or mitigation.** - The Act lays down ‚Äúguidelines for minimum standards of relief, including _**ex gratia**_ assistance. #### Provision of various Funds under DMA 2005 - It enables the creation of a National Disaster Response Fund in which the central government must make due contribution. - It also requires ‚Äúany **grants that may be made by any person** or institution for the purpose of disaster management‚Äù **to be credited into the same Fund.** - It also provides for a National Disaster Mitigation Fund, exclusively for **mitigation.** - The Act also provides for State and local-level plans and for creating State Disaster Response Fund among others. #### Provision of disaster management plan - After the direction by the SC, the government came out with a National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP), 2016. - This Plan dealt with various kinds of disasters; it was amended in 2019. - Bu this National Plan not in place now. - Without it, the fight against COVID-19 is ad hoc and has resulted in thousands of government orders. - These orders are confusing those who are to enforce them as well as the public. #### NDRF and PM CARES issue - On April 3, 2020, the government of India agreed to contribute its share to the NDRF. - But a **public charitable trust** under the name of Prime Minister‚Äôs Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund) was set up to receive grants made by persons and institutions out of the NDRF, in violation of Section 46 of the Act. - The crores being sent to this fund are **not even audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.** - It is a totally opaque exercise. - The government of the day has not only ignored the binding law but also circumvented it. - The government has been fighting the crisis in an ad hoc and arbitrary manner instead of the organised steps as mandated by the Act. - In so doing, the experts have been sidelined. > Consider the question ‚ÄúDescribe the various provision of the DMA 2005 to deal with the disaster. In light of this, examine whether the creation of PM CARES conflicts with the provision of his act‚Äù #### Conclusion The national plan to deal with the pandemic and making PM CARES more transparent would help the government in its fight against the corona crisis. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Himlayan mountain ranges **Mains level:** Landslides in India This newscard talks about the city of Dharamshala where landslides occur frequently. > #### Practice question for mains: > > Q.‚ÄúHimalayan region is more susceptible to floods and flood induced landslides than the Western Ghats‚Äù. Discuss. #### Why is Dharamshala more vulnerable to landslides? - Dharamshala has a slope varying from gentle to steep, depending on different parts of the city. - It is located in Zone V in the earthquake hazard zoning map of India. - The large differences in slope between different parts of the city make it more susceptible to critical hazards like landslides. - The vulnerability of the geologically young steep slopes of Dhauladhar has increased because of anthropogenic activities and illegal construction due to the lack of availability of land. #### Why do landslides occur? - Increasing urbanisation, deforestation and encroachment of areas at high hill slopes, unscientific road cutting and water-intensive agricultural practices contributed to the increase in intensity and frequency of landslides. - The situation is worse during the monsoon when landslide-prone areas are washed away due to exposure. - This is due to the demand for living within the city. It is not just the difference between slopes, but also anthropogenic causes that lead to the emergence of hazards like landslides. #### Why tourist spots are more vulnerable? #### 1) Road traffic is high - During the peak tourist season, the road is marred with traffic jams due to continuous sinking. - Several factors have continuously contributed to an increase in the road‚Äôs vulnerability. The first is Illegal construction and uncontrolled levelling of hillocks along the roads. - Hillocks are flattened to accommodate housing projects, commercial establishments, etc. The informal sector often starts residing in these areas which are more vulnerable to risks. - These areas have comparatively lower land values and fewer people come to settle here. #### 2) Loss in green cover - The second is a loss in green cover, something that occurs as more people reside within the city, increasing soil erosion, risking the further vulnerability to landslides. - Due to the loss of green cover and steep gradient of the slope, water is not absorbed in the soil and washed away very quickly. #### 3) Damaged topography - The third is the unscientific manner of cutting hills for widening roads and construction. - This causes the sinking of roads, which affects road width and causes traffic interruptions. #### 4) Sewage failures - The fourth is the absence of a sewerage system in the area. Due to unavailability of sewerage systems, people construct septic tanks that are unsafe for soil strata. - Water from septic tanks drains to the upper layer of soil that has loose soil, making areas more vulnerable to damage from landslides. #### Also read > [The Northern and Northeastern Mountains \\| Part 1](https://www.civilsdaily.com/the-northern-and-northeastern-mountains-part-1/) **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Ambarnaya River **Mains level:** NA Russia has declared a state of emergency after a power plant fuel leak in its Arctic region caused 20,000 tonnes of diesel oil to escape into a local river, turning its surface crimson red. > Locate major rivers in Russia in the given map from east-west and west-east directions. #### Details of the spillage - The Ambarnaya River, into which the oil has been discharged, is part of a network that flows into the environmentally sensitive Arctic Ocean. - The state-owned TASS news agency reported that the emergency measures were announced within Russia‚Äôs Krasnoyarsk Region, located in the vast and sparsely populated Siberian peninsula. #### How did the leak happen? - The thermoelectric power plant at Norilsk is built on permafrost, which has weakened over the years owing to climate change. - The power plant is located near the Region‚Äôs Norilsk city, around 3000 km northeast of Moscow. - This caused the pillars that supported the plant‚Äôs fuel tank to sink. - Around 20,000 tonnes of diesel oil was released into the Ambarnaya river, which has since drifted 12 km on its surface. #### What has Russia done so far? - Boom obstacles were placed in the river, but they were unable to contain the oil because of shallow waters. - The state of emergency declared would bring in extra forces and federal resources for the clean-up efforts. #### What is the extent of the damage? - Environmentalists have said the river would be difficult to clean, given its shallow waters and remote location, as well as the magnitude of the spill. - This is the second-largest known oil leak in modern Russia‚Äôs history in terms of volume. - The clean-up effort could take between 5-10 years. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** NA **Mains level:** Extreme weather events in India and their mitigation Nineteen extreme weather events in 2019 claimed 1,357 lives, with heavy rain and flood accounting for 63 per cent of these deaths, revealed Down To Earth‚Äôs State of India‚Äôs Environment 2020 report. **Extreme weather events:** - Extreme weather events are out of the ordinary, unexpected, unusual climatic events which wreak havoc and disrupt everyday life. - Over the years, the frequency of extreme weather events has increased due to global warming and climate change. - Extreme weather events include hailstorm, heatwaves, dust storm, cloud bursts etc. > #### Try this question: > > Q.

Here is why this summer is slightly unusual. > Heatwaves being more frequent phenomena, the UPSC may end up asking a prelim as well as mains question about it. It may ask Q. What are heat waves and how are they classified? What are the external factors on which it is depended? > > A MCQ may be a statement based question mentioning the criteria for declaring a heatwave. #### What is a heatwave and when is it declared? Heatwaves occur over India between March and June. - IMD declares a heatwave event when the maximum (day) temperature for a **location in the plains** **crosses 40 degrees Celsius**. - Over the **hills**, the threshold temperature is **30 degrees Celsius**. **Following criteria are used to declare heatwave:** To declare heatwave, the below criteria should be met at least in 2 stations in a Meteorological subdivision for at least two consecutive days and it will be declared on the second day. #### a) Based on Departure from Normal - **Heat Wave:** Departure from normal is 4.5¬∞C to 6.4¬∞C - **Severe Heat Wave:** Departure from normal is >6.4¬∞C #### b) Based on Actual Maximum Temperature (for plains only) - **Heat Wave:** When actual maximum temperature ‚â• 45¬∞C - **Severe Heat Wave:** When actual maximum temperature ‚â•47¬∞C #### How long can a heatwave spell last? - A heatwave spell generally lasts for a **minimum of four days**. On some occasions, it can **extend up to seven or ten days**. - The longest recorded heatwave spell, in recent years, was between 18 ‚Äì 31 May 2015. - This spell had severely affected parts of West Bengal along with Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. - Heatwave conditions occurring in May have been observed to last longer, as the season reaches its peak this month. - Whereas those reported in June often die down sooner, often due to the onset of Southwest monsoon over the location or in its neighbourhood. #### Does all of India experience heatwave conditions? - Heatwaves are common over the Core Heatwave Zone (CHZ) ‚Äî Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Vidarbha in Maharashtra. - The CHZ also includes parts of Gangetic West Bengal, Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, as categorised by IMD. - Several recent studies indicate that CHZ experience more than six heatwave days per year during these four months. - Many places in the northwest and cities along southeastern coast report eight heatwave days per season. - However, the regions in the extreme north, northeast and southwestern India are lesser prone to heatwaves. #### Whats‚Äô so unusual this year? - Summer season reaches its peak by May 15 in India when the day temperatures across north, west, and central India cross 40 degrees and hover close to 45 degrees then on. - This year, north India did not experience such temperatures till May 21. - It was mainly because of the continuous inflow of Western Disturbances that influenced the weather in the north till as late as April. - Since last winter, there was frequent passing of Western Disturbances over the north, appearing after every five to seven days. #### What are these Western Disturbances? - Originating in the Mediterranean Sea, Western Disturbances are eastward-moving winds that blow in lower atmospheric levels. - They affect the local weather of a region during its onward journey. - Between January and March this year, there were about 20 Western Disturbances, a record of sorts. - When Western Disturbances interact with weather systems heading from the two southern seas, that is, warm winds blowing in from the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea, they cause snowfall or rainfall over the north. - A significant influence of Western Disturbances is experienced from December to February. However, this year, its influence persisted until early May. - The recent Western Disturbances got support from easterly winds blowing over from the Bay of Bengal. #### Has cyclone Amphan influenced the current heatwave? - Since the event of severe heat has emerged immediately after the passing of Cyclone Amphan, experts confirm its role in leading to the present heatwave spell. - Cyclone Amphan, which was a massive Super Storm covering 700 km, managed to drag maximum moisture from over the Bay of Bengal to entire Peninsula. - All the moisture that was otherwise built during the thunderstorm and rainfall got gradually depleted from over vast areas as the storm advanced towards West Bengal and Bangladesh between May 16 and 20. - It has now triggered dry north-westerly winds to blow over Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra causing severe heatwave. **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Locusts invasion **Mains level:** Locusts invasion and its threats Locusts normally arrive during July-October but have already been spotted in Rajasthan. At a time India is battling COVID, they present a new worry with their potential for exponential growth and crop destruction. > Along with being a disaster issue, Locust attack is also a challenge for India‚Äôs food security. Discuss what socio ‚Äì economic and technological ways can be adopted to tackle this menance. #### What exactly are Locusts? - The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is a short-horned grasshopper that is innocuous while it is in a ‚Äúsolitary phase‚Äù and moving about independently. - These winged insects differ from normal hoppers and become dangerous only when their populations build up rapidly and the close physical contact in crowded conditions triggers behavioural changes. - They, then, enter the ‚Äúgregarious phase‚Äù, by grouping into bands and forming swarms that can travel great distances (up to 150 km daily), while eating up every bit of vegetation on the way. - If not controlled at the right time, these insect swarms can threaten the food security of countries. #### How seriously should the first sightings be viewed? - The damage potential of locusts has been limited in India only because of the country hosting a single breeding season ‚Äî unlike Pakistan, Iran and East Africa, where they also multiply during January-June. - There‚Äôs nothing much to worry right now, as the rabi crop has already been harvested and farmers are yet to commence plantings for the new Kharif season. - The locusts‚Äô bands so observed are less populated. But their timing, though, is cause for concern. - The normal breeding season for locusts in India is July-October. But this time, they have been sighted by mid-April. - Last year, too, they were seen towards end-May as isolated grasshoppers. - The longer time to breed is more conducive for a build-up of gregarious insect swarms, as opposed to solitary, innocuous hoppers. #### Control measures in India - India has a Locust Control and Research scheme that is being implemented through the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), established in 1939. - It was amalgamated in 1946 with the Directorate of Plant Protection Quarantine and Storage (PPQS) of the Ministry of Agriculture. - The LWO‚Äôs responsibility is monitoring and control of the locust situation in Scheduled Desert Areas mainly in Rajasthan and Gujarat, and partly in Punjab and Haryana. - The LWO publishes a fortnightly bulletin on the locust situation. #### What kind of damage can they cause? - Locusts are polyphagous, i.e. they can feed on a wide variety of crops. - Secondly, they have the ability to multiply rapidly. A single female desert locust lays 60-80 eggs thrice during its roughly 90-day life cycle. - It is estimated that a 1-square-km area can accommodate 40-80 million of these insects, making the growth of their swarms exponential quite like the Covid-19 virus. #### What is the genesis of the present locust upsurge, particularly in East Africa? - It lies in the Mekunu and Luban cyclonic storms of May and October 2018 that struck Oman and Yemen, respectively. - These turned large desert areas in remote parts of the southern Arabian Peninsula into lakes, which allowed the insects to breed undetected across multiple generations. - The swarms attacking crops in East Africa reached peak populations from November onwards while building up since the start of this year in southern Iran and Pakistan. - Widespread rains in East Africa in late March and April have enabled further breeding. - Prior to that, the locusts from spring breeding areas of southwest Pakistan and southern Iran would arrive in Rajasthan and Gujarat during May-June. - They would, then, breed with the onset of the southwest monsoon rains and continue doing so through the Kharif cropping season. #### What can and should be done? - If the monsoon is good, and in the absence of control operations, the magnitude of attack could be worse than in the 2019-20 rabi season. - The last year‚Äôs locust incursions were the first and most significant since 1993. - Local authorities in Rajasthan and Gujarat had to treat over 4.30 lakh hectares of infested areas with sprayers mounted on tractors and other vehicles. #### Pesticides give better control - The old generation organophosphate insecticides such as Malathion (96% ultra-low volume aerial application) are effective against locusts. - About one litre of the chemical is necessary to treat a hectare of their breeding areas, including trees where they halt for the night. - There is ample stock of pesticides to control any swarms in India. #### Click here to read about the complete genesis of Locusts and their origin: > [Locust Invasions and its mitigation](https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/locust-invasions-and-its-mitigation/) **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Prelims level:** Styrene gas, Various acts governing hazardous chemicals **Mains level:** Loopholes in handling of Hazardous chemicals in India A gas leak has claimed at least 11 lives and affected thousands of residents in five villages in Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. The source of the leak was a styrene plant owned by South Korean electronics giant LG. > Practice question: > > Despite a robust policy framework governing the hazardous chemicals in India, the recent gas leakage incident in Vizag highlights India‚Äôs unaddressed vulnerability to chemical disasters. Criticallly comment. #### Vizag gas lead: What is styrene? - It is a flammable liquid that is used in the manufacturing of polystyrene plastics, fibreglass, rubber, and latex. - Styrene is also found in vehicle exhaust, cigarette smoke, and in natural foods like fruits and vegetables. - According to The Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989, styrene is classified as a toxic and hazardous chemical. #### What happens when exposed to styrene? - A short-term exposure to the substance can result in respiratory problems, irritation in the eyes, irritation in the mucous membrane, and gastrointestinal issues. - And long-term exposure could drastically affect the central nervous system and lead to other related problems like peripheral neuropathy. - It is, likely, a carcinogenic substance that can react with oxygen in the air to mutate into styrene dioxide, a substance that is more lethal. - However, there is no sufficient evidence despite several epidemiology studies indicating there may be an association between styrene exposure and an increased risk of leukaemia and lymphoma. #### What are the symptoms? - Symptoms include headache, hearing loss, fatigue, weakness, difficulty in concentrating etc. - Animal studies have reported effects on the nervous system, liver, kidney, and eye and nasal irritation from inhalation exposure to styrene. #### How bad is the situation in Visakhapatnam? - It is yet unclear whether the deaths are due to direct exposure to styrene gas or one of its byproducts. - However, hundreds of people including many children were admitted to hospitals. - The cases are high as the gas leak was only detected at 3 am in the morning, meaning several crucial hours have been lost till safety precautions were taken. - More fatally, the gas was leaked while people were fast asleep. #### What caused the leak? - Styrene monomer was used at the manufacturing plant to produce expandable plastics. - The storage requirement of styrene monomer strictly mentions that it has to be below 17 degrees Celsius. - There was a temporary and partial shutdown of the plant because of the nationwide lockdown. - The leak occurred as a result of styrene gas not being kept at the appropriate temperature. - This caused a pressure build-up in the storage chamber that contained styrene and caused the valve to break, resulting in the gas leakage. #### Is it under control? - The leak has been plugged and NDRF teams moved into the five affected villages and have started opening the houses to find out if anyone was stranded inside. - The Covid-19 preparedness helped a lot as dozens of ambulances with oxygen cylinders and ventilators were readily available. - The spread of the gas depends on wind speeds. So far it is estimated that areas within a five-kilometre radius have been affected. #### What are the guidelines on the storage of hazardous chemicals in plants? After the Bhopal disaster, much legislation was enacted starting from the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991.

Nuclear Liability Bill : \"Buckling under pressure\" from the BJP, the government on 11 August decided to incorporate several changes suggested by the Opposition in the civil nuclear liability bill and bring a redrafted legislation next week with the hope that the move would pave the way for its passage in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament itself (The Indian Express, SAP20100812534004).

Superbug From India : According to a report in The Lancet, scientists have tracked down a drug-resistant superbug that infects patients and causes multiple organ failure to Indian hospitals.

Before this meeting, Cameron called himself as a supporter of America. He said that UK and America have a mutual and clear agenda and some of the activities of the UK are based on these close relations. Cameron's visit to India and the extensive relations (with India) can be counted as a continuation of British policy to have strategic relations with that country. His views about Pakistan and the revelation of documents on the Afghan war, which happened simultaneously, are interesting points. In his trip, Cameron said that Pakistan is an exporter of terrorism to Afghanistan, India, and other regions of the world. It happened in a situation when the tense relations between India and Pakistan are evident to everyone. Most of the countries do not express their position against either of these two countries while they visit the other. Moreover, they have tried to maintain a balance between these countries and have even balanced their visits to India and Pakistan. According to the disclosed documents on America's war in Afghanistan, the intelligence agencies of Pakistan have cooperated with the Taliban. Though there is no clear reason as to why these documents were disclosed, there is a possibility that it was aimed at the pressurizing of Pakistan by the American authorities and the creation of a sense of responsibility in that country to fight against terrorism. The Americans have made this allegation through an intentional or accidental revelation of the documents. In his meeting with Obama, Cameron did not give any other example that could be more important than Afghanistan to describe the level of cooperation between London and Washington in favor of their national interests. This point proves two issues. One is that South Asia has become important for the British authorities. Second, the UK has understood that it needs to cooperate with the US in order to maintain its power and ability to manage world affairs. South Asia is a region that is under the focus of America and close cooperation between the US and UK on South Asian issues has obviously increased since Cameron became the British prime minister.

Qari Ziaur Rehman, a Kunar-based Taliban comma nder said, while talking to The News by telephone from an undisclosed location in Afghanistan, that it was really good news for us that NATO supply line through Pakistan has been cut because of devastating floods. Of course, we were extremely saddened by the loss of precious human lives and the colossal economic losses because of devastation caused by floods in Pakistan, he said. However, we were also very happy that NATO supply line had been cut, the Kunar-based Taliban commander said. The Taliban commander said that they were now in much better position in the ongoing Kandahar Operation of the US and allied forces in south Afghanistan. He said that NATO supplies, being transported through Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa and Balochistan Provinces of Pakistan, had been completely cut off by the floods. He said that it was very beneficial for us. A major military operation, the linchpin of McChrystal's strategy, was underway in Kandahar these days, using the bulk of 30,000 reinforcements sent by US President Barack Obama, the Kunar-based Taliban commander said. He said that, in spite of the holy month of Ramadan our operations and the attacks on the US and NATO forces as well as other foreigners, were not going to come down. He said: \"We are will continue with the same thrust. The Kunar-based Taliban commander said that the Taliban would soften their actions only to such an extent that they would not target the foreign women. He said that in addition to the US and NATO troops, a list of foreigners working in Afghanistan, including big businessmen of India, had been compiled for attacks. Zia added that the Indians were also our prime target because they were also close to the United States, and were doing good business in our homeland. He said that markets in major Afghan cities, particularly Kabul, Jalalabad, and Kandahar, were bursting with the Indian music CDs and cassettes because of the presence of Indian businessmen. Zia said that Indian culture was being promoted in Afghanistan with the connivance of Hamid Karzai, who as part of a well-knit plan wanted obscenity to prevail in Afghanistan like the 1970s. But the mujahidin would never let him do so, he added. (Description of Source: Rawalpindi Jang in Urdu  The War, an influential, largest circulation newspaper in Pakistan, circulation of 300,000.

However, the Bonn Conference elected Karzai as president. Thus, the National Alliance chief was isolated and the other components of the alliance, including the Tajik Panjshiris, secured posts in the Karzai government. In this way, the Northern Alliance was dismantled in early 2002 once and for all. During this time, Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani served as opposition leader. However, his closest colleagues in the Northern Alliance, such as Abdullah Abdullah, Younus Qanuni, and Marshal Fahi m, occupied important ministries in Karzai government. Similarly, Professor Sayyaf, Karim Khalili, and Rashid Dostum were also part of this government. When, at the dictate of the United States, Karzai removed Marshal Fahim and Younus Qanuni, they joined forces with the opposition. However, Abdullah still remained number two in the Karzai government. Later, when Karzai removed Abdullah, he also joined the opposition. However, now when Qanuni is the speaker of the National Assembly, Marshal Fahim has joined the Karzai camp, acquiring the post of vice president. Thus, not only the Northern Alliance but even its Panjshiri clique has disintegrated. After burying the alliance in 2002 forever, other parts of the alliance, such as Rashid Dostum, Professor Sayyaf, Karim Khalili, and Waheedullah Sabaon, are now with Karzai and against their former leader Professor Rabbani. In Afghanistan's politics and journalism, the word Northern Alliance has become obsolete sin ce 2002. Even the Taliban are not using this word for their opponents because they know that there is no alliance with this name in Afghanistan. However, it is ironic that the word is still being constantly used in Pakistani politics and journalism. The statements and decisions of every person who was in this alliance are being linked with the alliance. Policies are being made (in Pakistan) on the basis of a thing (Northern Alliance) that has no existence at all. Now, even some analysts have started to predict the disintegration of Afghanistan on the basis of this presumption. For their part, when seeing the word Northern Alliance in our statements and speeches, the politicians and journalists of Afghanistan ridicule us. Similarly, the statements of Amrollah Saleh, who was a colleague of Ahmad Shah Masud in the past, and was made the Afghan intelligence chief with the blessings of Britain, India, and the United States after 9/11, are being used as a basis for th e disintegration of Afghanistan. This is although Amrollah is not a political leader, nor is anybody paying heed to him in Afghanistan. He had importance as long as he was the Afghan intelligence chief. If any chief of a powerful agency, like the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence), cannot become a political leader in Pakistan after his retirement, then how can Amrollah Saleh becom e one in Afghanistan? However, using his boastful utterances as a basis for their analysis, some of our analysts are trying to prove the imminent division of Afghanistan. More ironic is the fact that these analysts introduce Saleh as the former adviser to the Afghan president for security, although he has never occupied this post. He was the chief of Afghan intelligence and Hamid Karzai removed him from the same position. Here the logic is very simple. If the division of Pakistan on ethnic grounds is (God forbid) possible, then the question of Afghanistan's division on these lines can certai nly be discussed.

That day draws nearer, sooner than expected because the country has accumulated an unsustainable debt of trillions of dollars in pursuit of aggressive designs, like the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. And, adding to the military's woes has been the economic crunch that is impacting the lives of American citizens and, thus, would not permit of such reckless spending much longer. Defence Secretary Robert Gates' proposal to reduce the size of the army by abolishing one of the ten commands to effect a saving of $100 billion over the next five years points to that compulsion. The recommendation, if accepted, would inevitably result in a reduced American presence in the region, apart from wider implications at the global political and military levels. Evidently, Washington's commitment in Afghanistan wo uld fall several notches lower, notwithstanding its declarations to the contrary, and so would its avowals of long lasting friendship with us. However, considering other developments that can be traced directly to American encouragement, there is not much ground for satisfaction for the people of Pakistan. The insistence on India playing a substantial role in Afghanistan as a stabilising force, once the US troops have left, forebodes more troubles for Pakistan. The plan is ill conceived; the Indian equation with the minority Northern Alliance would hardly please the Pashtun majority and would not be conducive to peace and stability in the country. For Pakistan, New Delhi's attempts at muddying the waters in Balochistan and FATA would suggest constant threats to its integrity. Islamabad must underline these dangers in contacts with US officials. The only good for us under the circumstances would be for the foreign occupation in Afghanistan to end and let the Afghans and, if n eed be, its Muslim neighbours - Pakistan, Iran and Turkey - to come forward and help. Secretary Gates' idea is based on the premise that the military has grown 'unwieldy and costly'. It would eliminate the Joint Forces Command that employs 5000 people, reduce the strength of Generals and Admirals by 50 and cut down the number of support contractors by 10 percent. Its acceptance, favoured by President Obama, is contingent upon approval by the Congress where it is likely to encounter opposition from members to whose constituencies the bulk of the employees belong.

We re-examined this policy starting late last year,\" said Holbrooke in a press briefing. Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced this week he planned to ask the United Nations to remove up to 50 former Taliban leaders from a terrorism blacklist.The Security Council Resolution 1267 was passed in 1999 and was designed because of Taliban noncompliance with certain United Nations resolutions. Holbrooke made clear that \"to get a name delisted takes Security Council approval, which means the five permanent members must do this, must agree\" and mentioned that he visited New York last week to talk to the Austrian ambassador to the U.N., who is in charge of this process for the U.N. Security Council, and to various other U.N. officials and to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.\"President Karzai would like to have names dropped from the list. We agree to do that on a case-by-case process. We will not support a blanket ending of this list,\" he added while stating that \"there are people on it who are dangerous threats to the United Sta tes and our allies, and there are people on it who are actors in movements which threaten to kill members of the coalition.\" Holbrooke affirmed that \"this is not a one-time-only event, it is an ongoing process, and the U.S. is not in charge of it. The U.N. is. But we are working on it, along with them.\" \"Our position on reconciliation should be equally clear. We support Afghan-led reconciliation,\" he added.Holbrooke affirmed that the Kabul conference on July 20 \"is not going to end the war in Afghanistan.\" The Afghan government is expected to present a plan to improve development, governance and security during a conference co-chaired by the United Nations. While it is not a pledging conference, donor countries are expected to align their assistance with the proposals put forward in the meeting.Assistant Secretary of State for public diplomacy Philip Crowley told reporters that a \"major element\" of Secretary of State Hillary Clint on upcoming trip is to participate in the Kabul conference next week.Holbrooke, who just came back from a trip to South East Asia, will leave again tomorrow for Germany, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India on addition to London on his way back to Washington. In Germany, he will meet with the coordinator for the international special representatives for Afghanistan and Pakistan group Michael Steiner. Holbrooke noted the participation of seven Muslim countries from the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in the Kabul conference highlights \"the importance of the fact that so many Muslim countries are participating in this effort.\" \"This gives the direct lie to the \"clash of civilizations\" theory which the Taliban and al Qaeda put out so continually,\" he added.Holbrooke said the US administration is continuing discussions with Islamabad on is relation with Kabul adding that this dialogue between the two neighboring countries \"is beginning to show signs of some degree of building some degree of mutual confidence.\" \"Nothing could be more important to the resolution of the war in Afghanistan than a common understanding between Afghanistan and Pakistan on what their strategic purpose is,\" he added. Holbrooke also stressed the importance of the meeting between the Indian and Pakistani foreign minister in Islamabad this week saying that this help \"reduces tensions and increases confidence and understanding between Pakistan and India is something we would encourage and support. But we are not directly involved in those talks.\"(Description of Source: Kuwait KUNA Online in English -- Official news agency of the Kuwaiti Government; URL: http://www.kuna.net.kw) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

However, the militants responded by opening firing towards the Army positions.The firing was retaliated by the troops, triggering off a fierce encounter that lasted several hours, they said adding three unidentified militants were killed in the gun battle.Srinagar-based Defence Spokesman Lt Colonel J S Brar confirmed the killing of militants but said further details about the operation were awaited.'In an operation in the dense Bandipora forests, our troops have killed three terrorists and recovered three AK rifles, 15 magazines and 480 rounds of ammunition besides other war like stores,\" Lt Col Brar said.The sources said it would take at least another 24 hours for the Army to bring down bodies of the slain militants and the weapons recovered from their possession to the nearest police station as scene of the encounter was deep inside the forest area, almost 45 kilometres from Bandipora.They said identification of the militants would take some time but they were believed to be affiliated with Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), which has a strong presence in the area.The success for the Army comes just two days after militants killed three policemen in Sopore area of Baramulla district in a daring attack on the police post guarding a local politician.Although the number of militants in north Kashmir has increased this summer following fresh infiltration from across the Line of Control (LoC), the ultras have suffered major setbacks during the past few weeks in Bandipora and Sopore areas, losing two of their top commanders.Ajmal Shah alias Abu Zarr, who was a self styled divisional commander of the LeT outfit, was killed in an encounter with security forces in Gaaroora area of Bandipora on July 19.On the very next day, security forces managed to eliminate Noman, who was involved in militancy for past six years and responsible for orchestrating the fidayeen attack at Lal Chowk earlier this year and several killings including that of a local militant commander Basharat Saleem in April.Although the militancy-related incidents in Kashmir valley have dropped this summer due to the ongoing agitation, security officials apprehend an upsurge in the militant attacks over the coming months.Meanwhile, Army recovered a cache of arms and ammunition from Sopore area in Baramulla district less than three days ahead of Independence Day celebrations.Troops of 29 Rashtriya Rifles and police recovered the cache of arms near Sangrama in Sopore area during a joint search operation.The recoveries included three AK rifles, five pistols with silencers, one Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher, two Under Barrel Grenade Launchers, 19 Improvised Explosive Devices, 30 Kgs of explosives, 11 grenades, two radio sets and a large quantity of stores.

Chidambaram in his May 11 letter.Swami Agnivesh had acted as a mediator between the Centre and the Maoists before Azad was killed by sleuths of the Andhra Pradesh State Intelligence Branch in Adilabad on July 2 in an encounter, which, the Maoists alleged, was fake.A credible judicial inquiry into Azad's death should be ordered by either the Centre or the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister to reflect the Centre's seriousness about the dialogue, said Swami Agnivesh.Swami Agnivesh said that once a judicial probe was ordered, he would ask the Maoists to announce a convenient date from which they would abjure violence for 72 hours so that the dialogue process could start.\"If not me, the Maoists could even contact writer Mahasweta Devi or social activist Debabrata Bandopadhyay and inform a specific date. They, however, should make it clear that the entire Communist Party of India (Maoist) is supporting the peace drive because the fact remains that the organisation has some dissident factions,\" Swami Agnivesh said.Immediately after receiving the truce offer, he contacted the Prime Minister's Office to seek an appointment for discussing the matter.

However, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has no plans at the moment to respond by canceling its visa-free privileges for Malaysian visitors, said Ger Bau shuan, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Taiwan has been granting visa-free treatment to Malaysian passport holders since 2002, while Malaysia has been offering landing visa privileges to Taiwan citizens since 2009. According to Ger, Malaysia's decision to stop issuing landing visas is part of its efforts to grapple with the increasingly serious problem of overstaying visitors from China, India and Bangladesh who have been abusing the system by working illegally in the country. Ger said Malaysia's decision applies to all countries around the world -- not just to Taiwan. He further said the Taiwan government has asked Malaysia no t to mistakenly put Taiwan on the list of countries whose citizens have been abusing the landing visa program. Ger said the MOFA will continue to hold talks with Malaysia to push for visa-free privileges for Taiwanese tourists. As a matter of fact, Ger said, few Malaysia bound Taiwanese visitors opt for landing visas because it is cheaper to obtain a Malaysian visa in Taiwan. Taiwanese citizens make more than 200,000 visits to Malaysia annually, Ger said.

Based on disposable income, the middle class steadily declined from 68.5 percent of households in 1996 before the Asia n financial crisis to 61.9 percent in 2000, 58.5 percent in 2006, and 56.7 percent last year. By contrast, the rate for the upper class rose from 20.2 percent in 1996 to 24.1 percent last year, and that of the poor also increased from 11.3 percent to 19.2 percent over the same period. Samsung Economic Research Institute also said the share of middle-income households dropped from 60.4 percent in 2003 to 55.5 percent last year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development defines the middle class as households that earn between 50 and 150 percent of a country's median income. The results of the two Korean think tanks based on the OECD's definition show that with a steep decline in the number of the middle class, middle-class people who became poor outnumbered those who joined the upper class. The collapse of the middle class has also plagued advanced economies such as the U.S., Japan and those in Europe. Japan, which had been considered a country wh ose population belonged to the middle-class, is now called a \"wealth gap society\" or \"lower-class society\" after a decade of economic stagnation in the 1990s. The U.S. and Europe also saw their middle-class populations decline as jobs in services and manufacturing migrated to China and India. Korea's middle class, however, has shrunk faster than any other country over the past decade after having posted steady growth since the 1960s. The middle class is the key to social stability. A burgeoning middle class helps social integration. By contrast, the rising number of middle-class people falling into poverty could ignite class conflict and social unrest and cause politicians to resort to populist policies. The fundamental and long-term solution to boost the middle class is economic growth. To this end, the government should simultaneously pursue the existing model of export-oriented growth along with raising domestic consumption. Another urgent task is to implement economic reform to nurture talent that can adapt to changing economic and industrial environments. Korea's average wage has almost reached the level of advanced economies. To increase the number of middle-class households, the creation of high value-added jobs is necessary. The shortest way to add quality jobs is deregulation in high-end service sectors such as medical care, education, law and tourism and removal of entry barriers in such sectors. Large corporations that raised sufficient funds through exports should be allowed to enter high value-added services and green growth industries. Blasting this as preferential treatment for such large corporations is an outdated perception. In his farewell ceremony, outgoing Prime Minister Chung Un-chan (Cho'ng Un-ch'an) said, \"Both a government that doesn't do what it must do and a government that believes it can do everything hurt the interests of the nation and people.\" What the Lee Myung- bak government must do is to restore the middle class and should shift its policy focus to achieve this task.

Her visa is valid till August 16 and has been extended by another year, official sourc es said.Her application for granting a permanent residency in the country has been hanging in balance for years together.Earlier, the Indian government had said that Taslima's visa cannot be extended beyond August 16, 2010, as her travel document had been issued under the category (miscellaneous).Taslima, a Swedish passport-holder, had sought visa under the miscellaneous category in 2005 and it has since been extended initially for a year and later for six months. The visa under this category cannot be extended beyond five years. She had been conveyed that she should seek fresh visa from a third country after which she could visit India again, the sources said.However, the writer community of the country and intellectuals from other parts of the world had made an appeal to the government for considering her case as a special one and extend her visa.Taslima, who has been in and out of the country after she was dramatically bundled out of the eastern Indian state of West Benga l in November 2007 in the wake of protests by radical Muslim groups, came from London in July and was immediately whisked away to a safe location.The writer, who shot to fame with her controversial book 'Lajja' in 1994, has been told that she could stay in some other country for a few days and later apply afresh for the visa under the same category, pending her request for a permanent residency in the country, the sources said.Taslima had earlier expressed her desire to visit Kolkata city but it was turned down on the ground that radical elements may try to harm her, the sources said.Taslima had earlier left India on March 18, 2008, for Sweden after she was kept at an undisclosed place here for more than four months. She had not been allowed to see any visitor during the period and described her confinement as \"a chamber of death\".Recipient of various awards, she was shifted from her Kolkata residence after violent protests in the eastern metropolis against her con troversial book \"Dwikhondito\" (divided into two). Certain references in the book had earned the wrath of some Muslim organisations which demanded that she be asked to leave the Left-ruled state.Taslima has lived in exile in many countries, including France, Sweden, the US and India, since leaving her home in Dhaka in a cloak of secrecy in 1994. During her stay in India in the last five years, she has periodically travelled abroad with the last trip being in August 2009.(Description of Source: New Delhi PTI News Agency in English ) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

In such a situation, the fence would have run through the town.However, Dhaka's concurrence is another instance of the new-found cosiness between the two nations since Sheikh Hasina's return to power.Assam Accord implementation minister Bhumidhar Barman told The Telegraph of the development while dwelling on the hurdles that are delaying the fencing of the border even 25 years after the Assam Accord was signed and the steps Dispur is taking to expedite the process.Sealing of the border is one of the important clauses of the tripartite pact signed by the Centre, Dispur and the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) in 1985.\"It is a major breakthrough in bilateral relations from Assam's point of view. It will help speed up the fencing work. We have been moving the Centre to get the dispute resolved for the past several years. We have now received permission to erect the fence within 150 yards of the international boundary in Karimganj town. Land is now being acquired for the fencing work to start very soon. We hope the other disputed stretch of 2.874km in the Latitila-Dumabari area of the district is also resolved at the earliest,\" Barman said.Sources said giving relief to a population of about 25,000 living along the border weighed heavily on the minds of Indian and Bangladeshi authorities when they agreed to a relaxation of the fencing norms.\"It shows a spirit of accommodation a nd flexibility on part of Dhaka. Karimganj was a sticky point between the two countries. The process to get the issue resolved gathered momentum after the 2005 tripartite meeting on the Assam Accord chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The ministry of home affairs and external affairs actively pursued the matter with Dhaka, which also wants a favourable response to areas in adverse possession of India,\" the source said.Karimganj deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu said a survey of the stretch was under way and would be completed by August for the National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) Ltd to erect the fence along the bank of the river.\"The fencing will help prevent cross-border influx and antisocial activities. It is a very positive development,\" he added.Echoing Angamuthu, a senior BSF official said a flag meeting was held recently with the Bangladesh Rifles to ensure that the fencing work proceeded smoothly. \"The decision was taken at the h ighest level between the two countries,\" he added.Assam shares a boundary of 267.330km with Bangladesh, of which 132km runs along Karimganj district.From 2006 onwards, central agencies have been assigned the work of constructing roads and fences and repairing fences that were completed in the first phase. The NBCC, National Projects Construction Corporation Ltd and the state PWD are in charge of erecting the fence.The residents hailed the development. Habibur Rahaman, a newspaper editor, said thousands of people would get a much-needed relief now that the issue had been resolved amicably.BJP legislator Mission Ranjan Das said the decision would spare thousands of dwellers of Karimganj town from living in a no-man's land as would have been the situation if the 150-yard norm had been maintained.

Mr. Chandra described the ties between Belarus and India as traditionally \"warm and cordial\" and emphasized the similarity of the two countries- views on regional and international issues and the importance of visits by high-ranking government officials and inter-parliamentary cooperation. Bilateral trade and economic cooperation is becoming more active, with Indian-Belarusian trade exceeding $600 million in 2009, Mr. Chandra said. The modernization of a power plant in Hrodna is one of the most important joint projects, estimated at $55 million, he said. An Indian delegation has recently arrived in Belarus to visit the plant, he noted. Other notable projects include the establishment of a training center for Belarusians at the High-Tech Park in Minsk, he said. A delegation of Indian businesspeople interested in buying and selling machine-building products will visit Belarus in October, Mr. Chandra said. In the fourth quarter of the year, a delegation of the state of Punjab will visit Belarus to discuss ways of developing cooperation in the agricultural sector and the farm produce processing industry, he said. Indian-Belarusian cooperation in the field of culture and education is excellent, Mr. Chandra said. About 100 citizens of India currently study at higher educational institutions in Belarus and about 500 Belarusians practice Indian dance styles in Minsk alone, he noted. In addition, he said, young Belarusian women visit Mumbai to perform in musicals and be cheerleaders at cricket games. Mr. Chandra called on Belarus to develop commercial tourism and noted that the facilities of Belarusfilm could be used to shoot both Bollywood movies and joint movies. The ambassador stressed that he was open for cooperation and urged journalists to help Belarusians learn more about India.

However, Taiwan's Minis try of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has no plans at the moment to respond by canceling its visa-free privileges for Malaysian visitors, said Ger Bau-shuan, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.Taiwan has been granting visa-free treatment to Malaysian passport holders since 2002, while Malaysia has been offering landing visa privileges to Taiwan citizens since 2009.According to Ger, Malaysia's decision to stop issuing landing visas is part of its efforts to grapple with the increasingly serious problem of overstaying visitors from China, India and Bangladesh who have been abusing the system by working illegally in the country.Ger said Malaysia's decision applies to all countries around the world -- not just to Taiwan.He further said the Taiwan government has asked Malaysia not to mistakenly put Taiwan on the list of countries whose citizens have been abusing the landing visa program.Ger said the MOFA will continue to hold talks with Malaysi a to push for visa-free privileges for Taiwanese tourists.As a matter of fact, Ger said, few Malaysia-bound Taiwanese visitors opt for landing visas because it is cheaper to obtain a Malaysian visa in Taiwan.Taiwanese citizens make more than 200,000 visits to Malaysia annually, Ger said.(Description of Source: Taipei Central News Agency in English -- \"Central News Agency (CNA),\" Taiwan's major state-run press agency; generally favors ruling administration in its coverage of domestic and international affairs; URL: http://www.cna.com.tw) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

Twenty-seven CRPF and state police troopers were killed in the encoun ter. The report has been forwarded to the Union home ministry.The casualties in the Dhaurai encounter were finally evacuated in a civilian helicopter chartered by Chhattisgarh police.The latest round in the bickering started in the thick of action last week. In blinding rain on Wednesday, a state police officer who had lost touch with base in the middle of a firefight climbed a hillock near Kirandul, about 30km from Dantewada, and over a weak signal radioed his superiors for reinforcements.More than two companies of security forces comprising Chhattisgarh police's Special Task Force and special police officers called the Koya commandos were on a mission to hit a Maoist hideout near the National Mineral Development Corporation's facilities.\"We asked for the CRPF Cobras (the special action teams of the Central Reserve Police Force) but they refused and said they will come only if Indian Air Force helicopters were ready to take them,\" a senior Chhattisgarh police offi cer said.The officer admitted that the state administration was panicky because 25 policemen who had returned to base had reported that another 75 troopers of their party, tasked to carry out a multi-directional assault on a hill, were missing. The forces were led by the deputy inspector-general, Dantewada, S.R.P. Kalluri. The two columns had lost radio contact in the rain.A senior CRPF officer said: \"We had readied two teams of Cobras at Polampalli (in Dantewada district) and in Jagdalpur (in Bastar) but the Indian Air Force refused to fly.\"The air force has four helicopters assigned for the counter-Naxalite operations in Bastar -- two Mi-17s, each capable of carrying more than 20 fully-equipped troops, and two Dhruv advanced light helicopters. But in a peculiar arrangement, the helicopters have been placed at the disposal of the central forces for 80 hours of flying time for all four choppers in a month.This means each helicopter can fly only 20 hours in a month -- or that each is permitted to fly sorties that last less than an hour a day.Contrary to reports from air headquarters in New Delhi, too, the IAF helicopters on counter-Maoist deployment are neither armed nor armoured. Officially, each of the helicopters has been assigned two Garud (IAF special forces) personnel. But often they cannot be taken on board to make space for either casualties, VIPs or security personnel of the central paramilitary forces.The security establishment also concluded that if the helicopters are armoured (armour-plated at the bottom) to withstand small-arms fire, they cannot carry enough personnel. Armour-plating increases the weight of the machine and makes it less manoeuvrable.The IAF doubts that the state and central forces in Chhattisgarh have sanitised helipads to ensure that they are beyond the range of small- arms firing by the Maoists.These reasons are unacceptable to the police who complain that the \"air warriors\" lead a life of rel ative luxury.\"Do you know, that unlike my men who live in the jungles battling not only Maoists but also a shortage of supplies and malaria, the IAF personnel get to live in air-conditioned quarters?\" an incredulous CRPF officer complained.An IAF officer in New Delhi cited two reasons for limiting th e flying hours. First, the IAF views its counter-Maoist deployment as a secondary task, its primary one being on the borders and in states where the military is involved in counter-insurgency (in Jammu and Kashmir and in the Northeast) and where the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is in force.For high-altitude border duties -- such as in Siachen (and currently to give relief in Leh) -- the helicopters have to be kept at maximum serviceability. The officer said the copters have to be \"rotated\", meaning that the same machine cannot be kept flying for multiple sorties.The IAF's helicopter fleet is less than fully operational. A report by the Comptroller and Audi tor General last week found that the force was able to meet only 74 per cent of its operational requirement.The fleet is ageing and about 78 per cent of the helicopters were being flown beyond their prescribed life. Between 2002 and 2007, the force has not inducted a single helicopter.The upshot was that \"serviceability\" (availability for sorties) was low and fluctuated between 45 per cent and 75 per cent.The IAF is currently recalling its helicopters on UN missions in Africa to bridge the gap.In Chhattisgarh and in the counter-Maoist operations that gap is translating into bodybags.

The US government hikes visa fees for Indian companies which employ more than 50% of H1B and L1 visa holders. President Barack Obama asserts that his policies will ensure American jobs do not any more go to China, India or Germany. Do these smoke signals a dd up to a serious crisis point for Indo-US relations?Probably not. These straws should be seen as nothing more than a political game which has marginal economic significance for the two countries. Indo-US business relations are nowhere near the brink, and they do not spell doom for either side immediately or in the future.It has been customary in India to read a little too much into every American posture in the business arena, but the time has come to treat American politicians in the same way that we do our ours -- with amusement, if not disdain. It is not surprising that American politicians make the usual loud and ineffective noises about saving American jobs. They are actually trying to save their own jobs.Schumer should have realised that chop shops do not hurt big economies like that of the US and the trouble lies elsewhere. He need not have looked beyond Detroit and the auto majors to understand the real problems of lagging American competitiveness.Similarly, the ri se is visa fees is more in the nature of a punitive measure because it will not help in creating the skilled workforce that America needs. If anything, it will only accelerate outsourcing instead of keeping those jobs in America. President Obama was indeed careful to emphasise that his policies were directed towards education and innovation which will strengthen the American economy instead of imposing direct protectionist measures.Whatever the rhetoric of globalisation, countries are playing the old game of everyone for himself. This is not likely to change. All that we can demand is that the game is played according to the rules, and losers should not cry foul every time things are not going their way.

Ahluwalia (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) said during Zero Hour.Demanding a response from the government, he said some foreign tourists after returning from India reported some infection and attributed it to Indian hospitals. \"It may not be true,\" he said.Ahluwalia, who was supported by Jayanthi Natarajan (Cong) (Indian National Congress), said there should be a system of maintaining a registry for patients suffering from infectious diseases.Natarajan said reports of superbug, attributable to India, is a \"wrong propaganda against the country\".Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Prithviraj Chavan said he would find out the facts from the health minister.According to a study publish ed in \"The Lancet Infectious Diseases\", a hospital-acquired superbug which cannot be treated by the existing drugs is originating from India.Indian medical tourism industry which is making rapid progress revolves around providing treatment and surgeries to global patients at significantly lower costs. The sector has been estimated at 1200 crore (one crore equals 10m) rupees.In a separate Zero Hour mention, Avinash Rai Khanna (BJP) expressed concern over the water level in the Bhakra Dam reaching towards the danger mark. He said Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana (northern states) and Rajasthan (western state) face the threat of floods.P. Rajeeve (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India - Marxist) said MPs (Members of Parliament) from Kerala (southern state) have staged dharna (protest) outside the house demanding clearance of the Kochi Metro project, which was to come up as a joint venture between the state government and the Centre (federal government).Mohan Singh (SP) (S amajwadi Party) demanded that a central (federal) team should visit eastern Uttar Pradesh (northern state) for assessment of the drought situation.M.V. Mysura Reddy (TDP) (Telegu Desam Party) expressed concern over spread of swine flu in Andhra Pradesh (southern state).Naresh Gujral (SAD) (Shiromani Akali Dal) demanded that the government should take up with Pakistan the problem of Sutlej river getting polluted from across the border.He said people in the Malwa region of Punjab are suffering from various diseases as lethal chemicals find their way into the river.(Description of Source: New Delhi PTI News Agency in English ) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

Shahidul Islam: War Crime Trial Dogged by Conflict of Laws \\- Holiday Online Thursday August 12, 2010 06:20:54 GMT Contrary to sweeping assertion that the government of Bangladesh lacks judicial mandate to embark upon the 1971 war crime trial, the lack of authority is not what undercuts the validation of such a trial. Rather, conflict of laws is what seems to be making the venture questionable, (and) controversial. Besides, the arrest of some suspects of the crime long before the framing of the charge has created a procedural breach under the 1973 International Crime Tribunal Act (ICT) itself. And, the Law Minister's recent assertion that the US and the UK have no business to poke their noses in the trial proceedings made things further worse. The Law Minister seems to be trying to make a scramble without breaking the egg. Whether one calls it war crime or crime against humanity, any trial relating to such crimes derives its authority from the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (GA Res. 260A, 1948), which reco gnized the principles and the judgments of the Nuremberg trail and made it an integral part of customary international law. The Convention also mandated that a competent tribunal of the state where the crimes took place could hold the trial, although most of the trials so far had taken place under an international panel tribunal to ensure neutrality and fairness. Despite the concerned UN Convention having proven controversial from the outset -- for its presupposition about the existence of an international government to try international crimes by an international panel -- the concurrent empowerment of concerned municipal government's aimed at overcoming that drawback. And due to such crimes involving trans-national parties, the Security Council (UNSC) removed the veil of ambiguity by creating an international tribunal on February 22, 1993 to conduct trial of genocide in former Yugoslavia. A similarly constituted court tried the Rwanda war crime trial in 1994 and issued in dictments. Conflict of laws The conflict of laws arises from the jurisdiction, mandate, applicable/conflicting laws, etc. Besides, procedural and legal fairness remains a central concern in such trials. For instance, death penalty may be an acceptable norm under the domestic law of some nations, including ours, but it is not permissible in many other countries or in the international crime tribunal. Secondly, although confessions taken under torture and other coercive means are not recognized as admissible evidence under the domestic and international laws, we have an exception in this regard too, albeit theoretically. Finally, absence of all the parties involved in the 'chain of the crime,' especially when the trial occurs under the municipal law of a particular nation may invalidate the legality of the entire trial proceedings by challenging its authority and fairness. In our instance, deprivation of right to appeal/judicial review, as was stipulated in the latest amendment to the International Crime Tribunal (ICT) Act of 1973, is blatantly contradictory to the equal rights afforded to every citizen in Article 27 of Bangladesh Constitution. This fundamental right can only be waived if the accused are not citizens of Bangladesh, which they are. Murky backdrop There is little doubt that the instances of war crime, genocide and other crimes against humanity were rampant and ubiquitous during Bangladesh war of liberation in 1971. Yet, our government failed to impress upon the UN to convene a special committee to legally authenticate the crimes' commission. Instead, the government of Sheikh Mujib promulgated Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order on January 24, 1972 for trial of 'domestic collaborators'. The crimes having originated from the order and command of people who ceased to be part of our nation as of the Proclamation of Independence Order in April 1971, the collaboration order turned into a weapon of prosecution against selective Bengali 'subordinates' of the Pakistani armed forces who had planned and directed the crimes' perpetration. This fundamental flaw was further compounded due to other legal inhibitions, compelling the Mujib regime to enact the First Amendment Act to the Constitution on 15 July 1973. The Act amended Article 47 of the Constitution by inserting an additional clause which allowed prosecution and punishment of any person accused of 'genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes and other crimes under international law'. That too failed to remove the legal inhibitions in their totality, due to the insertion of Article 47A which rendered inapplicable for the accused certain fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution. That has resulted in the passing of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act (ICT) on July 20, 1973. International agreements The ICT did relate such crimes as being the staples of international law, as they are suppo sed to be. The main obstacle proved to be the fate of some 30,000 captive Bengali soldiers (ranging from sepoy to three star generals) and non-combatants who awaited repatriation from Pakistan while Islamabad had serious concerns about the fate of some 90, 000 of its soldiers who had surrendered, pursuant to the Geneva Convention, to the Indian army on December 16 and awaited repatriation to Pakistan. Pakistan argued that it had followed armistice on December 16 under international laws of war, and, the absence of any certification by a competent UN-sponsored commission that the alleged war crimes constituted genocide had immune its forces from undergoing such a trial under the municipal law of Bangladesh. Tripartite agreement 1973 Pakistan also managed to convince India, within weeks, to sign (on August 28, 1973) a tripartite agreement in which India signed on behalf of Bangladesh. The agreement stated in clause V1 that \"Bangladesh agrees that no trials of t he prisoners of war shall take place during the entire period of repatriation and that pending the settlement envisaged in clause (V11) below these prisoners of war shall remain in India.\" Meanwhile, in order to obtain formal recognition from Pakistan and other Muslim countries -- as well as in deference to the tripartite agreement of 1973 - the government of Bangladesh declared a general amnesty on November 30, 1973 for those collaborators 'not yet charged with specific allegations of war-related atrocities'. The Press Note on general amnesty categorically said, \"Those who were punished for or are accused of rape, murder, attempts to murder or arson will not come under general amnesty.\" This resulted in the release from prison of some 26,000 detainees, out of 37,000 suspected collaborators who were apprehended and processed for trial in the aftermath of the war. Minister's arrogance The political changeover of 1975 having restored judicial fairne ss in the amended Constitution, about 11,000 suspected collaborators took recourse to appeal reviews and got released. The Collaboration Order itself was repealed on December 31, 1975 and the file closed, in order to move ahead with a renewed spirit of national reconciliation. Despite that being the backdrop, our Law Minister managed to antagonize two of the friendly international partners of development - USA and UK - by stating lately that they had no business of poking noses in the war crime trial. The comment displayed a bad mix of ignorance and arrogance, and defied the very rationale of the trial due to the crimes involving resolution and 'closed transactions' reached through international agreements, armistice and repatriation-related conditionali ty signed after the conclusion of the 1971 war, as well as the affordability and the accessibility of the accused to a varied mix of fundamental rights outlined in the relevant International Human Rights Charters of which Bangladesh is a signatory. UN, relevant bodies The UN and other relevant international governments and organizations thus have a moral compulsion to ensure that the trial is procedurally and legally fair and the rights of the accused are respected to the fullest extent. That is precisely why the government requested the UN in September 2009 to dispatch a team to Dhaka to advice on the technicalities of the war criminals trial. The USA and the UK are permanent members of the UN Security Council. The Law Minister's assertion also stands in stark contrast with the amendments brought to the 1973 ICT on July 9, 2009, whereupon the accepted definition of 'armed forces' now means the forces raised and maintained under the Pakistan Army Act 1952, the Air Force Act 1953 and the Navy Ordinance of 1961. That effort too aimed at ensuring the legal and the procedural fairness of the trial itself. More amendment needed Instead of showing arrogance, the government m ust reconsider to amend the 1973 ICT further due to the latest amendment having inserted a very objectionable clause that allows trial of individuals for war crimes 'even if they are not member of an 'auxiliary force' created under the Pakistan Armed Forces Act(s)' cited above. This particular clause does not obey the rules with the stipulations of the 1949 Geneva Convention and many other Protocols in which the stature of a person in the hierarchy of command is viewed as being determinative of whether that person has had command responsibility, or, the blame should be attributed to the civilian masters of the military and/or other auxiliary forces under their command. Historically, every war crime trial dealt with two questions in particular: whether (1) compliance of order from superior officers serves as a defence for the accused, and, (2) how far the command responsibility traverses up the chain of command? When things are so complicated, our government should strive to ensure that the conflict of laws are addressed, international agreements are complied with, and concerned international organizations and the governments are allowed to play a decisive role in ensuring the legal and procedural fairness of the trial.

Therefore, whatever decisions may be made in this meeting, they will have no authenticity; nor can the situation in Kashmir be improved through these decisions. If Manmohan Singh is desirous of improving the situation in Kashmir, he should march toward a permanent solution, instead of patching up the situation, something that will allow the implementation of UN r esolutions. It is quite obvious that all the efforts made by the Indian interior minister to stop the protest have failed; and now the Indian prime minister is attempting to put out the fire sparked by the violent acts of the Indian security forces in occupied (Indian-administered) Kashmir. This attempt will not succeed, because it is not a concrete solution to the problem.\" Islam Argues Kashmiris Deserve Full Support of Islamic World The Islam daily comments in its editorial: \"The reports received from occupied Kashmir tell new stories about the Kashmiris' passion for freedom. The Indian occupying forces have imposed a curfew in the valley for many days in order to overcome the struggle of the lovers of freedom. However, as soon as the curfew is relaxed, Kashmiri youths, children, old people, and women come out onto the roads in protest against the Indian atrocities. Mir Waiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, has said that tal ks will not be held with India on anything less than the right to self-determination. The Kashmiri people and leaders not only deserve appreciation for waging a freedom struggle against the Indian imperialists for 30 consecutive years, but they also deserve the full support of the Islamic world.\" The daily further writes: \"The need of the hour is that Pakistan should highlight the issue of Kashmiris' right to self-determination at the international level and efforts should be made to gain the full support of the Islamic world in this regard. In addition to the government, the Pakistani media also should prominently present the Kashmiris' freedom struggle. Along with this, Indian atrocities and secret activities, which are based on conspiracies and aggressive designs, should also be unveiled.\" Ummat Argues Peoples of Both Countries Desire Durable Peace Between Pakistan, India The Ummat daily comments in its editorial: \"The peoples of both countries desire durable peace between Pakistan and India. The Indian foreign secretary believes that it is difficult to find a way for that. This is an expression of Indian insincerity. Otherwise, the atmosphere of solidarity and harmony between Pakistan and India can be created by accepting the reality of Pakistan from the core of the heart and by resolving the Kashmir issue in accordance with the UN resolutions and the established international principles of justice. As a result, both countries can rid their people of poverty, hunger, ignorance, and disease and set them on the road to prosperity. They have so many natural resources that they can leave several major developed countries behind through mutual cooperation. Extremist Indian leaders have kept themselves and their people under the delusion for the last six decades that, through the passage of time and with the cooperation of international forces, Pakistan will be weakened so much that it will be forced to surrender to Indian hegemony.\" The daily further writes: \"The United States, the United Kingdom, and India all are adamant on the point that Pakistan should not promote terrorism; meanwhile, India, itself is involved in the worst form of state terrorism in occupied Kashmir. The entire world knows that Pakistan is the greatest victim of terrorism and it is making efforts beyond its power to wipe out this curse. Then, why does not the international community, including India, not extend full and conclusive cooperation to Pakistan, instead of leveling accusations?\" Jasarat Article Condemns Zardari Over UK Tour In his article entitled \"When Will People Pick Up Shoe?\" Muzaffar Ejaz comments: \"See, the television channels have once again been blocked. The psychology of all those engaged in the struggle for freedom of expression, champions of democracy, military dictators, and political and non-political leaders is the same: as long as the freedom of expression is against others, it is freedom of expression; as soon as the freedom of expression turns toward oneself, it becomes overstepping the limits and conspiracy and politics in the name of the flood and so on. Earlier, it was said: 'Do not throw stones at us; we are not wearing bangles.' Now, it is said the politicians should know that the jialas (Pakistan People's Party workers) also wear shoes. A whole debate is taking place as to whether this incident did or did not take place. Since there is no coordination in the government ranks and everyone has got his wires crossed, everyone has become a self-appointed spokesperson of the party or the person. Farhatullah Babar states: 'I do not know of any such incident, even though I was sitting very close (to President Zardari).' Fauzia Wahab is the spokesperson of heaven knows who. She said the information minister has not confirmed that a shoe was hurled at the president. However, along with her, La w Minister Babar Awan has reported that those who engage in shoe politics should know that jialas also wear shoes. In other words, the shoe was indeed hurled; whether or not it hit is not known. However, just as Bush shamelessly said that neither of the shoes hit, the president's spokesperson is saying that it did not hit; indeed, it was not hurled at all. Therefore, in this context, Fauzia Wahab is right in saying that the information minister has not confirmed it. The information minister himself has said the best thing. He said that the Pakistanis living in the United Kingdom have appreciated the president's tour. He did not explain that.\" Ejaz continues: \"However, the television channels that have been closed down and that have not been closed did show the appreciation of the president's visit: the Pakistanis were appreciating him outside the hall during the president's add ress in Birmingham. On the other hand, Shamim Khan, who was sitting inside the hall, took off his shoes from his feet in profuse appreciation. That is what is done in respect; shoes are taken off. Since Shamim Khan was overpowered by emotions, he took off shoes and tossed them at the president in protest. What is the fault of the television channels about this? Bush's shoe was made a game. However, when a shoe was hurled at our own president because of his mistake, why have the television channels been closed down?\" Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

The issue relating to the fishermen's conflict with the Indonesian navy is an issue that has remain unresolved for t he past 20 years.

However, the CRPF men had been posted to \"maintain law and order\" and did not have any \"clue about how the duo looked like\", po lice sources said.While Manoj left the procession and disappeared into the forest just 2km from the rally site, Asit hovered near the BDO's office in Lalgarh bazaar, half a kilometre from the venue, for about an hour before slipping away. Along the way, they spoke to the media and even allowed themselves to be photographed. While committee secretary Manoj is wanted for murder and arson, Asit is an accused in the Jnaneswari Express sabotage case.Police officers admitted that the CRPF personnel posted along the Jhitka forest could have arrested the duo had there been someone to identify them. \"We had to concentrate on the ground where Mamata was holding her meeting and could not place intelligence officials or local policemen on all the roads leading to Lalgargh,\" an officer said.Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh had said that wanted committee leaders would be arrested if they were seen at Mamata's rally. At Writers' Buildings yesterday, Singh said: \"We re these two people (the Mahato duo) near the dais or the stage? What can we do if somebody is seen in a village? We can't deploy our men there.\"A West Midnapore official said: \"The audacity with which the two wanted PCPA leaders roamed about openly near the rally ground should embarrass the cops. They almost dared the police to arrest them.\"An officer said the police had tracked the whereabouts of Manoj and Asit by monitoring their cellphone calls on the day of the rally. But nothing was done thereafter as everyone was too busy with Mamata's visit.\"Our first priority was to ensure the safety and security of Mamata Banerjee,\" an officer said. \"Arresting Manoj and Asit was not something we were overly concerned with.\"Police officers admitted in private that they had no intention of \"going on an arresting spree\" before the rally as it could have caused law-and-order problems with so many committee supporters around.Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore superintendent of police, said: \"Since Manoj Mahato had announced that he would be present at the meeting, arrangements were made at the venue to initiate lawful action against him. It is difficult to spot an accused if he melts into hundreds of supporters.\" (Description of Source: Kolkata The Telegraph online in English -- Website of Kolkata's highest circulation English daily, owned by ABP Group, with a flagship publication Anandabazar Patrika in Bengali.

At the moment, Barack Obama appears to have nothing but the mid-term elections in mind. It is crucial for the president of the United States of America to lead his party to a respectable victory in the polls. But he must tread the populist path with caution. True, the measure to raise visa fees for skilled workers, passed by the Senate, will please many in the US if it eventually becomes law. Two years ago, Americans had chosen Mr Obama as their president, expecting him to save them not only from George W. Bush but also from an economic downturn as bad as the Great Depression of the 1930s. For Mr Obama, in spite of all his rhetoric of fairness, one major way of creating employment is by reducing the number of foreign nationals working in the US. With the steep hike in visa fees, he has finally set out to clear more space for domestic workers.Obviously, Mr Obama's policy would be damaging for Indian information-technology companies that are major players in the US market. These firms temporarily place a section of their employees in the US to offer on-shore services. In the process, they pay nearly $1 billion in social security for their workers. An additional cost of $200-250 million, which is what the increment will entail if it comes into effect, will discourage Indian companies to continue operating out of the US. And ironically, it is the US that will suffer the greater loss. Not only will it have to relinquish access to cheap labour supplied by the Indian IT sector, but also forsake a huge amount that is paid to it as social security, which Indian workers never stay back to reap the benefits of. I ndian firms, though facing a bad deal, may carry on business in the same way, given the advantages of this age of super-connectivity -- Skype and video-conferencing could replace on-site services. What is worse is the evident discriminatory tilt in Mr Obama's plan. The revised visa rates apply only to companies with less than 50 per cent US workforce. So a US firm meeting the stipulation will be able to bring workers from India at half the cost while Indian companies bear the brunt of the new regulations. A biased policy such as this was least expected of a man who had been globally hailed as a messiah of equality. At any rate, trade cannot flourish, especially in this age of free market, if restrictions on the free movement of labour are not lifted.

Although the Trinamool has described the rally as ' apolitical' in which participants included activists and ordinary villagers, the role of the People's Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA) in organising it is hard to ignore. Senior PCPA leaders were seen in the vicinity of the rally.Many in the audience were said to be PCPA activists. Reports from the rally venue say that for all practical purposes this was a joint Trinamool-PCPA rally. The PCPA is believed to be behind the derailment of the Jnaneswari Express that resulted in a train collision that left over 150 people dead. It is widely regarded as a Maoist front organisation. Mamata is a cabinet minister and her party is a constituent of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government which has banned the Maoists and is currently engaged in operations against them and their front organisations. Her participation in the PCAPA rally was therefore irresponsible.Some of the comments that Mamata made in her speech are quite at variance with the position of the governme nt she is a part of. She has called for a halt to security operations in the Jangalmahal area. She also described the recent killing of Maoist spokesperson Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad as a murder. Differences between constituents of a coalition government are understandable but the charges she is levelling are serious. If she does harbour such serious policy differences with the UPA, she should step down. Else, she is guilty of running with the hare, even as she hunts with the hound. Her departure from the NDA stemmed from her opposing stance on various policy issues.It has been apparent for some time now that Mamata is propping up the Maoists. She is determined to defeat the ruling Left Front in West Bengal and is drawing on Maoist support for the upcoming electoral battle. Mamata is playing a dangerous game. The massive crowd the PCPA was able to rustle up for her rally might have impressed voters.But PCPA/Maoist backing will not be without a price. Is she considering me eting their demands if elected to power? Her short-sighted approach of using the Maoists in her fight against the Left may well boomerang on her. It is time the UPA broke its enigmatic silence and demanded more responsible behaviour from her.

If they are not neutralised the situation would go out of control, said director-general of police R.R.

He said the inter-state operations by Andhra Pradesh and Karantaka recently averted a major threat to the life of politicians an d police officials by the Maoist action teams. Mr Kumar said, \"The problem of left-wing extremism in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is not as serious as it is in Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Jharkhand. But there are secret cells and frontal organisations operating in these southern states.\" It was decided in the meeting that heads of intelligence agencies of four states handling left-wing extremism should meet once in six months for exchange information and also real time information has to be gathered from time to time. The information on rehabilitation of surrendered extremists, compensation to the naxal victims, rewards shall be shared with states' nodal officers.The DGPs also agreed upon sharing of photographs and details of Left-wing extremists, terrorists and other organised criminals on day-to-day basis.The one-day conference at Jubilee Hall was attended by Kerala DGP Jacob Punnoose, CID DGP of Karnataka D.V.

Krishna said Thursday (12 August).Replying to supplementaries (supplementary questions) during Question Hour in Rajya Sabha (upper house of Indian parliament), Krishna said there was uninterrupted dialogue from 2004 till the Mumbai terrorist attack. \"The attack in Mumbai was a point where we had to discontinue the composite dialogue,\" he said.\"India will be willing to hold sustained dialogue with Pakistan\" if the Islamic nation was to guarantee that its \"soil is not going to be directed for terrorist attacks (against India) and foment anti-India feelings,\" he said.\"The biggest confidence-building measure that Pakistan can do is to prevent any future terrorist attack (on India) and prevent speeches made by jihadi forces,\" Krishna said.\"We would like to have friendly, cordial and cooperative relations with Pakistan,\" he said.The prime ministers of the two countries had in Thimpu identified trust def icit as the impeding factor which needed to be bridged.Meeting of foreign secretaries and foreign ministers of the two countries was decided as one of the steps to lessen trust deficit.\"Our effort has been to fulfil that mandate given to us by the prime minister,\" he said.Krishna said India considers Hafiz Sayeed, leader of Jamaat-ud-Dawaa (JUD) - a Pakistani organization having links with Lashkar-i-Toiba, as the mastermind of the Mumbai attack.\"Unfortunately, Pakistan becomes subjective whenever we bring Hafiz Sayeed and others in discussion,\" he said. \"We certainly would like Pakistan to be helpful and cooperative with India so we can live in peace with each other.\"\"The fulfilment, in letter and spirit, of the solemn commitment given by the leaders of Pakistan, at the highest level, of not allowing territory under Pakistan's control to be used for any terrorist activity directed against India, would be the biggest confidence-building meas ure,\" he said.Krishna said he had in his talks with foreign minister of Pakistan on 15 July stated that any further terrorist attack on India emanating from Pakistani soil would cause immense harm to the normalization process.He called for \"credible and firm action against terrorist groups and their leaders, like the JUD and Hafiz Sayeed, who continue to incite violence against India.\"Krishna said he conveyed India's willingness to have further interaction on pressing humanitarian issues \"as part of a step-by-step, graduated and forward-looking approach to expanding dialogue to cover all issues of mutual interest and concern.\"There are 582 Indian fishermen in Pakistani jails and, likewise, there are 412 Pakistani fishermen in Indian jails, he said, adding, New Delhi wants to hold dialogue on early release and repatriation of prisoners and fishermen in jails in both countries, promotion of trade and commerce and greater people-to-people contact.During the 15 July dialogue in Islamabad, the foreign minister of Pakistan assured that his country will do everything in its power to fulfil the commitment of not allowing its territory to be used for terrorism against India.Besides, he gave an assurance that the investigation in the Mumbai terrorist attack case, taking into account the additional information obtained from the recent interrogation of David Headley, would be pursued vigorously to unravel the full conspiracy and bring all the perpetrators to justice, he said.\"The detailed and frank discussions held during the visit enabled both the countries to develop a better understanding of each others' position and points of view on various issues,\" he said.\"Despite differences of opinion on the way forward on a few issues, there was a broad understanding on a number of other issues,\" he added.(Description of Source: New Delhi PTI News Agency in English ) Material in the World News Connection is gene rally copyrighted by the source cited.

But then, matters in Kashmir have never resided strictly within the bounds of the ordinary and the expected. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had to intervene in the crisis not only because the credibility of the state government in Jammu and Kashmir is in a shambles, but also because very few voices, even within the state, have carried Mr Singh's sincerity and openness. The prime minister's address to the people of the valley in Urdu should have also made plain the earnestness of his desire to reach out to those who have been most affected by the incessant violence. In his political message, Mr Singh naturally talks about addressing the \"alienation and emotional needs of the people\".The success of any communication, however, depends on how well it is received -- and there are problems here. The ascendancy of the secessionists means that the prime minister's message may not reach the people undistorted. The hard-line Hurriyat leader, S.A. Shah Geelani, has already rejected Mr Singh's peace offer, and the moderate Hurriyat leadership of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is in no position to overturn that verdict. But the recalcitrance of the Hurriyat leadership or the stubborn refusal of the valley's mainstream political parties to amplify the Centre's peace message may not be the only problem. Mr Singh has talked about a political solution within India's Constitutional framework, one that would be subject to the political and economic realities of the time. This is not an entirely unique solution. From the limited autonomy of the National Conference to the sovereign \"azaad riyasat\" of the People's Democratic Party, ideas for Kashmir's future have swung wildly without ever reaching any concrete form. The Centre, most certainly, cannot impose a structure without internal consultation, which today seems no easier than it was yesterday, for it also involves sustained dialogue across the border. All plans, again, have demilitarization as their starting point, and this is not necessarily the case with Mr Singh's vision. There is another caveat that his message seems to have overlooked. How will the granting of autonomy to Kashmir look from the northeast of India, a region with as tortured a history as that of the valley?

Narsimha Reddy, alias Gaganna, who was arrested from Nawadih in Bokaro last week, has revealed that more than four dozen women were part of the rebels' army in Jharkhand, but not a single one of them was from the Mahto community.All the girls, he alleged, were either tribals or belonged to scheduled castes, a trend being followed by the Maoists in all t he other states.Reddy said if it was the Mahtos in Jharkhand, it was the Yadavs in Bihar and the Reddys and Raos in Andhra Pradesh who were members of local area committees that had exclusive rights to collect levy.\"If this is the way the rebels continue to function where tribals and those belonging to lower castes like Manjhi, Bhuiyan, Ganju and Kharwar would work for the armed wing to fight security forces, while the upper castes collected levy, the Maoists will have to pay a heavy price in the coming days,\" Reddy said during interrogation by senior police officers including IG (operations) R.K. Mallick, CRPF DIG Alok Raj and Bokaro SP Saket Singh.\"A revolt is now a distinct possibility,\" added Reddy.Reddy claimed local villagers, along with disillusioned young Maoists, were getting close to the police. That was the reason behind his own arrest and that of cadres like Anuradha Sharma, Ravi Sharma and Mohammad Hussain, alias Anna, that had left a vacuum within the Maoists leadership in Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand.In fact, Reddy claimed he was made in-charge of the Jharkhand sub-committee in 2007 and sent to the Palamau and Latehar areas to try and stem the tide of villagers turning against them.Reddy admitted there were serious differences between the Maoists' central leadership and its sub-area committees and said that on several occasions junior cadres had openly refused to toe the line.Reddy, who was lodged in Tenughat jail, was brought to Bokaro yesterday for interrogation after he was remanded to the custody of the district police. He will be questioned for the next two days by the senior police officers.Bokaro SP Saket Singh said Reddy also revealed several names. Those entrusted with collecting levy were Rajesh Mahto, alias Saranda Tiger, Ramchandra Mahto, Santosh Mahto, Ajai Mahto, Udai Mahto, Dharmendra Mahto, Nago Mahto and Bhuvneshwar Mahto.And those who were part of the armed squad that was forbidden from colle cting levy, were Navin Manjhi, Kundan Pahan, Ravi Manjhi, Pravir Manjhi, Pratiram Manjhi, Misir Besra, Pandu Manjhi (arrested) and Varun Manjhi.

Andhra Pradesh DGP R.R. Girish Kumar briefed his Tamil Nadu counterparts about the measures to be adopted to contain extremist activity.\"There was a presumption that there is a Maoist network over there.

Accompanying illustration This belt, geographically known as Schuppen belt, yielded results, and ONGC began production in March 1981. The oil giant estimated a geological reserve of 110 million barrels of oil with a recoverable reserve of approximately 1,600 barrels per day.Work, however, came to a halt in May 1994, following militant threats after extraction of a mere 7 million barrels of oil.Though production stopped and ONGC left Champang, fields continued to spout oil which seeped into the soil, rendering acres of farmland barren.Rivers and streams in the lowland are as were contaminated, affecting aquatic life.With crude petroleum staining large swathes of Champang, villagers fear that even a splinter could lead to a devastating fire.The landowners of Champang said there has been unabated spillage of petroleum for more than a week.\"But the state government has not done anything to contain the spillage and clean up the area,\" M. Yanathung Ngullie, president of Landowners' Union of Champang, said.The director of geology and mining, H.K. Chishi, said his department was concerned with the leakage and had sought immediate intervention by ONGC but his pleas had gone unheeded.The state government does not have adequate technology to stop the leakage, he said.The roads and bridges leading to Champang are in such bad condition that ONGC finds it difficult to transport heavy machinery to the area, he added.Champang villagers have other grievances too.Very little of the oil royalty has gone into local development, they allege.ONGC has pa id a royalty of Rs 33.83 crore to the Nagaland government, but of that only Rs 67 lakh reached the village.Talks, however, are on between the state government and ONGC to resume operations for exploration and production of petroleum products in Champang oil fields.

Katoch told PTI.He said the ministry will examine the issue in detail but it was \"unfortunate that this new bug, which is an environmental thing, has been attached to a particular country, which is India in this case\".\"I am surprised,\" he said, adding that, \"this (the bug) is present in nature. It is a random event and cannot be transmitted\".Katoch said that he was surprised that a research paper linked it with India as they should know it was a biological phenomenon.According to a paper published in scientific journal \"Lancet\", the new superbug, which is said to be resistant even to most powerful antibiotics, has entered UK hospitals, and is travelling with patients who had gone to countries like India and Pakistan for surgical treatments.Bacteria that make an enzyme called NDM-1 or New Delhi-Metallo-1, have travelled back with NHS (National Health Service) patients who went abroad to countries like India and Pakistan for treatments such as cosmetic surgery, it said.Although there have only been about 50 cases identified in the UK so far, scientists fear it will go global.NDM-1 can exist inside different bacteria, like E coli, and it makes them resistant to one of the most powerful groups of antibiotics - carbapenems.These are generally reserved for use in emergencies and to combat hard-to-treat infections caused by other multi-resistant bacteria.At least one of the NDM-1 infections the researchers analysed was resistant to all known antibiotics.Similar infections have been seen in the US, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, and international researchers say that NDM-1 could become a major global health problem.Infections have already been passed from patient-to-patient in UK hospitals.Dr David Livermore, one of the researchers and who works for the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA), said: \"There have been a number of small clusters within the UK, but far and away the greater number of cases appear to be associated with travel and hospital treatment in the Indian subcontinent\".The Department of Health has already put out an alert on the issue, he said.(Description of Source: New Delhi PTI News Agency in English ) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

This was reported by the Indian television station Times Now with reference to unnamed sources. The report emphasizes that aircraft produced by Russia, the United States, and Sweden did not make it into the number of finalists, following the prosecution of a series of flight tests. The customer did not negotiate engines for the Russian \"4++\" generation MiG-35 fighter aircraft, Swedish Gripen (producer: SAAB) withdrew, due to its radar, and the F-16, produced by the American concern Lockheed Martin, was also declared an aircraft completely \"without a future.\" The reasons were not indicated in the report in regard to the removal of the F-18 Super Hornet, developed by Boeing, from the list of finalists. This information was not confirmed by OAK. Konstantin Lantratov, press secretary for OAK, reported to Kommersant that \"official results of the tender have not yet been announced.\" He had refused to comment on the television station's unofficial information. Mikhail Pogosyan, first vice president of OAK and head of MiG RSK, told Kommersant yesterday that \"the MiG-35 has not been removed from the tender. I do not have any official information about that.\" A Kommersant source close to MiG RSK confirmed that, on Saturday, when the Indian television station made public information on the intermediate summary of the tender, it had not yet been given out. The Kommersant source, having specified that the MiG-35 tests, with the participation of the Indian side, were concluded back in the fall of last year, noted that \"envelopes with the proposals are to be revealed by the tender commission only this week.\" Nevertheless, many Kommersant sources in the market are speaking of objective problems with the MiG-35, connected to insufficient financing of the project, due to the fact that the only potential customer for the aircraft is the I ndian Air Force. A Kommersant source close to the Rosoboroneksport FGUP (Federal State Unitary Enterprise), stated that OAK President Aleksey Fedorov put foward the issue of the necessity for state allocations of supplementary financing for the MiG-35 project back at the end of 2008. However, the problem was not resolved. In his opinion, one of the key problems is the debugging of the RD-33MK engine for the MiG-35. The Kommersant source, while refusing to specify the current time between overhauls for the RD-33MK, noted that \"the time between overhauls for the engine should be 2,000 hours, and the overall service life 4,000 hours. But the engine is currently falling short of these indicators.\" The Kommersant source in the Russian-Indian intergovernmental commission noted that the report of Russia's ouster from the Indian tender has come about on the eve of the next session of the intergovernmental commission, which will begin on 30 August. He did not e xclude that, in this manner, the Indian side could be hinting at the necessity to improve the offer from the Russian participant in the tender. The advantage of the Russian proposal is in that the MiG-35 is the cheapest of the aircraft being presented for the tender. In the estimation of Konstantin Makiyenko, an expert from the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the much more expensive Rafale costs in the order of 60 million euros ($79.5 million), while the cost of the MiG-35 is \"a little more than $40 million.\" Oleg Panteleyev, head of the Aviaport analytical service agency, presumes that, \"the relationship of the combat capabilities and the price will unconditionally be one of the primary criteria for the acceptance of a decision by the government.\" He added that the strong suit of the MiG-35 is also in the vast experience in Russian-Indian military cooperation. The expert gave a reminder that \"in the post-Soviet period production of the MiG family of aircraft under license was successfully launched. In addition, a contract was concluded for the delivery of MiG-29K ship-based fighter aircraft.\" However, according to Mr Makiyenko, in the end it cannot be excluded that India is reconsidering the conditions of the tender as a whole: \"It would be logical to reformulate the tender for the fifth-generation aircraft,\" due to the fact that the country's Air Force is counting on utilizing these fighter aircraft for no less than 50 years.

Salma Malik conducted the proceedings. The second day proceedings mainly consisted of interactive sessions in three groups on Russia and US, led by former ambassadors Tanvir Ahmad Khan and Ali Sarwar Naqvi respectively, whereas group on China was led by Akram Zaki and Prof Zhou Rong. Muhammad Ali in his presentation on Russia said that Rus sia remained confined to one key regional actor, mainly India, and its biggest yet singular selling commodity has been military hardware. Owing to this unifocal approach, Russia since decades failed to claim a space for itself in the region. The implications, and interactive opportunities for Pakistan vis-a-vis Moscow can be a better cooperation over energy as a viable selling commodity, he said adding that it although would not replace US as the most important player in the region, at least Russia can have a viable niche in countries other than India. Shah Fad representing US group said that said that US has de-hyphenated India and Pakistan to deal with these countries at its own terms, where nuclear energy cooperation with India is necessary for strengthening New Delhi as a future regional proxy, Pakistani nuclear ambitions must be harnessed. There is a need to maintain a rough parity between India and Pakistan and better economic and energy sector engagements with India will set the course for future. China in comparison to Russia will set the future regional dynamics and the US must be wary of that and prepare India accordingly, he said. Salma Shaheen representing group on China said that Chinas interest is to counter Indian influence in the region and wants to deeper relations with Pakistan to balance out India. She said Beijing further wants to maintain healthy relations with regional states and avoid confrontation and aims at peace and stability. As an important regional power, China also wants to keep a check on NATO plan in the region and the efforts of US and other powers. China is also concerned about the terrorism and separatists movements in the region which is closer to its Muslim-majority Xinjiang province. She said Beijing has serious concerns about climate changes and with regard to nuclear issues; it is preparing second strike capability. The key challenges faced by the country are; poverty, communication barrier (language), growing positive Indian image in the world community and perceived upcoming threats. She said China wanted refraining India and Pakistan from edging towards any nuclear crisis and also interested in a stable and strong Pakistan.

Sudershan Reddy and S.S. Nijjar asked counsel for the State to respond, he said Salwa Judum did not exist. Justice Reddy told him: \"Your assertion is contrary to reports of various independent expert groups on the presence of Salwa Judum. You tell us why the State can't disband Salwa Judum.\"Earlier senior counsel Ashok Desai, appearing for petitioners Nandini Sundar and others, maintained that Salwa Judu m was constituted to terrorise people. He explained how the National Human Rights Commission highlighted the atrocities of Salwa Judum and asked the State to register cases. Though First Information Reports were registered, he said, prosecution did not take place since there was no further enquiry. Rehabilitation plan Mr. Desai said though the State was asked to come out with a rehabilitation plan, it drew up one that only covered Salwa Judum supporters, ignoring the victims of vigilante groups and state violence. The State was also asked to ensure that police forces vacated schools, hospitals, ashrams and anganwadis which they had used as camps, but it did not comply with this order.He wanted an independent committee to monitor the implementation of the rehabilitation plan.Additional Solicitor-General Vivek Tanka, appearing for the Centre, informed the court that it was the State government that provided the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) with accommodation. The force would accept whatever accommodation given to it. The Bench listed the matter for Thursday for further hearing.

And if this sector was not to be opened to private players, the bill was not needed. This view was repeatedly articulated by Arun Jaitley and other senior party leaders.However, on Wednesday, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj conceded \"such legislation is indeed needed, but it must be India-specific.\" She also said the party would accept the gov ernment's assurance that there was no plan for opening up the nuclear sector to private operators.The government that had capped liability at the first level at Rs. 500 crore was now prepared to consider the Opposition demand for \"unlimited liability\" to be administered entirely through a claims commissioner, instead of splitting up the liability at two different levels.\"If the bill is re-drafted and shown to us, if it is India-specific, we can agree to it. We are not opposing the bill for the sake of opposing it; we do need such a law,\" Ms. Swaraj said. She added her party did not think there was any need for India to contribute to and become a member of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation. \"We can set up our own fund. We have suggested that.\"She said during the meeting after \"listening to us,\" Mr. Mukherjee said \"there could be some meeting ground.\"The government indicated it was ready to hold a similar dialogue wi th the Left parties, but they, it said, seem to have taken a \"political decision\" not to support the bill.The government rejected a suggestion by the Opposition it was in a hurry to get the bill through Parliament ahead of the visit of United States President Barack Obama. \"We have to get the bill through. That is our responsibility, as it is also to try and take other parties along. We need the bill and that is recognised by the Opposition too. What has that to do with Mr. Obama's visit?\"As he came out of the meeting with Mr. Mukherjee, Mr. Jaswant Singh said the BJP cannot be \"hustled.\" He conceded that a national law was necessary and nuclear civil liability arising should cover any accident -- not only new nuclear plants but also existing ones as well as those in the strategic sector.Mr. Bansal said the government was making an effort to get the BJP on board, but primarily the power and responsibility for drafting the bill rested with it.

The SP MLAs, incensed at some remarks made by Irrigation and PWD Minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui, stormed the well and later staged a dharna and ignored the Speaker Sukhdev Rajbhar's plea to return to their seats.Mr. Rajbhar repeatedly asked the Leader of the Opposition, Shivpal Singh Yadav, to tell his MLAs to take their seats.The Supplementary Grants of Rs.5,461 crore was passed by voice vote amidst the din even as the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress staged a walkout in protest against the funds sought for parks and memorials.The Muslim issue figured during Zero Hour with the SP drawing attention towards the plight of the minority community and their abject living conditions in the light of the Sachar Committee report. .While Imran Masood and Iqbal Mahmood demanded separate reservation for Muslims, Shadab Fatima said not a single Muslim was the district magistrate or DIG in the State. Ghazala Basheer wanted steps to be taken to protect the graveyards from encroachment and Arif Anwar Hashmi said the representation of Muslims in government jobs should increase.Matters came to a head when the Irrigation Minister said there were 31 Muslim MLAs in the BSP (as compared to 15 in the SP) and he could not be stopped from speaking.

The Jakarta Post reported that the central bank data showed foreign loans of the private sector in the first six months of this year jumped 92.4 percent to 15.7 billion U.S. dollars from 8. 2 billion U.S. dollars in the same period of last year. Most of firms listed at the Jakarta Stock Exchange show a good performance in the first half by registering high profits.Indonesia' economy grew 5.9 percent in the first half, higher than 4.2 percent in the same period last year. \"The relatively high jump compared to last year is due to a contraction in the first half of 2009 regarding the subprime mortgage crisis,\" central bank spokesman Difi A. Johansyah said.Indonesia registered the highest growth in the world after China and India during the first half of 2009.Indonesian Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo has said that the economy is seen to accelerate at 5.9 percent this year but, the National Statistic Agency has said that it may exceed the target as the exports and investment in the country's with over 230 million population predicted to rebound this year.The spokesman said that the number o f loan in the first half reflected growing interest from foreign investors in Indonesia's private sector.Strong fundamentals with modest growth and expectation to investment grade rated by most of rating agencies, have made Indonesia the best investment destination in the region.(Description of Source: Beijing Xinhua in English -- China's official news service for English-language audiences (New China News Agency)) Material in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the source cited.

The game was up for the second year BSc student from a reputed city college on Wednesday, when he was nabbed by the anti-terrorism squad (ATS).Hours after he was picked up, investigators found out that Kashyap was \"experimenting with his passion and knowledge\". The media houses received the mail on August 7 and the sender identified himself as Imran Azhar Khan. A resident of Central Railway colony in Kurla and son of a motorman, Kashyap had been hacking and misusing internet accounts as his family could not afford to have a connection at home.\"During a preliminary interrogation, he told us he sent the mail as a prank. We are probing the matter further since it i s a sensitive case,\" said Nasir Kulkarni, assistant police inspector, ATS.He has been booked under various sections of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code and remanded in police custody till August16. Senior ATS officials said since Kashyap hacked into other's net accounts, it was difficult to trace him and they were on a wild goose chase until they traced him.The cyber team of the ATS got cracking after the media houses received the messages and traced the sender's address: yuvrajpatil00@gmail.com. The investigators first picked up a youth from Ghatkopar for preliminary enquiry. However, he was let off. A few days later, the ATS picked up a businessman from Ghatkopar, who was a cloth merchant and shuttled between Surat and Mumbai.\"While questioning him, we found out that his computer had been out of order for the last six months,\" said a senior ATS official. A team of cyber experts were called in to scrutinising his system and that's when they figured that someone else was tampering with it. \"Eventually, we traced the mischief to Kashyap,\" added the official.

The oil slick has also reached the high tide mark in these areas. Experts say that the leak has set an ecological disaster in motion, which will see many casualties. The only thing is the casualties will not include human beings now. But as the lower strata of the food chain gets affected, even that possibility cannot be denied. According to experts, contamination transfers to higher levels of food chain soon after it reaches the lowest strata. There have already been reports of dead sea-snakes, smeared with oil, being spotted on the Uran beach and the mangroves turning black in Vashi in Mumbai. Worst affected Sasawne in Konkan is one of the worst-affected areas. The stench of the oil can be smelled from as far as 150 metres\"I spotted the tentacles of so many small filter feeders (animal-like sponges which filter food particles from the sea) and other small sea animals full of oil here,\" Mr. Apte said during the field visit to the affected areas. He showed sea algae swathed in oil. \"They will all die,\" ; he said. Though the Mandwa beach looks comparatively cleaner from a distance, if one stands on the shore, the sand around the feet, which erodes after the wave, leaves a glistening rim bordering the footmarks. Just a bit of digging in the sand reveals a thin layer of oil that has already percolated in the sand and has formed a thin film beneath. This film asphyxiates all the life forms beneath it. Walking on this beach tars one's feet. Dipping the hands in the sea at Sasawne greases the palms. Worrisome This is worrisome as it is a much richer area in terms of marine biodiversity and has lots of sensitive species. This region also breeds marine organisms such as lobsters and oysters. They survive on dead and decaying material in the sea and the filter feeders. The disturbance in this breeding ground is set to have an adverse impact on the livelihood of the people there, as that is their primary source of survival. Affects tourism The oil contami nation in the sea is also set to affect the tourism in this region, which is an all-time favourite weekend destination for many from Mumbai, Pune and nearby cities. \"People come here with their families to set out in the open and beautiful sea. With this leak, the entire area is contaminated now. Who would want to come here to smell the oil?\" asked Ravi Apte, who owns a home stay facility close to the sea shore in Sasawne. The area is also known for turtle nesting. December to February is the nesting season here. \"As the oil has percolated in the substrata of the sand, it is very difficult for the eggs to hatch. Even if you come here after three years, you will still find the oil here,\" Mr. Deepak Apte said. The villagers are primarily concerned about their livelihood now. \"The government has issued a warning against going in the sea. But this is festive season for us with raksha bandhan and other festivals. We cannot celebrate in this condition,\" said Ramchandra Nakwa, a fisherman from Revas. The slipped containers of the ship have goods strewn across the beach. People have been carrying bagful of tea powder, biscuits and other goodies for the past three days. Experts do not discount the possibility of their contamination, but the villagers ignore the warnings.

Chidambaram said on Wednesday that the Centre would not encourage anyone to support the Maoists. \"No one should support the CPI (Maoist) and the government certainly will not encourage anyone to s upport the CPI (Maoist),\" he said during question hour in the Rajya Sabha.Mr. Chidambaram was replying to questions raised by Ramdas Agarwal (BJP). who alleged that anti-national activities were being carried out in Naxal-affected areas.Without naming Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee, who recently organised a controversial rally in Lalgarh, Mr. Agarwal wanted to know whether the government would take action against \"influential\" people who were openly supporting the Maoists.Prasanta Chatterjee (CPI-M) demanded a CBI inquiry into the Lalgarh issue.The Left, the BJP and a few other parties have been disrupting Parliament proceedings for the past two days over the alleged involvement of the Maoists in organising Trinamool Congress rally at Lalgarh in West Bengal. They have been demanding a probe.To a question, Mr. Chidambaram said there was no evidence that the CPI (Maoist) was getting overt support from any international terrorist organisation or international m ilitant organisation.\"There was one report about a contact between an organisation in Nepal and the CPI (Maoist), but that has not been confirmed either. There is no evidence that they receive money or weapons from China -- China as a country or China as an entity. Weapons are indeed smuggled from across the border -- both the Bangladesh border and the Myanmar border.\"Mr. Chidambaram also pointed out that the CPI (Maoist) was able to raise funds within the country. \"They are able to raise money through extortion, through levies, and through looting. But we are keeping a careful watch. If there is any evidence that they receive money or receive other support from any organisation abroad, certainly, we shall look into the matter very carefully and, with the help of friendly countries, take action against those organisations which are reported to be supporting the CPI (Maoist).\" (Description of Source: Chennai The Hindu Online in English -- Website of the most influential English daily of southern India.

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with ‚Äúunspecified casualties‚Äù on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi‚Äôs China and Modi‚Äôs India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China‚Äôs ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China‚Äôs abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India‚Äôs protest in denying Beijing‚Äôs claims as ‚Äúexaggerated and untenable‚Äù is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world‚Äôs fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs ‚Äúclarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat‚Äù_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India‚Äôs active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China‚Äôs nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India‚Äôs nuclear strike range_** **_(right) ‚Äì estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India‚Äôs national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China‚Äôs ‚Äúcontainment of India,‚Äù the modernization of the PLA and its ‚Äúgrowing assertiveness on the border‚Äù, and recommended a shift of India‚Äôs national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China‚Äôs unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or ‚Äústring of pearls‚Äù that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India‚Äôs security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China‚Äôs development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India‚Äôs peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China‚Äôs energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China‚Äôs power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China‚Äôs ‚ÄúMalacca dilemma,‚Äù by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing‚Äôs interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of ‚Äúthe quad‚Äù, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing‚Äôs ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India‚Äôs nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India‚Äôs boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India‚Äôs dismay. When BRI‚Äôs flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India‚Äôs doctrine of ‚Äústrategic autonomy‚Äù. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek ‚Äúequivalence‚Äù with the great powers ‚Äî China, Russia, US ‚Äî in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi‚Äôs party and support the base‚Äôs nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem ‚Äútechno-nationalism‚Äù.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India‚Äôs dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India‚Äôs military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China‚Äôs expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India‚Äôs $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China‚Äôs relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China‚Äôs expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India‚Äôs $71 billion. Commensurate to China‚Äôs 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a ‚Äúpeaceful rise‚Äù of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world‚Äôs longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India‚Äôs options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India‚Äôs strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India‚Äôs preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India‚Äôs ‚ÄúNeighborhood First‚Äù policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi‚Äôs ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka‚Äôs Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal‚Äôs stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the ‚ÄúChina-Maldives Friendship Bridge‚Äù as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the ‚ÄúAsian Century‚Äù may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India‚Äôs geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide ‚Äúchicken‚Äôs neck‚Äù connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China‚Äôs favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi‚Äôs strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India‚Äôs advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ‚Äùpartners‚Äù with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh‚Äôs deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter‚Äôs Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China‚Äôs border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its ‚Äúlike-minded partners‚Äù in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India‚Äôs diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war ‚Äì for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India‚Äôs irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China‚Äôs assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-√†-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, ‚Äúwolf-warrior diplomacy‚Äù, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India ‚Äì the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its ‚ÄúNORMS ‚Äî New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System‚Äù approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India‚Äôs quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact ‚Äì an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China ‚Äì to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia ‚Äì India‚Äôs soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter‚Äôs unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese ‚Äúiron brother‚Äù, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China‚Äôs increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India‚Äôs disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, ‚Äúa victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.‚Äù\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China‚Äôs thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell ‚Äî one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOorD5qivlKr2EDLlPurrKrB1Tr759R_oZtMzJq_UPkH-xwZw139I#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People‚Äôs Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

It continues to be so.‚Äù_‚Äì Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India‚Äôs existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory ‚Äì 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‚Äòliberated zone‚Äô the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India‚Äôs economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world‚Äôs reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country‚Äôs gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _‚ÄúWe are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.‚Äù_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same ‚Äì rendering the Indian state incapable of governing ‚Äì but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency‚Äôs deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets ‚Äì that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: ‚Ä¢ **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi ‚Ä¢ **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii ‚Ä¢ **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company‚Äôs coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‚ÄòJnaneswari Express‚Äô, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road ‚Äì incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million ‚Äì a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC‚Äôs plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren‚Äôt they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _‚ÄúThe Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won‚Äôt ruin its work.‚Äù_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari‚Äôs revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India‚Äôs illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy ‚Äì somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a ‚Äúrevolutionary tax.‚Äù One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state‚Äôs Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year‚Äôs estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh‚Äôs criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: ‚Ä¢ **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. ‚Ä¢ **Narcotics.** India is the world‚Äôs largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India‚Äôs opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. ‚Ä¢ **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.‚Äù_‚ÄìArvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India‚Äôs most removed citizens. India‚Äôs strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, ‚ÄúNaxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,‚Äù Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India‚Äôs New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, ‚ÄúPillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,‚Äù Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, ‚ÄúFact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),‚Äù Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, ‚ÄúThe Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,‚Äù 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi ‚ÄúChhattisgarh‚Äôs Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,‚Äù Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, ‚ÄúFormer Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,‚Äù Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, ‚ÄúMaoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,‚Äù Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, ‚ÄúIllegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,‚Äù Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, ‚ÄúLoss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,‚Äù Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi ‚ÄúChronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,‚Äù India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, ‚ÄúMaoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,‚Äù Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii ‚ÄúNaxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,‚Äù Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, ‚ÄúNaxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,‚Äù India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, ‚ÄúNaxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,‚Äù Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi ‚ÄúNMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,‚Äù The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii ‚ÄúNaxals Obstruct Road Works,‚Äù The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, ‚Äú550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,‚Äù The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx ‚ÄúWorld Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India‚Äôs Rural Roads Scheme,‚Äù Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, ‚ÄúMaoists‚Äô Financing ‚Äì The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,‚Äù Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, ‚ÄúMaoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,‚Äù The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, ‚ÄúRs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,‚Äù The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, ‚ÄúRed Money,‚Äù Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,‚Äù The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, ‚ÄúOur Own Banana Republics!‚Äù Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ‚ÄúIndia is a Major Drug Hub: US,‚Äù September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

assistance in setting it up using our simple webchat available at: [https://wikileaks.org/talk](https://wikileaks.org/talk) If you can use Tor, but need to contact WikiLeaks for other reasons use our secured webchat available at **http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion** We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can.

In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. #### Tails If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called [Tails](https://tails.boum.org). Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.

Please review these basic guidelines. #### 1\\. Contact us if you have specific problems If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please [contact us](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/52/5286513_stratfor-india-country-brief-nov-2-2011-.html#submit_help_contact). In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations. #### 2\\. What computer to use If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer. #### 3\\. Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection ‚Äì it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection ‚Äì it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. #### 2\\. Act normal If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. #### 3\\. Remove traces of your submission If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion. #### 4\\. If you face legal action If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at [https://www.couragefound.org](https://www.couragefound.org). # Submit documents to WikiLeaks WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed.

Full Text Basic Political Developments Congress not worried by Anna's threats of fast, says Digvijaya Press Trust of India, Updated: November 02, 2011 17:22 IST http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/congress-not-worried-by-anna-s-threats-of-fast-says-digvijaya-146234 Rampur (Uttar Pradesh): A day after Anna Hazare threatened to launch another hunger strike if a strong Jan Lokpal Bill was not passed in the Parliament's Winter Session, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh today said his party is not afraid of the Gandhian's threats. \"Congress is neither bothered, nor afraid of Anna's threat to resume his fast on the last day of Parliament's Winter Session if the government fails to get a strong Jan Lokpal Bill passed by then,\" he said at a religious function in Sambhal town of Moradabad district, around 70 km from here. Digvijaya said Team Anna's claim that they have the support of over one crore people on the Jan Lokpal Bill issue is \"unfounded, hollow and fictitious\". Replying to a query on 'gupt daan' (secret donations) to the NGO, India Against Corruption, run by Arvind Kejriwal during Anna's hunger strike in Delhi, Singh said sarcastically, \"Na khata na bahi, jo Kejriwal kahe wahi sahi (There is no account book. Whatever Kejriwal says, is correct and unquestionable).\" CBI summons Jagan for questioning in alleged mining scam http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/andhra-pradesh/article2591464.ece CBI has called Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, son of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, for questioning on November 4 in connection with alleged multi-crore iron ore mining scam. The agency is probing an alleged nexus between Mr. Jagan and Janardhana Reddy whose company Obulapuram Mining Company (OMC) has been accused of violating mining norms in the Ananthpuram district of Andhra Pradesh, CBI sources said. The clearance for mining leases to OMC was given during the tenure of Rajasekhara Reddy as Chief Minister. CBI has recently questioned the then cabinet colleagues of the late Rajasekhara Reddy in connection with the mining scam as it found that mining leases for OMC were cleared in an unusual haste, they said. Kadapa MP Jagan is also facing allegations of amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income as well as alleged dilution of stake of Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructural Corporation (APIIC) which is having a joint venture with Emaar for the development of township on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The sources said CBI has called Mr. Jagan for questioning in connection with these allegations on November 4 at the Hyderabad office of the agency. Chidambaram appeals for peace in Manipur PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591394.ece Chidambaram appeals to Manipur groups to withdraw blockade Manipur: SHDC withdraws blockade Nagas call for three-day total blockade NIA will not oppose bail of Malegaon accused: Chidambaram 48-hour bandh in hill districts of Manipur from Monday Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, who arrived in Imphal on Wednesday on a two-day visit to Manipur, toured Naga-dominated interior Senapati hill district and appealed to people to settle all issues through dialogue. Inaugurating a mini-secretariat building at Senapati district headquarters, Mr. Chidambaram said all efforts would be made to bring peace, harmony and development in the state. On October 31, Sadar Hills District Demand Committee SHDDC, which had launched economic blockades on Imphal-Dimapur -- Guwahati (NH-39) and Imphal-Jiribam-Silchar (NH-53), called off the 92-day strike after the state government assured them that their demands would be looked into. The SHDDC was demanding conversion of Kuki-dominated Sadar Hills area into Naga-majority Senapati district, Official said Mr. Chidambaram preferred to visit the interior hill district because both Nagas and Kukis there were well disposed towards the demand of the SHDDC for conversion of the Sadar Hills area into a full-fledged revenue district. Mr. Chidambaram would visit various parts of the interior hill district during his two-day visit. The minister after spending about one hour in the district visited another Naga-dominated district Ukhrul, bordering Myanmar, where he inaugurated a SDO office. Officials said he would hold a meeting with Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh to take stock of the law and order situation in Manipur. Meanwhile, the United Naga Council said it will continue its economic blockade on the two national highways on Manipur side and called a three-day bandh from midnight on Thursday to protest against the government's assurance of turning Sadar Hills area in Senapati district into a separate district. An UNC spokesman said the bandh will be supported by All Naga Students Association Manipur. He said the ongoing economic blockade on the Manipur parts of the NH 39 and NH 53 which the group had launched on August 21 would continue. He said the bandh would cover all Naga-settled areas in Manipur. Reveal names of black money account holders: Advani to govt. PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591671.ece BJP leader L.K. Advani today asked the government to make public names of those who have stashed black money abroad and sought their immediate prosecution. \"Without any further delay prosecution must be initiated and appropriate follow up action taken,\" Mr. Advani said referring to the people whose names have been provided to India by various foreign governments in this regard. \"Already there is a talk about three MPs having been identified, and the Government of France has given India a list of names of those possessing illegal wealth in Swiss and other foreign banks. The country eagerly expects their names to be made public. The UPA government will try to evade the issue once again, as has been its dismal record,\" he told reporters here. Mr. Advani said the Directorate of criminal investigation of Income Tax department had sent notices to persons involved in black money cases following scrutiny of classified banking data received from foreign countries about Swiss bank accounts. \"This is an issue on which there should be no hush hush...All information with the government on money stashed away abroad should be shared,\" he demanded. The BJP leader said, \"I have repeatedly asked for a White Paper on the issue of black money giving facts, giving names and above all giving details of all the steps taken by the government to get back this money which legitimately belongs to India. I believe that it cannot be allowed to be kept in foreign banks.\" Mr. Advani said that the American think tank \\`Global Financial Integrity' had estimated the amount of Indian black money in foreign banks at around Rs. 25 lakh crores. \"It is a staggering amount,\" he said, adding that this money should be used for the development of rural India. Government unveils bill for time-bound public services http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/government-unveils-bill-for-time-bound-public-services/articleshow/10582090.cms NEW DELHI: The government Wednesday unveiled a bill that seeks to get committed standards of public service and redressal of grievances in a stipulated time frame. The Citizens Right to Grievance Redress Bill, 2011 will look at complaints of violation of the citizens' charter to be formulated by each government department, identify liabilities of public servants in case of default and impose penalities for failure to deliver services or redress grievances in a time-bound manner. Speaking about the bill, the Minister of State for Personnel V. Narayanasamy said its architechture will ensure an appropriate decentralised and citizen-friendly mechanism to redress public grievances. \"The citizen's charter will have to be defined by the authorities at various levels, including panchayats, municipalities, states and the centre. For every authority, there will be a Grievance Redress Officer,\" Narayanasamy told mediapersons at a joint briefing with Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh. He said the bill will be put up on the website of the department of personnel for 21 days for people to give their comments. \"We will like to introduce it (the bill) in the winter session (of parliament Nov 22-Dec 21) after cabinet approval,\" he said. Narayanasamy said the bill can be enacted as a central legislation under the concurrent list and cover central schemes and central government departments. It will provide a platform to states to make a grievance redressal mechanism for state schemes and departments. Ramesh said the bill was another landmark in the \"rights-based approach followed\" by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. \"It (the) bill gives people legal entitlement,\" he said. Parallel trial cannot take place outside courts: Salman Khurshid Published: Wednesday, Nov 2, 2011, 17:32 IST http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report\\_parallel-trial-cannot-take-place-outside-courts-salman-khurshid\\_1606519 Taking exception to BJP leader LK Advani seeking answers on the PMO's role in the 2G issue, Law Minister Salman Khurshid today said as the case was already before the courts, a \"parallel trial\" cannot take place outside. \"A parallel trial cannot go on outside the courts... There is a basic thing that I want Mr Advani to know, that there is a principle of sub judice that you cannot discuss what's happening in the court,\" he told reporters here. He said if things which are before the court are discussed outside, \"there is a danger that you will influence what the courts will do.\" Khurshid was reacting to Advani's comment that if the PMO felt that then Finance Minister P Chidambaram had not taken timely measures to prevent 2G scam, the Prime Minister should have permitted a probe against him. \"It was incumbent upon the Prime Minister to permit investigation into his(Chidambaram's) role instead of expressing confidence in him saying he is innocent.\" National Economic Trends India ranked 134th in terms of Human Development Index Press Trust of India, Updated: November 02, 2011 18:45 IST http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/india-ranked-134th-in-terms-of-human-development-index-146261 New Delhi: A United Nations study has ranked India at 134 out of 187 countries in terms of Human Development Index even as it has observed that life expectancy at birth in the country has increased by 10.1 per cent a year over the last two decades. In the 2010 Human Development Report, prepared by UNDP, India had been ranked at 119 out of 169 countries. But the new report for 2011 says it is misleading to compare values and rankings with those of previously published reports, because the underlying data and methods have changed, as well as the number of countries included in the Human Development Index. The report said India's Human Development Index (HDI) value for 2011 was 0.547 positioning the country in the 'medium human development category'. Neighbouring Pakistan was ranked at 145 (0.504) and Bangladesh at 146 (0.500) respectively in terms of HDI. It said between 1980 and 2011, India's HDI value increased from 0.344 to 0.547, an increase of 59 per cent or an average annual increase of about 1.5 per cent. However, the report pointed that the country's HDI of 0.547 was below the average of 0.630 for countries in the medium human development group and below the average of 0.548 for countries in South Asia. The HDI is a measure for assessing long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development such as a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The report said the \"mean\" year of schooling for the country increased by 3.9 years between 1980 and 2011 and expected years of schooling increased by 3.9 years. Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, who was present at the report release function, however, sounded dismissive about the figures in the report. He said a better way of analysing the progress made by countries including India is to measure comparative success they have achieved on this count in the last few years from their previous record rather than by the number of their positions in the international chart. Ramesh said such presentation of human development indices is \"grossly misleading\" and the country's progress in this respect should be seen from a 20-year perspective. He said India has made huge strides in the field of education and water supply system but admitted that the biggest block in the human development indices for India is in the field of sanitation where 58 per cent of open defecation in the world takes place in India. He also rued that a mere expenditure of Rs. 2000 crore in the field of sanitation is being made while the budget for water supply was Rs. 20,000 crore. Ramesh said that the answer to the problem of sanitation is massive public investment in the sector on the lines of what the Central Government has done in education sector.

Gujarat NRE's Australian subsidiary owns and operates two hard coking coal mines in New South Wales (NSW) province of Australia. The company produces 1.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of coking coal and has plans to increase the quantum to 6 MTPA by 2015. Last month, Gujarat NRE Coking Coal Ltd, the Australian subsidiary of the Kolkata-based company, secured approval from the NSW Planning Assessment Commission for a USD 122 million upgrade of its infrastructure at the NRE-1 mine in Russel Vale, Australia. The approval will enable the company to continue to mine up to 1 MTPA of coking coal from the mine over the next three years. Company Executive Chairman Arun Kumar Jagatramka said, \"The grant of the (long-term loan) facility agreement on the back of the approval granted by the NSW Planning Assessment Commission represents another significant milestone for the company.\" Gujarat NRE Coke ( GNCL) had announced last month that by the end of the year, it will make public the USD 250 million new investment plan for the Russell Vale mine, which is estimated to hold 337 million tonnes of coking coal reserves. The proposal is part of GNCL's USD 486 million investment plan for its Australian assets, where it aims to increase total production to 6 MTPA by 2015. Shares of the company were being traded at Rs 24.75 apiece on the BSE at 1415 hours, up 1.02 per cent from their previous close.

The third quarter ushered in new orders worth Rs 729 crore for the construction of a commercial building, university, residential towers and an automobile factory from various clients, it said. \"These orders further enhance the order book of the company which has already secured major design and build contracts for airports, IT Parks, commercial and residential projects in India and abroad,\" the firm said.

Coal India Ltd gets Finance Ministry's nod for acquiring unlisted foreign companies http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/power/coal-india-ltd-gets-finance-ministrys-nod-for-acquiring-unlisted-foreign-companies/articleshow/10580433.cms KOLKATA: Mining company Coal India Ltd (CIL) has got the Finance Ministry's nod for acquiring stake in overseas unlisted firms. \"We have received Union Finance Ministry's clarifications sought for overseas acquisitions. The ministry permitted (us) to go ahead with acquisition of unlisted firms,\" CIL chairman N C Jha said on the sidelines of the company's Foundation Day celebrations attended by Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal. However, the Finance Ministry has not given complete relaxation to the norm of minimum 12 per cent internal rate of return (IRR) from such acquisitions. \"The Finance Ministry has said we can go ahead with the proposals even if the return is below 12 per cent if they are for strategic reasons, but those has to be cleared by them,\" Jha said. He said CIL received proposals offering IRR between 9 and 12 per cent. The Finance Ministry will scrutinise the deals offering below 12 per cent IRR. CIL, the world's largest coal miner, failed to strike any deal due to procedural delays in approval by the government. It had sought relaxation in two parameters of overseas acquisition norms, which were allowing them to acquire stake in unlisted firms, including those offering below 12 per cent IRR. Jha said they would now pursue with some of the proposals lying before them. SAIL, Posco likely to have equal stake in joint venture Last updated on: November 02, 2011 17:20 IST http://www.rediff.com/business/report/sail-posco-likely-to-have-equal-stake-in-jv/20111102.htm An equal joint venture agreement between state-run SAIL \\[ Get Quote \\] and South Korean major Posco is likely to be inked during Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma's proposed visit to Korea starting November 5. The shareholding pattern of the proposed venture is seen as a hurdle in signing the pact. The proposed joint venture aims to set up a plant at an investment of Rs 16,000 crore (Rs 160 billion) in Bokaro to produce three million tonne auto-grade steel. \"We may have 51 per cent equity or it could be 50:50,\" Verma told reporters when asked about the likely shareholding pattern in the JV. A senior official in the ministry, however, said the two parties have nearly reached an understanding to make it an equal joint venture. Posco's patented Finex technology, which would be used in the proposed new plant, is not being used any company other than Posco. Finex is an environment-friendly iron-making process where iron ore fines are directly used. There is also the iron ore price issue which is yet to be resolved, Verma said, adding that if all the pending issues were not cleared within next two days, he might even cancel his tour. The official, however, ruled out cancellation of Minister's visit to Korea. Verma is slated to leave Korea for Russia \\[ Images \\] on November 9 and come back to India on November 12. In Russia, he will attend the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signing ceremony between state-run iron ore miner NMDC and Russia's Severstal.

Activity in the Oil and Gas sector (including regulatory) Have sought EGoM meet on diesel, LPG rate hike: Oil Minister http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/have-sought-egom-meet-on-diesel-lpg-rate-hike-oil-minister/articleshow/10580545.cms NEW DELHI With oil companies losing Rs 333 crore per day on selling fuel below cost, Petroleum Minister S Jaipal Reddy has sought a meeting of a high-powered ministerial panel to decide on revising the rates of diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene. \"I have asked for a meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM),\" Reddy told reporters after a meeting with Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the EGoM. State-owned oil firms are currently losing Rs 9.27 per litre of diesel, Rs 26.94 per litre of kerosene sold through the public distribution system ( PDS) and Rs 260.50 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder supplied to households for cooking purposes. The EGoM \"meeting would take place before the Winter Session of Parliament\", beginning November 22, he said, adding that a decision on raising prices may \"not be easy\". The ministerial panel is essentially a consensus-building body of the Congress-led UPA government and comprises key allies like the DMK, TMC and NC. The allies had in September scuttled plans to limit the supply of subsidised LPG cylinders to 4-6 per household in a year so that subsidies can be cut. Reddy said his ministry would push for raising prices of all three regulated products, diesel, LPG and kerosene. On oil companies pressing for a hike in petrol prices, he said PSUs were fully empowered to take a view, keeping in mind rising crude oil prices and depreciating rupee. \"Our ministry does not administer\" the price of petrol, which was freed from government control in June last year, he said. Yesterday, HPCL Director (Finance) B Mukherjee had said that oil firms may have to raise petrol prices, as they were losing Rs 1.50 per litre at the current rates. Hindustan Petroleum sells gasoline in rare tender http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/hindustan-petroleum-sells-gasoline-in-rare-tender/articleshow/10580752.cms SINGAPORE: India's Hindustan Petroleum Corp has sold a rare gasoline cargo through a tender, industry sources said on Wednesday. The refiner sold 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes of 90 RON gasoline for Nov 25-27 loading to Vitol at a discount of $1.75 per barrel to Singapore quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, they said. It is unusual for the Indian state-owned refiner to export gasoline as it is usually a net importer of the product, sources in India said. The cargo was said to be not compatible with the domestic Indian specifications as its sulphur content was too high, they said. \"It's only a one time cargo, public sector units or state refiners don't ever sell gasoline unless it's off-specs, which cannot be sold in the domestic market, so this cargo didn't match the Euro III standards,\" said one of the sources. The sale of the cargo was due to a domestic surplus of the product, a second source said. Vitol is likely to use the cargo for blending purposes, they said. But this could not be verified. GAIL (India) earmarks $400 mn for Singapore LNG trading business in 2012 http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/gail-india-earmarks-400-mn-for-singapore-lng-trading-business-in-2012/articleshow/10580127.cms SINGAPORE: Gail (India) Ltd has earmarked USD 400 million for its new Singapore trading office to secure LNG and petrochemical product cargoes for delivery to India in 2012, Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi announced in Singapore today. Gail's Singapore office, which was inaugurated today but will begin trading next month on getting all formal approvals, will tie-up as much as USD 400 million worth of LNG cargoes and petrochemical products next year for delivery into India, he said after addressing a press conference. Ninety per cent of the trade would be in LNG from the initial start-up. \"India is a huge market for LNG and petrochemical products, while supply remains tight,\" stressed Tripathi, reaffirming Gail's commitment to energy development both within India and globally through an annual investment of USD 2 billion. He also disclosed that Gail was building shale gas expertise through participation in projects in the United States. \"The company is building expertise in shale gas and will participate in the Indian shale gas projects once the government announces its policy and development plans,\" he said. He said participation in US shale gas was a part of Gail's strategy to develop technology, expertise and know-how. Gail, along with its international partners in existing projects, will aggressively bid for shale gas concessions in India once the government puts them up for auction, which is expected to take place in about one year. Oil companies can decide on petrol price hike: Petroleum Ministry PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591304.ece A day after State-owned oil companies pressed for a petrol price hike, the Petroleum Ministry today said it is up to the oil firms to decide on raising the rates of the deregulated commodity. \"It is for them (oil companies) to decide. They will take a decision at a right time,\" Oil Secretary G.C. Chaturvedi told reporters here. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) Director (Finance) B.

Mr. Chaturvedi said petrol is a deregulated commodity whose pricing is not decided by the government. \"The oil companies are empowered to take a view on it,\" he said. Indian Oil, HPCL and Bharat Petroleum had last hiked petrol prices by Rs. 3.14 a litre on September 16, when the Indian rupee was valued at about Rs. 48 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate is now over Rs. 49 per U.S. dollar. \"From today, there are some losses on petrol. To cover them, we may have to increase prices,\" Mr. Mukherjee had said on Tuesday. He had stated that crude oil is hovering at around $108 per barrel in international markets. At the current exchange rate, the petrol price of Rs. 66.84 per litre in Delhi is equivalent to a crude oil price of about $102 per barrel. The government had in June last year deregulated, or freed, petrol from all price controls, but the retail rates have not moved in line with the cost as high inflation forced the oil companies to seek \"advice\" from the parent Oil Ministry before revising rates. Mr. Mukherjee did not say when petrol prices would be hiked. \"We are in consultations,\" he said, without elaborating. The loss on petrol is currently Rs. 1.50 per litre and after including local levies, the desired increase in retail prices is Rs. 1.82 per litre. \"Let's say, we are toying with the idea,\" he said. \"It may happen. We will see,\" he added. Besides petrol, the three firms are losing Rs. 333 crore per day on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene below cost. They lose Rs. 9.27 per litre on diesel, Rs. 26.94 per litre on kerosene sold through the public distribution system (PDS) and Rs. 260.50 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder supplied to domestic households for cooking purposes. At the current rate, the industry is projected to lose Rs. 121,459 crore in revenue on the sale of diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene in the full fiscal. While the loss on these three products is compensated through a combination of government cash subsidy and upstream oil firm dole-outs, there exists no such mechanism for making good the losses on petrol, as the product is deregulated Militant Activity/Terrorism (Particularly in Bangalore, Mumbai, Noida, Chennai, Coimbatore) All 15 kidnapped by Maoists in Bihar traceless PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2591362.ece The 15 people abducted by Maoists in Bihar's Jamui district on Monday are yet to be traced even as securitymen intensified operations to rescue them. \"There is still no trace of the kidnapped persons. The security personnel have intensified the operations to free them from the clutches of the Maoists,\" Jamui Superintendent of Police R N Singh said. Maoists kidnapped the 15 - eight labourers, four employees of a private construction company and three villagers - from Balthar Ghat. Late on Monday night, over 50 ultras stormed into the office of a private firm engaged by Bihar State Bridge Corporation for construction of a bridge over Bharnar River and took them away at gun point to a forest bordering Giridih district of Jharkhand. Ulfa hardliners warn of fresh attacks http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Ulfa-hardliners-warn-of-fresh-attacks/articleshow/10578603.cms GUWAHATI: After opposing the ongoing peace process and stating that the political conflict between India and Assam could only be resolved by holding discussions on \"sovereignty\", Ulfa hardliners on Tuesday issued a fresh warning of launching attacks on government transport, politicians, black marketers and corrupt officials. In an email sent by Arunodoy Dohotia, the chief of Ulfa's publicity wing, the hardliners asked the public to maintain safe distance from people belonging to any of the above mentioned categories. \"We want to alert everyone to keep away from government transport, vehicles of corrupt politicians and companies utilizing the resources of the state improperly, black marketeers and corrupt officials to avoid any kind of action,\" said Dohotia in the email. Meanwhile, the split between Ulfa hardliners and Arabinda Rajkhowa-led pro-talks faction has once again come to the fore with both sides involved in a mudslinging on the topic of \"sovereign Assam\". Another email sent by pro-talks Ulfa faction's publicity wing member Kamal Kachari rubbished the demand of \"sovereign\" Assam by saying that it has lost relevance in in today's time. \"The state is not asking for an armed movement. Paresh Baruah should not comment on the demand of Assam's sovereignty by staying at a distance. His demand has no relevance in today's time and is very immature,\" said Kachari. He added that the ongoing peace process will not be hampered by Paresh Baruh's personal statements. \"Though Baruah claims to represent the Assamese people, the commoners here don't want any more violence,\" he said in the email. On the other hand, pro-talks Ulfa leader Jiten Dutta was arrested for contempt of court on Tuesday. Dutta was held for not being present in the TADA court several times. He was taken to Guwahati Central Jail in the evening. Naxals gun-down villager on suspicion of being police informer http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/MP-RAI-naxals-gun-down-villager-on-suspicion-of-being-police-informer-2536070.html Raipur: A native of Aljam villge in Khadgaon, Rajanadgaon district, was shot dead by Naxalites on Monday night. The victim was dragged out of his house at night and tried in a Naxal \\`court' where he was found guilty of being a police informer. He was granted the death penalty and shot dead. Naxalites, who were reported to be around 40 in number, also asked all villagers to see the proceedings. More than 35 people have been shot dead in last 2-3 months by Naxalites for the same reason. Police say the act was to instill fear amongst villagers. Naxal activities have been on the rise in Rajanandgaon in recent times. In another brazen act seen recently, Naxalites entered an MLA's residence, snatched his gunner's weapon and escaped. Govt tightens railway security in Naxal areas http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/govt-tightens-railway-security-in-naxal-areas\\_739291.html New Delhi: The government on Tuesday decided to deploy additional forces to protect railway properties and tracks and install CCTV cameras at vulnerable stations located in Naxal-hit areas to check continuous attacks by extremists. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, convened by Union Home Secretary R K Singh and attended by Railway Board Chairman Vinay Mittal and police chiefs of West Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand. The meeting decided to augment the Railway Protection Force Personnel (RPF) in Maoist affected areas in coordination with State police forces to protect railway stations, tracks, godowns and intensify patrolling to ensure smooth running of trains, official sources said. Close Circuit Television Cameras will also be installed at vulnerable stations located in Naxal affected states to prevent extremist attacks. Dedicated officers will also be put in three designated places round the clock to coordinate security in railway properties, particularly on inter-state borders of West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Home Ministry officials are particularly concerned that Maoists have been attacking on goods trains loaded with coal and iron ore affecting industrial activities in different parts of the country as major coal and iron ores mines are located in these states. \"The meeting focused on systemic improvement of railway security,\" an official said. Currently, night running of trains has been suspended along two railway lines passing through the Naxal belt. There were 45 attacks on railway properties in 2010 and 23 this year till October 15. Labor/Social Unrest Pilots stir: Air India pilots move High Court http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/pilots-stir-air-india-pilots-move-high-court/articleshow/10575183.cms MUMBAI: A group representing a section of pilots of Air India has moved the Bombay High Court, challenging the management's decision to train pilots of the carrier's domestic operations in flying the latest Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. In its petition, the Indian Pilots' Guild (IPG) has alleged discrimination on part of the management at the national carrier in giving opportunities for career progression to the pilots of the erstwhile Indian Airlines. Despite the merger of the two state-owned carriers in 2007, issues of integration of pilots remain to be resolved at the cash-strapped airline. The matter, which will come up for hearing on November 2, will most likely be disposed the same day as training for batches of pilots is scheduled to commence the next day. On Tuesday, Air India's international operations suffered due to crew crunch as 23 IPG pilots reported sick. The pilots met the management, but the meeting did not resolve the crisis. The airline, in a statement, however said the pilots will not be going on strike and that operations will be normal. The IPG, which represents about 250 pilots from the airline's international operations, had written to Rohit Nandan, chairman and managing director on October 29, seeking a no-objection certificate for about 100 pilots so that they can find jobs elsewhere. \"We feel cheated by management's unfair and discriminatory decisions leading to a complete stall of our career progression,\" the letter said. Before the merger, Indian Airlines was to get 15 A330 wide body aircraft. \"But since it was decided that the two airlines will be merged, the deal to get the 15 A330s was done away with,\" said a senior commander who is currently flying A320s. \"We were made to understand that since Air India will get the Dreamliners (787s) there was enough scope for us to progress to wide body aircraft.\" The IPG and the pilots union of the erstwhile Indian Airlines, or the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), had agreed to send 16 sets of pilots each for training for the 787, at a meeting with the management two months ago. In December 2010, the then Air India chief Arvind Jadhav had allotted 40 slots of Boeing 787 to the Air India narrow body pilots, a move opposed by the IPG in a letter dated February 15, as an illegal and arbitrary order. The IPG alleges that the management's move to allow ICPA pilots to fly wide body aircraft is a violation of Air India Pilots' wage document and deed of recognition. Senior pilots in Air India say that pilots of ICPA who are flying narrow body aircraft are allowed to fly aircraft on Alliance Air (its domestic regional subsidiary) and they should do so as it flies narrow body aircraft fleet instead of eating into IPG's pie. The ICPA also claims that the commanders of Air India that are supposed to fly the 787 have much less number of flying hours. -- Anya Alfano Briefer STRATFOR T: 1.415.404.7344 \\| M: 221.77.816.4937 www.STRATFOR.com",

but based on military-level \"understandings\". - **LoC and IB - Distinct legal interpretations:** - **LoC (de facto border between India and Pakistan):** Approx. 740 km, from Sangam in Kashmir to Point NJ-9842 near the Siachen Glacier. - **IB:** - **In Jammu**, the LoC changes into the IB for India, since it has no territorial claims on Pakistani Punjab on the other side. - But for Pakistan, the IB is a ‚Äú **Working Boundary**‚Äù, since it claims Jammu on the Indian side - and hence deems the border unsettled. - **Operational dynamics:** - **Heavy troop presence** with fortified structures on both sides. - **Seasonal terrain shifts** affect actual positions. - **Mandate** is to prevent infiltration and unilateral changes. - However, there has been a **rise in infiltration** and Pakistan Border Action Teams (BAT) raids since **1989**. - **Ceasefire often violated** and restored informally - e.g., 2003, 2021. ## Nature of Ceasefire Violations - **Motivations behind violations:** - Typically **increase during every bilateral crisis** since 1972 to **impose military costs** on the other side. - Such violations have ranged from **limited small-arms fire** to full-fledged cross-border operations such as the **Indian surgical strikes** against terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan occupied Kashmir in 2016. - **\"Autonomous military factors\":** Local commanders act independently for boosting troop morale, revenge, testing enemy resolve. - **Absence of formal rules of engagement:** - **No strict protocols** prevent firing; governed by unwritten SOPs. - **Conflict resolution mechanisms:** - Flag meetings between local commanders. - Hotlines between DGMOs in New Delhi and Rawalpindi. - These reduce escalation but do not prevent future violations. ## Ceasefire Understanding of 2021 and Its Significance - **Strategic rationale behind 2021 understanding:** - **Pakistan:** Internal instability and Afghanistan border tensions. - **India:** Focus on China and the **Line of Actual Control** (LAC, Ladakh). - **Result:** Drop in violations, increased civilian safety, agriculture revival, and economic stability in border villages. - **Diplomatic and military communication:** - **Since the 2019** India-Pakistan diplomatic freeze, only military-level communication remains active. - **Weekly DGMO calls continue**; April 29 call saw India objecting to ongoing violations. ## Current Developments and Strategic Outlook - **Cross-border dynamics post-Pahalgam attack:** - Firing possibly used by Pakistan to maintain military pressure and leverage. - India needs to: - Retaliate (militarily) to the Pakistani violations. - Resolve BSF jawan detention issue (crossed IB accidentally on April 23). - During times of crisis, such accidental crossings act as leverage for one side over the other. - **Risks of escalation:** - Ceasefire violations are low-intensity yet high-risk events. - Often the first and most controlled military response in crisis. - However, **risk of rapid escalation remains**, especially **under public or political pressure.** ## Conclusion - **Ceasefire** at the LoC remains an evolving military understanding, **prone to crises and local dynamics.** - Despite communication mechanisms, **long-term peace requires political will and strategic foresight.** ## LoC & Strategic Dynamics in India-Pakistan Relations FAQs **Q1.** Explain the significance of the 2021 India-Pakistan DGMO understanding in the context of ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC). **Ans.** The 2021 DGMO understanding marked a significant de-escalation along the LoC, reducing ceasefire violations and allowing both countries to focus on internal and external strategic challenges, notably India‚Äôs LAC standoff with China. **Q2.** Differentiate between the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) in the context of India-Pakistan boundary disputes. **Ans.** The LoC is a military control line demarcated post-1972 Simla Agreement without legal international status, while the IB is a settled international boundary recognized by India but termed a \"Working Boundary\" by Pakistan. **Q3.** Discuss the role of ‚ÄòAutonomous Military Factors‚Äô in ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border. **Ans.** Autonomous Military Factors refer to localized military decisions, such as testing enemy positions or boosting troop morale, which often trigger ceasefire violations independent of political directives. **Q4.** What mechanisms exist to manage ceasefire violations between India and Pakistan, and how effective are they? **Ans.** Mechanisms like flag meetings and the DGMO hotline provide immediate conflict management tools, but they are not effective in preventing recurring violations. **Q5.** Assess the impact of ceasefire violations on civilian life in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir. **Ans.** Ceasefire violations disrupt civilian livelihoods through shelling-induced displacement, crop damage, and fatalities. **Source:** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-hot-loc-what-is-the-nature-of-india-pakistan-ceasefire-understanding-9979640/) * * * ‚Äã ‚Äã ‚Äã Submit * * * ![logo](https://vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) ¬© 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

While the establishment of the [**National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-disaster-management-authority-1) marked a positive step. The very nature of disasters has undergone a drastic shift. [**Extreme weather events**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/himalayas-more-prone-to-extreme-weather-events), often intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent and severe. New threats like [**heat waves**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/heat-waves-and-heat-index#:~:text=Heat%20wave%20is%20considered%20if,C%20to%206.4%C2%B0C.) are emerging, and even more concerning is the rise of **multi-hazard disasters**, leading to cascading effects and far greater destruction. In this critical scenario, reactive measures are no longer enough. India needs a **proactive approach** that prioritizes disaster preparedness. ### What is the Framework Related to Disaster Management in India? - **Disaster Management Act of 2005:** The [**Disaster Management Act of 2005**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/disaster-management-act-2005-invoked) has provided the legal and institutional framework for disaster management in India at national, state and district levels. - While the **primary responsibility of disaster management rests with the States**, the Central Government supports the efforts of State Governments by providing logistical and financial support. - **Institutional Framework under Disaster Management Act of 2005** : - **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA):** Apex body headed by the **Prime Minister,** responsible for policy, plan, and guideline formulation for disaster management (DM). - NDMA addresses both **natural and man-made disasters** and coordinates enforcement and implementation. - **National Executive Committee (NEC):** Assists NDMA, chaired by the Union **Home Secretary,** comprising various secretaries and officials. - Prepares and monitors the National Plan for DM and coordinates responses to disaster situations. - **State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA):** Headed by the **Chief Minister,** responsible for state-level DM policies and plans, coordinating implementation, and integrating mitigation measures in state development plans. - **District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA):** Led by the **District Collector** with an elected representative as Co-Chairperson. - Prepares and implements district-level DM plans and ensures compliance with national and state policies. - **Local Authorities:** Includes **[Panchayati Raj Institutions](https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/panchayati-raj-institution-pri), [Municipalities](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/urban-local-government-in-india)**, **District and Cantonment Boards**, and Town Planning Authorities.

Over **40 million hectares (12% of land)** are prone to floods and river erosion. It is getting exacerbated by [**Glacial Lake Outburst Floods.**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/glacial-lake-outburst-flood#:~:text=A%20glacial%20lake%20outburst%20flood,or%20the%20inflow%20of%20meltwater.) - **Examples:** Floods in **Bihar (2023), Assam** (2022) - **Cyclones and Storms**: India's coastline is susceptible to cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Of the **7,516 km long coastline**, approximately **5,700 km** is vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis. - **Examples: [Cyclone Biparjoy](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/india-s-cyclone-preparedness) (2023)** and **[Cyclone Fani](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-fani) (2019).** - **Earthquakes:** India is located in a seismically active region, with several fault lines running across the country. 58.6% of the landmass is prone to moderate to very high intensity earthquakes. - **Examples:** Earthquake in **Mizoram** (2022), Earthquake in **Sikkim** (2011) - **Droughts:** Prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall patterns can lead to severe [**droughts,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/drought-in-europe) affecting agriculture and water resources. **68%** of the cultivable area is susceptible to drought. - **Examples:** Drought in 66% of **Maharashtra** (2024). - **Landslides:** Hilly and mountainous regions in India are prone to [**landslides**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/landslide-atlas-of-india#:~:text=Landslides%20are%20natural%20disasters%20occurring,slope%20is%20termed%20a%20landslide.), especially during heavy rainfall or earthquakes. India is considered among the top five landslide-prone countries globally. - **Examples:** Landslides in **Himachal Pradesh (** 2023), Landslides in **Manipur** (2022). - **Heat Waves:** Rising temperatures and prolonged periods of high heat can lead to life-threatening heat waves. - **Examples:** Heat waves across India (2022, 2023, 2024). - The country reported **280 heat wave days** from 11th March- 18th May, 2022. - **Forest Fires:** Dry conditions and human activities can contribute to [**forest fires,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/forest-fires-9#:~:text=Also%20called%20bush%20or%20vegetation,e.g.%2C%20wind%2C%20topography).) causing environmental damage and air pollution. Based on the forest inventory records, **54.40% of forests in India** are exposed to occasional fires - **Examples:** Forest fires in **Himachal Pradesh (2024)** and Forest fires in **Goa** (2023). - **Industrial and Chemical Accidents:** India's growing industrial sector and improper handling of hazardous materials can lead to industrial and chemical accidents. - **Examples:** Chemical spill in **Surat** (2023), Industrial fire in **Mumbai** (2024). ### What Factors are Exacerbating India‚Äôs Disaster Risk? - **Urbanization and Unplanned Development:** Rapid urbanization and unplanned development in cities have increased the vulnerability to disasters like floods and earthquakes. - **Example:** The **2023 Chennai floods** were attributed to unchecked development and encroachment on water bodies and wetlands. - **Rising Climate Change Impact:** Climate change is amplifying the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, and droughts. - **Example**: The devastating [**Cyclone Amphan in 2020**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-amphan) was fueled by warmer ocean temperatures due to climate change. - **Aging Infrastructure and Lack of Maintenance:** India's aging infrastructure, such as **dams, bridges, and buildings, coupled** with inadequate maintenance, increases the risk of disasters. - The **Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water** in 2023 raised concerns over the safety of aging dams that are **more than 100 years old.** - **Environmental Degradation:** Activities like **deforestation, mining, and unsustainable land-use practices** have increased the risk of landslides and soil erosion. - **Example:** The [**2022 Joshimath land subsidence crisis**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/joshimath-land-subsidence) in Uttarakhand was attributed to unregulated construction and mining activities. - **Industrial and Technological Hazards:** India's growing industrialization and reliance on hazardous materials increase the risk of industrial accidents and chemical disasters. - **Example:** The gas leak at a chemical plant in **Visakhapatnam** (2020) exposed thousands to toxic fumes. ### What Measures Should India Adopt to Reduce Disaster Risk and Enhance Disaster Preparedness? - **Establish Dedicated Disaster Response Corridors:** Designate and develop dedicated disaster response corridors, including **road networks, rail links, and air routes,** to ensure uninterrupted access for emergency services and aid during disasters. - These corridors could be designed to be resilient to hazards and equipped with necessary infrastructure and resources for efficient disaster response. - **Promote Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure:** Mandate the adoption of disaster-resilient design and construction principles for all critical infrastructure projects, such as bridges, dams, power plants, and communication networks. - Implementing **stricter building codes** that mandate disaster-resistant construction using **earthquake-proof materials, fire-proof materials and wind-resistant designs**. - Additionally, offering tax breaks and financial assistance for retrofitting existing structures to improve their resilience. - **Develop Disaster-Resilient Agricultural Practices:** Promote the adoption of disaster-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crops, precision farming, and soil conservation techniques. - Learning from successful examples like **Burkina Faso's Zai pit farming technique,** which enhances soil moisture retention and crop yields during droughts. - **Promote Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR):** Integrate ecosystem-based approaches into disaster risk reduction strategies by conserving, restoring, and sustainably managing natural ecosystems like **forests, [wetlands](http://wetlands), and coastal habitats.** - These ecosystems can act as **natural barriers against hazards like floods, storms, and landslides,** while also providing co-benefits like carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. - **Strengthen Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems:** Develop robust, integrated early warning systems that can detect and provide timely alerts for multiple hazards, such as cyclones, floods, heatwaves, and landslides. - Leveraging advanced technologies like **[remote sensing](https://www.drishtiias.com/current-affairs-news-analysis-editorials/news-editorials/2023-05-12), AI, and [big data analytics](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper3/big-data-1)** to improve hazard monitoring, forecasting, and risk communication. - **Micronet Grids for Critical Infrastructure:** Establish localized, self-sufficient power grids powered by renewable sources like solar and micro-hydro for critical infrastructure like hospitals and communication systems. - This ensures continued functionality even during widespread power outages caused by disasters. - **Mental Health Response Teams:** Integrating mental health professionals into disaster response efforts to provide **psychological support** to survivors dealing with trauma, anxiety, and displacement. This can significantly improve long-term recovery outcomes. - **Enhanced Institutional Capacity:** The institutions must hire permanent workforce rather than contractual. - A permanent workforce allows for continuous **skill development, knowledge transfer, and institutional memory.** - This fosters a more capable disaster management system compared to relying on temporary staff who may lack experience. - Moreover, the Local bodies should be allocated a substantial **Disaster Readiness Reserve to complement disaster reactivity to proactive measures.** | | | --- | | **_Drishti Mains Question:_** Examine the factors contributing to India's increasing vulnerability to disasters.What measures should India adopt to enhance its disaster preparedness?? | ### UPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question (PYQ) ### _Mains:_ **Q.** Discuss the recent measures initiated in disaster management by the Government of India departing from the earlier reactive approach. **(2020)** **Q.** Vulnerability is an essential element for defining disaster impacts and its threat to people.

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens‚Äô right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016‚Äîthe Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government‚Äôs response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India‚Äôs crowd-control measures‚Äîissues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right ‚Äúto assemble peaceably and without arms.‚Äù This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain ‚Äúreasonable restrictions‚Äù on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‚Äòpublic order‚Äô and ‚Äòpolice‚Äô under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state‚Äôs police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people‚Äîas a result of a sudden event or incident‚Äîthat poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined‚Äîi.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police‚Äôs _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India‚Äôs history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner‚Äîeither showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee‚Äîset up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest‚Äîstated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, ‚ÄúIt is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.‚Äù [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was ‚Äúdistressing‚Äù that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that ‚Äústates should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.‚Äù [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, ‚ÄúOur established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.‚Äù [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country‚Äôs internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs‚Äô Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, ‚ÄúFormations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.‚Äù [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob‚Äôs movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D‚Äôs 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs‚Äô strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel‚Äôs use of ‚Äúnon-lethal‚Äù pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the ‚Äúless-lethal‚Äù alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‚ÄòStandard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures‚Äù released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as ‚Äúnon-lethal‚Äù weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‚Äòplastic bullets for mob dispersal‚Äô. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have ‚Äúnot yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.‚Äù [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field‚Äîit also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, ‚Äúthe use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life‚Äù. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring ‚Äúother possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.‚Äù In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‚ÄòBasic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials‚Äô. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible ‚Äúapply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms‚Äù. Most importantly, the basic principles state that ‚Äúwhenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.‚Äù [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India‚Äôs tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India‚Äôs democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces‚Äô aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year‚Äôs events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, ‚ÄúPolice Organisation in India‚Äù, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

According to **Swiss Re‚Äôs 2023 analysis, India suffered economic losses amounting to $12 billion (over ‚Çπ1 lakh crore) in 2023**, surpassing the 10-year average of $8 billion (2013-2022). Key disasters such as Cyclones Biparjoy and Michaung, as well as devastating floods, underscore the need for robust disaster management strategies. With floods alone accounting for 63% of total annual economic losses, there is a pressing need for improved preparedness, response mechanisms, and long-term mitigation measures. ###### **Admission Open for UPSC Prelims Revision Batch Starts from 13th January 2025 [: https://bit.ly/4jciwCi](http://%20https//bit.ly/4jciwCi)** * * * #### **Table of Contents** 1. **Introduction to Natural Disasters in India** 2. **Major Disasters and Their Impacts (2023)** 3. **Industrial and Urban Vulnerability** 4. **Disaster Management in India** 5. **Challenges in Disaster Management** 6. **Global Best Practices in Disaster Management** 7. **Steps Taken for Disaster Management in India** 8. **Way Forward** 9. **Conclusion** * * * ##### **Introduction to Natural Disasters in India** India‚Äôs geographical diversity makes it prone to a range of natural disasters, including cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and droughts. According to the **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), about 58.6% of India‚Äôs landmass is vulnerable to earthquakes, 12% to floods, and 8% to cyclones**. This vulnerability, coupled with unplanned urbanization, deforestation, and climate change, exacerbates the scale and impact of disasters. The economic implications are equally significant, with losses mounting annually due to inadequate preparedness and mitigation measures. ###### **Daily Current Affairs available here: [https://bit.ly/3C4SAYw](https://bit.ly/3C4SAYw)** India‚Äôs history of catastrophic events, such as the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the 2013 Uttarakhand floods, highlights the urgent need for a resilient disaster management framework. The increasing frequency and intensity of disasters due to climate change further emphasize the importance of a proactive approach. ###### **ALSO READ- [https://upscguide.in/gender-violence-in-india-social-justice-gs2-upsc](https://upscguide.in/gender-violence-in-india-social-justice-gs2-upsc)** * * * ##### **Major Disasters and Their Impacts (2023)** ##### **Cyclone Biparjoy (June 16, 2023)** -

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

    "full_text": "by [Gyana Swain](https://www.csoonline.com/profile/gyana-swain-2/) # Chinese hackers breached critical infrastructure globally using enterprise network gear News Sep 29, 20255 mins Cyberattacks[Security](https://www.csoonline.com/security/) ## RedNovember group exploited VPN appliances and firewalls to hit defense contractors, government agencies, and manufacturers in a year-long espionage campaign. Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. ‚ÄúThe group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,‚Äù the report added. Recorded Future‚Äôs Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances ‚Äì flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger‚Äôs Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare‚Äôs Warp, to manage their infrastructure. ‚ÄúRedNovember‚Äôs strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,‚Äù researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. ‚ÄúThe timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,‚Äù the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember ‚Äúwill almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,‚Äù researchers added in the report.

Several of these involved more than 1,000 MW losses in large renewable complexes, due to inadequate reactive support and fault ride failures. [SaurEnergy News Bureau](https://www.saurenergy.com/author/sponsored-feature) 18 Sep 2025 09:46 IST [Follow Us](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEP0Wo6yI9KdK0c3Y-1aUSvgqFAgKIhD9FqOsiPSnStHN2PtWlEr4/sections/CAQqKggAIhD9FqOsiPSnStHN2PtWlEr4KhQICiIQ_RajrIj0p0rRzdj7VpRK-DDz3MsL?ceid=IN:en&oc=3) After Iberian Blackout, India Stresses Timely Transmission Rollout for RE Evacuation Spain and Portugal‚Äôs April 2025 blackout, which cut 12,800 MW of power and left the Iberian grid disconnected from continental Europe, has prompted Powergrid to draw lessons for India‚Äôs rapidly expanding renewable-heavy system. With India already facing 68 renewable generation loss events in three years, officials warn that insufficient reactive power, inverter failures, and poor voltage control could trigger similar large-scale disturbances unless preventive measures are enforced. Advertisment On April 28, 2025, the [Spanish](https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-news/spanish-grid-collapse-places-spotlight-on-grid-resilience-diversified-sourcing) and Portuguese electricity grids collapsed, causing a total voltage outage and disconnecting the region from the continental European grid. These lessons are particularly relevant for India, which is undergoing a transition toward higher shares of variable renewable energy (VRE). Due to this, Spain and Portugal faced public outrage, as the country reeled from low tolerance toward grid frequency disturbances. ## **The Incident** At the time, Spain and Portugal were experiencing low demand alongside very high renewable penetration‚Äî82% in Spain and 91% in Portugal. Voltage fluctuations, high voltages, and low-frequency oscillations led to a sudden voltage spike. This triggered large-scale generation disconnections, which in turn worsened the overvoltage situation and caused a blackout within 20 seconds. The outage also forced many conventional power plants offline due to both planned and unplanned shutdowns. According to Powergrid‚Äôs report, around 7,400 MW of gas and 3,000 MW of nuclear capacity went offline, taking the total outage to 12,800 MW. Advertisment ## **Factors Behind Grid Instability** Minutes of a [meeting](https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/v2/D561FAQGHfHA9kVBwnw/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/B56ZlHtshaHkAY-/0/1757844800292?e=1758758400&v=beta&t=MtbV6HoBbDJxxxqvM5jAh5ptlOjXgPtB7XTpGONAoVs) chaired by the Secretary (Power) on August 27, 2025, revealed that insufficient reactive power and voltage control, poor damping of oscillations, and cascade tripping due to overvoltage were the root causes of the blackout. Restoration was initiated through black starts at hydro and gas stations, supported by neighboring countries. Full restoration took around 19 hours. Sometime ago, India faced a similar situation. [Grid-India](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=+Grid-India+) noted that the Indian system has faced around 68 instances of renewable generation loss over the past three years. Several of these involved more than 1,000 MW losses in large renewable complexes, mainly due to inadequate reactive support and fault ride-through failures. Low-frequency oscillations triggered by controller interactions were also observed during high renewable generation periods. Reactive power support refers to the management and provision of reactive power to ensure the grid operates reliably and efficiently. This is typically achieved using devices like: - **Capacitor banks** ‚Äì to supply reactive power - **Synchronous condensers** ‚Äì to generate or absorb reactive power - **Static VAR compensators (SVCs)** ‚Äì for dynamic voltage control Advertisment Grid-India noted that compliance efforts have already improved stability, reducing the frequency and magnitude of renewable tripping events. Highlighting some past experience, the report noted, \"Between January 2022 and June 2025, 68 major generation loss events were recorded. Of these, 41 occurred between January 2022 and December 2023, with the largest loss at 7,100 MW. Another 27 events occurred between January 2024 and June 2025, with the maximum loss at 4,930 MW,\" the report added. ## **Case Study: Bhadla, Rajasthan** The study noted one such major incident in Bhadla, Rajasthan, that caused widespread grid disturbance. Following an R-B phase fault on the 220 kV Bhadla‚ÄìClean Solar Power line, about 6,157 MW of generation was lost‚Äî5,807 MW from solar and 350 MW from wind. The fault caused a voltage dip at the 400 kV [Bhadla](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=Bhadla) substation, and most inverters failed to recover within one second. The subsequent reduction in generation offloaded the EHV network, leading to sustained overvoltage, further losses under high-voltage ride-through (HVRT) conditions, and tripping of multiple transmission lines. The frequency dropped by 0.7 Hz, triggering under-frequency load shedding of roughly 750 MW. Advertisment ## **Preventive Measures for India** To prevent similar conditions, a recent Ministry of Power (MoP) meeting concluded several key recommendations: - Stricter enforcement of VRE compliance verification at both ISTS and InSTS levels. - Periodic testing and tuning of controllers for all grid elements. - Timely commissioning of transmission systems for renewable evacuation. - Augmentation of intra-state transmission capacity. - Ensuring flexibility and adequacy of generation through the timely deployment of energy storage systems. The report added that India is working to address challenges associated with the large-scale integration of inverter-based resources such as renewables, [battery storage](https://www.saurenergy.com/search?title=battery+storage), electrolyzers, and data centers.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India‚Äôs territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group‚Äôs success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade.

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing‚Äôs Ministry of State Security and People‚Äôs Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India‚Äôs [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots‚Äîsuch as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait‚Äîby threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang‚Äôs weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra‚Äôs alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam‚ÄìChina cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other‚Äôs resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan‚Äôs government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan‚Äôs energy grid or South Korea‚Äôs financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today‚Äôs coercion in Asia could become tomorrow‚Äôs global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region‚Äôs growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action‚Äîand by then it may be too late.

Late on May 12, India and Pakistan's directors general of military operations spoke by phone, days after India and Pakistan on May 10 agreed to a ceasefire after coming close to full-blown conflict. The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two...",

India's power grid embraces AI for a smarter, more secure energy future. SHARE India is embarking on a strategic shift in its power sector, preparing to embed artificial intelligence deep into the operations of its national electricity grid. This move, announced by senior officials, aims to enable real-time risk detection, fault prediction, and market surveillance, moving beyond AI‚Äôs traditional role in forecasting. The initiative is a response to the growing complexity of the grid, which is set to handle over 500 gigawatts of renewable energy before 2030, requiring machine-speed decision-making to maintain stability and security. ### A Grid Under Pressure India is poised to undertake a fundamental transformation of its national power grid, the largest unified grid in the world, by integrating artificial intelligence into its core operations. This strategic pivot, a significant departure from the current use of AI primarily for forecasting, is designed to create a data-rich, intelligent system capable of real-time risk detection, fault prediction, and even market manipulation surveillance. The move comes as the nation rapidly scales up its renewable energy capacity, which is projected to exceed 500 gigawatts (GW) before 2030, introducing unprecedented levels of variability and complexity into the grid. At a recent energy conference, Samir Chandra Saxena, chairman and managing director of Grid India, articulated the urgency of this shift. > ‚ÄúThe grid‚Äôs physical and digital layers are now inseparable, as variability increases, we can‚Äôt depend on post-fault analysis alone AI must give us situational awareness before faults propagate.‚Äù he said. > [India to Honour Top CISOs from Police, Law Enforcement, and Defence Forces](https://the420.in/india-to-honour-top-cisos-police-law-enforcement-defence-2025/) This new phase will utilize AI to process real-time streaming data at a 40-millisecond resolution, a dramatic leap from the current reactive operational philosophy. The goal is to track emerging instability across the network and trigger pre-emptive, corrective actions in seconds, not minutes, averting cascading outages before they can occur. This proactive approach is deemed essential for managing a grid with a growing share of intermittent energy sources like solar and wind, as well as new complexities from electric vehicle load spikes and green hydrogen clusters. ### AI to Serve as Grid‚Äôs Digital Backbone Against New Threats The digitalization of India‚Äôs grid, while crucial for the energy transition, has also opened it up to a new array of threats. Officials warn of rising cybersecurity and market integrity risks, as the national grid becomes increasingly interconnected with regional markets, gas pipelines, cross-border trade platforms, and financial derivatives. AI is being positioned as a key defensive layer against these emerging vectors of risk. AI-driven systems will be deployed to monitor behavioral patterns of market participants, scrutinizing simultaneous positions in physical power, fuel supply, and financial contracts to detect potential manipulative behavior or insider collusion. In parallel, AI-driven threat hunting and behavioral analytics will be introduced to combat malware or coordinated cyberattacks on the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that underpin the grid‚Äôs operations. ‚ÄúWe are seeing the threat perimeter blur,‚Äù Mr. Saxena noted. > ‚ÄúA cyber-attack or price manipulation at one node can ripple across the system in seconds. AI will be essential to watch for patterns humans can‚Äôt spot in real time.‚Äù The integration of AI, therefore, is not merely an efficiency measure but a core component of national security for critical infrastructure. ### Building Trust and Accountability in an Automated Future The planned AI integration, while promising, also brings its own set of risks, including false positives, algorithmic bias, and an over-reliance on automated decisions. Recognizing these challenges, the government is preparing a national AI assurance framework specifically for critical infrastructure. This framework will mandate the use of explainable AI models, human-in-the-loop oversight, and clear escalation protocols for grid operations. > [FCRF Academy Invites Legal Experts to Shape India‚Äôs First Comprehensive Cyber Law Certification](https://the420.in/fcrf-cyber-law-certification-instructors-call-experts-honorarium/) Furthermore, there are explicit plans to upskill system operators and control room engineers in data science, AI ethics, and algorithmic risk management. This initiative aims to build trust and ensure accountability in a decision-making process that will increasingly be automated. The framework is expected to draw on best practices from global standards, including the European Union‚Äôs AI Act and guidelines from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), signifying a comprehensive approach to securing and operationalizing this new technological paradigm. The integration of AI, as one senior power sector executive stated, > _‚ÄúAI is no longer an experiment.

Geophysical hazards affect the Himalayan region in the north and northeastern portions of the country where they rank in high deciles for mortality and lower deciles for GDP impact. Cyclones influence a relatively small area of the country but have high-ranking mortality and GDP weighted impacts. Lastly, both the multi-hazard mortality and GDP maps demonstrate that almost the entire country is significantly impacted by at least one hazard and mortality impacts are particularly concentrated in the north and northeastern regions. | | | | ¬© 2005 Center For Hazards and Risk Research at Columbia University | |",

On May 10, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after a series of retaliatory strikes and cross-border clashes triggered by a deadly militant attack on April 22 in India-administered Kashmir, which New Delhi claims was carried out by an alleged Pakistan-backed militant group. Following the ceasefire, India and Pakistan's military leaders held a phone call on May 12 to discuss de-escalation. Later, on May 30, a senior Pakistani military official stated that the two countries were close to reaching an agreement to reduce troop deployments along the border to pre-conflict levels, though no such drawdown has yet been observed....",

Four of the sites were reportedly located in Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, with the remaining five located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Local media reports claim India's military used air assets to deploy standoff weapons, including SCALP/Storm Shadow cruise missiles and AASM HAMMER smart missiles, as well as loitering munitions to target alleged militant infrastructure.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ¬©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China‚Äôs recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries‚Äô territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries‚Äô war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China‚Äôs reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

Some of the most violent attacks conducted by the Naxalites have been against police transport and freight trains, killing dozens of people at a time. The Naxalites specifically inhabit an area known as the \"Red Corridor,\" which stretches from West Bengal state southwest to Karnataka state. The most violent states in this corridor have been Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. The region is defined by rolling hills covered in dense forest and has few improved roads, which allows the Naxalites to control access. The dense foliage also protects them from government aircraft. This Stratfor map shows the areas in India where Naxalite militants operate.",

U.S. officials went public last year with unusually dire warnings about the uncovered Volt Typhoon effort. They publicly attributed it to Beijing trying to get a foothold in U.S. computer networks so its army could quickly detonate damaging cyberattacks during a future conflict. The Chinese official‚Äôs remarks at the December meeting were indirect and somewhat ambiguous, but most of the American delegation in the room interpreted it as a tacit admission and a warning to the U.S. about Taiwan, a former U.S. official familiar with the meeting said. > > * * * > quote: > > * * * > > In the months since the meeting, relations between Washington and Beijing have sunk to new lows, locked in a historic trade war. Top Trump administration officials have said the Pentagon will pursue more offensive cyber strikes against China. Beijing has continued to mine its extraordinary access to U.S. telecommunications networks enabled by a separate breach, attributed to Salt Typhoon, U.S. officials and lawmakers say. > > * * * > quote: > > * * * > > The administration also plans to dismiss hundreds of cybersecurity workers in sweeping job cuts and last week fired the director of the National Security Agency and his deputy, fanning concerns from some intelligence officials and lawmakers that the government would be weakened in defending against the attacks. Officials say Chinese hackers‚Äô targeting of civilian infrastructure in recent years presents among the most troubling security threats facing the Trump administration. In a statement, the State Department didn‚Äôt comment on the meeting but said the U.S. had made clear to Beijing it will ‚Äútake actions in response to Chinese malicious cyber activity,‚Äù describing the hacking as ‚Äúsome of the gravest and most persistent threats to U.S. national security.‚Äù The Trump White House National Security Council declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn‚Äôt respond to specific questions about the meeting, but accused the U.S. of ‚Äúusing cybersecurity to smear and slander China‚Äù and spreading disinformation about ‚Äúso-called hacking threats.‚Äù During the half-day meeting in Geneva, Wang Lei, a top cyber official with China‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs, indicated that the infrastructure hacks resulted from the U.S.‚Äôs military backing of Taiwan, an island Beijing claims as its own, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the conversation. > > * * * > quote: > > * * * > > Wang or the other Chinese officials didn‚Äôt directly state that China was responsible for the hacking, the U.S. officials said. But American officials present and others later briefed on the meeting perceived the comments as confirmation of Beijing‚Äôs role and was intended to scare the U.S. from involving itself if a conflict erupts in the Taiwan Strait. About a dozen representatives from both countries, including senior officials from the State Department, the National Security Council, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies, attended the high-level meeting, which hasn‚Äôt been previously reported. It was led by Nate Fick, then the ambassador-at-large for cyberspace and digital policy in the Biden administration, officials said. In Geneva, Wang‚Äôs comments came after the U.S. stressed that China didn‚Äôt appear to understand how dangerous prepositioning in civilian critical infrastructure was, and how much the U.S. would view it as an act of war, the former U.S. official said. Additionally, the Biden administration wanted to convey doubts that China‚Äôs political and military leadership, including President Xi Jinping, were fully aware of the activities of the hackers, the official said. Both the Biden White House and the Trump transition team were briefed about the meeting and provided detailed summaries afterward, the people said. The Geneva summit occurred amid a cascade of revelations about the extent of China‚Äôs far-reaching and unusually aggressive Salt Typhoon cyber operations into U.S. telecommunications networks, including those belonging to AT&T and Verizon. That campaign allowed hackers working for China‚Äôs Ministry of State Security to spy on the unencrypted calls and texts of scores of top government officials and political figures, including those within the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. While that issue was also raised during the meeting in Geneva, it was largely tabled to focus on the separate hacking into civilian critical infrastructure by Volt Typhoon because it is considered an unacceptable provocation, the officials said. The telecom intrusions, while considered a historic counterintelligence failure, are viewed as more akin to traditional cyber espionage that the U.S. also conducts against adversaries. A Chinese official would likely only acknowledge the intrusions even in a private setting if instructed to do so by the top levels of Xi‚Äôs government, said Dakota Cary, a China expert at the cybersecurity firm SentinelOne. The tacit admission is significant, he said, because it may reflect a view in Beijing that the likeliest military conflict with the U.S. would be over Taiwan and that a more direct signal about the stakes of involvement needed to be sent to the Trump administration. ‚ÄúChina wants U.S. officials to know that, yes, they do have this capability, and they are willing to use it,‚Äù Cary said. > > * * * [Reply](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/message.aspx?action=create&p=118238696) [![replies](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/layout/comm1.png)8](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/display.aspx?sp=118238696&s=4&p=118238696) [...](javascript:void(0);) ![upvote](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/buttons/uArw.png)5![downvote](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/buttons/dArw.png)3 [Report Post](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/requestadmin.aspx?p=118238696&b=50&hpp=118238696) Posted by [lsuguy84](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/users/prof.aspx?u=39336) ![](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/icons/iconUSA1.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/VY3xVyM.jpg) CO Member since Feb 2009 24841 posts [Back to top](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/in-secret-meeting-china-acknowledged-role-in-us-infrastructure-hacks/118238696/#top) Posted on 4/10/25 at 1:18 pm to [Robin Masters](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/display.aspx?sp=118238696&s=2&p=118238696#118238696) Doesn‚Äôt seem very secret now [Reply](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/message.aspx?action=create&p=118238717) [![replies](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/layout/comm1.png)1](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/display.aspx?sp=118238717&s=4&p=118238696) [...](javascript:void(0);) ![upvote](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/buttons/uArw.png)8![downvote](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/buttons/dArw.png)0 [Report Post](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/requestadmin.aspx?p=118238717&b=50&hpp=118238696) Posted by [John Barron](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/users/prof.aspx?u=283012) ![](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/icons/iconUSSpaceForce1.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/ARtCDLn.jpeg) The Mar-a-Lago Club Member since Sep 2024 12897 posts [Back to top](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/in-secret-meeting-china-acknowledged-role-in-us-infrastructure-hacks/118238696/#top) Posted on 4/10/25 at 1:19 pm to [Robin Masters](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/display.aspx?sp=118238696&s=2&p=118238696#118238696) > quote: > > * * * > > according to people familiar with the matter > > * * * ![](https://images.tigerdroppings.com/Images/Icons/IconLOL.gif) > quote: > > * * * > > Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting > > * * * ![](https://images.tigerdroppings.com/Images/Icons/Iconrotflmao.gif) [Reply](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/message.aspx?action=create&p=118238724) [![replies](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/layout/comm1.png)0](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/display.aspx?sp=118238724&s=4&p=118238696) [...](javascript:void(0);) ![upvote](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/buttons/uArw.png)7![downvote](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/buttons/dArw.png)4 [Report Post](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/requestadmin.aspx?p=118238724&b=50&hpp=118238696) Posted by [uggabugga](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/users/prof.aspx?u=282144) ![](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/images/icons/iconUSA1.png) Member since Aug 2024 2528 posts [Back to top](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/in-secret-meeting-china-acknowledged-role-in-us-infrastructure-hacks/118238696/#top) Posted on 4/10/25 at 1:24 pm to [Robin Masters](https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/display.aspx?sp=118238696&s=2&p=118238696#118238696) this is very close to constituting an act of war.

It seems like since they do things deliberately, there is a reason for this to come to light now. Is it because they feel emboldened by the US response to Putin's incursion into Ukraine? Or is it tied more to trade disputes/finance? Or is it a combination of factors? Some unknown cause? Now we have to decide what all we're willing to a sacrifice to keep Taiwan from falling to the PRC. Would the Chinese wait for us to develop chip manufacturing here, thus reducing the stakes of losing the Taiwan chips for us? They want it, we're on record as willing to defend it. Personally, I don't think we have the balls.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we‚Äôve seen this year. But it‚Äôs also important to note that there‚Äôs been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ¬©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

In terms of tariffs against New Delhi, the ball's in America's court. (HARVEPINO/Shutterstock) ## Highlights - _The prospects of a U.S.-India trade war ‚Äî which would be marked by U.S. tariffs on a wide range of Indian imports ‚Äî will hinge on the outcome of a possible U.S. investigation into India's trade practices._ - _India, which recognizes it's a lower priority in U.S. trade negotiations, will be more likely to negotiate a trade package once a new government is formed after its national elections conclude later this month._ - _If India chooses to continue buying Iranian oil, it will buy a reduced amount under a rupee-based payment mechanism to avoid U.S. sanctions._ There's nothing like a common rival to bring two powers together -- at least on defense. India and the United States, both eyeing China's rise with concern, are moving closer militarily. Their common strategic interest in countering China, however, does not mean an alignment on trade: The United States is pushing India to further open its markets to American commerce, halt its purchase of Iranian oil and ease recent e-commerce regulations that could impede foreign investment. The demands, in fact, have even fueled speculation that India could emerge as a new front in U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war. But with limited ability to retaliate, India will seek to avoid any larger trade disputes with the United States, a vital export market. Even so, the prospects for a confrontation will ultimately depend on how the United States chooses to act. Washington has shown it has no qualms about launching trade disputes...

Chinese President Xi Jinping was set to arrive in India on Oct. 11 for an informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mamallapuram. Xi hosted Modi last year after bilateral ties deteriorated during the 2017 Doklam standoff, in which thousands of Indian and Chinese troops nearly came to blows. For Xi, a preoccupation with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war as part of Beijing's broader strategic competition with Washington explains why he wants calm with neighbors like New Delhi. And for Modi, a desire to avoid confrontation with China -- the superior military and economic power -- explains why he wishes to sustain high-level dialogue with Xi.

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

Until New Delhi addresses the underlying grievances spurring unrest in Kashmir Valley, its residents will continue to oppose Indian rule. (TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP/Getty Images) Kashmir is known throughout South Asia for its natural beauty, which draws visitors from far and wide. But beneath the region's alluring exterior, deep-seated grievances are beginning to jeopardize its stability. On July 8, Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, the 22-year-old commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant separatist group that calls for the India-administered portion of the region (Jammu and Kashmir) to join Pakistan. The organization's fighters regularly sustain casualties, but Wani's death set off widespread protests in the state's capital, Srinagar. In an effort to contain the situation, New Delhi temporarily shuttered at least four major Kashmiri newspapers, cut off mobile phone and internet access to the region, and imposed a curfew that has yet to be lifted. These measures have not stopped the demonstrations, however, and clashes between protesters and security forces have left more than 50 dead and 3,000 injured. New Delhi has pointed the finger at...

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners.

On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations.

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....
