SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

    "title": "Q&A: What does India’s Naxal-Maoist insurgency look like in 2025?",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&amp;nbsp; In this Q&amp;A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world. The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it? The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed. 1 So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( see graph below). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026. 2 Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts. 3 Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also targeted locals whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes. 4 What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk. 5 And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so. Visuals produced by Ana Marco.",

Collectively, they account for 72% of global electricity demand. We have ordered these countries and regions according to their total electricity demand in 2024. ## 5.1 ## China ## Key highlights 01 #### China accounted for more than half of the global increase in wind and solar power in 2024 02 #### Clean generation met 81% of the 2024 demand increase in China 03 #### Coal generation rose to a record high in 2024, but supplied only 18% of the demand rise and solar grew more than twice as much China’s electricity demand continued to grow – by 6.6% in 2024 (+623 TWh), down only slightly from 6.9% in 2023. Demand growth was given a temporary boost in 2024: hotter temperatures contributed significantly to [higher cooling demand in the summer months](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/powering-through-the-heat-how-2024-heatwaves-reshaped-electricity-demand/), and January and February showed a rebound in industrial demand from lower levels in 2023, as the last Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in early 2023. 81% of the demand growth was met with the rise in clean generation – wind, solar, hydro, nuclear and bioenergy generation all rose. Wind and solar generation combined met more than half of the increase in electricity demand. Just 18% of the increase in demand was met with the rise in coal generation. The biggest change in China’s electricity generation compared to 2023 was the continued explosive growth of solar. Solar generation was up 250 TWh (+43%) in 2024 compared to 2023, which had itself recorded an increase of 37% compared to 2022. Also of note was the rebound in hydro generation, which was up 130 TWh (+11%) in 2024 as the drought conditions of 2023 eased. China had the world’s largest increase in coal generation in 2024 (+110 TWh, +1.9%), but this was less than a third of the increase in 2023 (+341 TWh, +6.3%). This lower level of growth is significant given the [impact of heatwaves](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/powering-through-the-heat-how-2024-heatwaves-reshaped-electricity-demand/) on increasing demand in 2024. Solar’s increase of 250 TWh was more than twice as large as the rise in coal. In 2024, China’s solar growth accounted for 53% of total global solar growth, while China’s 106 TWh of wind growth was 58% of the global total. Loading data… Electricity demand in China has increased sevenfold from 2000 (1,347 TWh) to 2024 (10,066 TWh). Only 30% of the demand rise from 2000 to 2015 was met with rising clean electricity (and 70% from fossil sources). But since 2015, over half (53%) was met with clean electricity (and 47% from fossil sources). Wind and solar generation has tripled over the past five years, from 629 TWh in 2019 to 1,826 TWh in 2024. Coal’s share has been falling – from 70% in 2015 to 58% in 2024 – even as absolute coal generation set a new record in 2024, 45% higher than in 2015. Despite the growth in solar and wind, China relied on fossil fuels for 62% of its electricity in 2024, making it the world’s largest power sector emitter. Total power sector emissions rose 2.2% to 5,640 MtCO2 in 2024, lower than the average annual growth between 2019 and 2023 of 3.9%. Forecasts suggest that China is approaching the tipping point on coal generation and that peak emissions are on the horizon (read more about this in Chapter 2.3). China accounted for 39% of global power sector emissions in 2024. Loading data… China plays an outsized role in the global electricity transition. It has over half of the world’s coal-fired installed capacity, and is simultaneously home to over [80% of the global solar manufacturing industry](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/china-spare-solar-climate-energy-opportunity/). China dominates the global growth in wind and solar generation, accounting for 54% in 2024, but also the global growth in coal generation, accounting for 74%. Clean power made up 38% (3,836 TWh) of China’s electricity mix in 2024, just below the global average of 41%. Hydro was the largest single source of clean power at 13.5% (1,356 TWh). China’s wind and solar generation hit a new record share of 18% (1,826 TWh) in 2024, remaining above the global average of 15% and overtaking the US for the first time. China‘s clean share and wind and solar share both remain above the average clean share and wind and solar share in Asia. China’s coal share of 58% (5,864 TWh) remains just above the regional average of 54% and significantly above the global average of 34%. In 2024, China was responsible for 55% of global coal generation. Loading data… China’s carbon intensity of electricity generation was 560 gCO2/kWh, down 4.1% from 2023, but still significantly above the global average of 473 gCO2/kWh due to its dependence on coal. China’s per-capita electricity demand of 7.1 MWh was almost double the global average (3.8 MWh) and the regional average (3.7 MWh). China’s demand per capita was five times India’s in 2024. Due to its growing per capita demand and high reliance on coal generation, China’s per capita power sector emissions (4 tCO2) remained at more than double the global average of 1.8 tCO2 and the average in Asia of 2.1 tCO2. Loading data… ## 5.2 ## United States ## Key highlights 01 #### In 2024, wind and solar together generated more electricity in the US than coal for the first time, with coal’s share in the mix falling to an all-time low of under 15% 02 #### Gas generation rose as electricity demand accelerated, with the US accounting for more than half (57%) of global growth in gas generation in 2024 03 #### Solar generation rose more than gas, recording its highest ever annual increase of 64 TWh Electricity demand in the United States grew by 3% (+128 TWh) in 2024, caused partly by [heatwaves over the summer months](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/powering-through-the-heat-how-2024-heatwaves-reshaped-electricity-demand/) and partly as a rebound from a milder summer in 2023 when demand decreased by 1.3% (-55 TWh). The demand rise was predominantly met with higher solar, wind and gas generation, which also made up for a fall in coal generation (-22 TWh). 2024 saw the largest-ever increase in solar generation in the US (+64 TWh). This was the second-largest increase of any country, after China. Significant capacity additions spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act have begun to feed through to generation increases. Wind generation rose as a result of improved wind conditions from 2023 as well as a moderate increase in wind capacity. Gas generation in the US increased by 3.3% (+59 TWh). This was the largest rise in gas generation seen in any country in 2024 and more than half (57%) of the global increase in gas generation. Loading data… Coal power has been in terminal decline in the US since its peak in 2007. Since then, coal power has fallen by two-thirds (-1,364 TWh). Coal fell below 15% of the US electricity mix for the first time in 2024. Coal power was predominantly replaced by an increase in wind and solar generation (+722 TWh since 2007) and gas generation (+968 TWh since 2007). Gas generation rose to record levels in 2024, doubling compared to 2007. The US has been responsible for 43% of the global increase in gas generation since 2015. The partial coal-to-gas switch meant that power sector emissions have not declined as fast as coal power. Since 2015, emissions have fallen by 18%, from 2,062 MtCO2 to 1,683 MtCO2 in 2024. Wind and solar together have more than tripled (+527 TWh) in the US since 2015, generating 757 TWh of electricity in 2024. This continued growth meant that [wind and solar overtook coal power in the US](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/latest-insights/us-electricity-2025-special-report/) for the first time in 2024, generating 17% of the country’s electricity. After remaining largely flat for most of the 2010s, demand has risen in three of the last four years, at an average of 1.8% per year. The growth in clean electricity came only from solar and wind – bioenergy, nuclear and hydro generation were all lower in 2024 than in 2015. Loading data… The United States generated 42% of its electricity from clean sources in 2024, in line with the global average. 17% of the country’s electricity was generated by wind and solar power, which was just above the global average (15%), but lower than China (18%). 58% of US electricity came from fossil fuels in 2024, which was in line with the global average of 59% despite coal’s significant decline. This was due to the country’s reliance on gas power, which supplied 43% of its electricity in 2024 (1,865 TWh). This was more than double the gas generation of all other G7 members combined. Loading data… The carbon intensity of US electricity generation was 384 gCO2/kWh – below the global average of 473 gCO2/kWh. Although the fossil share was similar to the global average, the US has a larger reliance on gas than coal, leading to carbon intensity. The United States was the country with the 11th highest electricity demand per capita (12.7 MWh) in 2024. Its demand per capita has remained consistently high and in 2024, reached its highest level since 2014. Its demand per capita is twice as high as that of the EU. As a result of high electricity demand, power sector emissions per capita were 4.9 tCO2, more than double the global average of 1.8 tCO2. Loading data… ## 5.3 ## European Union ## Key highlights 01 #### Solar power overtook coal generation in the EU for the first time in 2024 02 #### In 2024, the EU saw the largest fall in coal generation globally 03 #### The EU’s biggest two generation sources – nuclear and wind – are both low-carbon, with gas and coal in third and sixth place respectively In 2024, solar was the European Union’s fastest-growing power source, with a 21% increase (+53 TWh) compared to 2023. This rise accounted for 11% of the global increase in solar generation. The EU saw a record amount of new capacity additions in 2024, driving this solar increase despite lower solar radiation in 2024 than in 2023. Wind generation grew by 8 TWh year-on-year in 2024. This growth is lower than the average 30 TWh year-on-year increase seen between 2019 and 2023. While capacity additions continued in 2024, wind conditions were less favourable than in 2023, leading to lower than expected generation. Hydro and nuclear generation increased by 32 TWh (+9.6%) and 29 TWh (+4.6%) respectively. Hydro increased due to favorable rainfall across most of Europe, while nuclear power was boosted because of reduced downtime in France. Fossil gas generation fell for the fifth year in a row (-26 TWh, -5.6%). Coal generation in the EU fell by 50 TWh (-16%), continuing a second consecutive year of decline. This was the largest decline in any power sector globally. EU demand rose by 30 TWh (+1.1%), steadying after large falls in 2022 and 2023. Loading data… The EU has proven that a deep transformation of the power sector is achievable and beneficial. In 2024, EU power sector emissions were down to 585 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), below half of their 2007 peak. Over the last five years, coal generation has fallen by 182 TWh (-40%), with Austria, Sweden and Portugal phasing it out completely, while countries with large coal fleets like Germany saw significant plant closures. At the same time, gas generation has decreased in each of the last five years, and was 139 TWh (-24%) lower in 2024 than it was in 2019. The reduction in gas generation has enhanced the bloc’s energy security amidst Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the gas price volatility seen over the last three years. EU fossil generation is now at its lowest level for more than forty years (793 TWh). The key driver of this has been a significant rise in wind and solar generation. Wind and solar’s share in the EU power mix has increased from 17% in 2019 to 29% in 2024, with wind generation increasing by 113 TWh (+31%) and solar generation by 179 TWh (+143%). Hydropower capacity has remained unchanged over the last five years, with changes in generation dominated by weather conditions. Meanwhile, nuclear capacity has decreased from 110 GW to 96 GW, although the largest changes in generation have come from outages and maintenance. Loading data… As a result of its power sector transformation, the EU has cemented its position as a global leader in clean power, showing it is possible to integrate high shares of variable renewables. 71% of the region’s electricity came from clean sources in 2024, far above the global average of 41%. The EU’s biggest two generation sources – nuclear and wind – are both low-carbon, with gas and coal in third and sixth place respectively. The EU obtained 18% of its electricity from wind power, more than double the global average. Solar provided 11% of the EU’s electricity generation in 2024, surpassing coal for the first time ever. Out of the 15 countries with the highest solar shares in 2024, seven were EU Member States. France’s sizeable nuclear fleet meant that the bloc generated 24% of its electricity from nuclear power, above the global average. Fossil generation provided 29% of the EU’s electricity, half of the global average of 59%. The main difference was a much lower share of coal generation. Coal generation fell to below 10% (9.8%) of total EU electricity generation, compared to the global average of 34%. Loading data… The carbon intensity of electricity generation in the EU was 213 gCO2 per kWh in 2024, less than half the global average (473 gCO2/kWh). The EU’s per capita power demand was 6.1 MWh, 60% higher than the world average and half the demand per capita of the United States. The low CO2 intensity and demand per capita meant that the EU’s per capita power sector emissions were 1.3 tonnes of CO2 (tCO2), 28% less than the world average of 1.8 tCO2 and about one third of those in China and the United States. Loading data… ## 5.4 ## India ## Key highlights 01 #### India’s wind and solar generation doubled in the five years leading to 2024 02 #### India overtook Germany to become the world’s third largest generator of electricity from wind and solar in 2024 03 #### Coal generation growth met 64% of India’s electricity demand growth in 2024, a substantial decline from the 91% in 2023 India’s power demand increased by 5% (98 TWh) in 2024, slightly less than the 7% growth in 2023, and in line with the country’s average annual demand growth rate for the last decade (+5.5%). India had the third-largest demand increase in the world. Clean generation increased by 32 TWh (+7.4%) in 2024, meeting 33% of India’s demand increase. The clean generation increase was in part due to a rebound of hydro (+7 TWh, +4.7%) after a decline of 26 TWh in 2023. India recorded the fourth-largest increase in solar generation of any country in 2024 at 20 TWh (+18%), more than the total solar generation of the United Kingdom. This was driven by record capacity additions in 2024, more than [double the additions in 2023](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2094992#:~:text=As%20on%2020th%20Jan,wind%20installations%20compared%20to%202023). However, lower solar radiation meant that the generation increase seen in 2024 did not fully reflect the impact of this capacity boom. Fossil generation increased by 67 TWh (+4.4%) in 2024, significantly lower than 2023’s figure of 124 TWh (+8.8%). Coal generation grew by 4.3% in 2024, almost half the average of the prior three years (8.8%). Coal generation growth met 64% of India’s electricity demand growth in 2024, a substantial decline from the 91% in 2023. Loading data… India’s demand had been rising by more than 7% every year since the Covid-19 decline of 2020, but in 2024, demand growth fell back to the historic ten-year trend of around 5%. India’s wind and solar generation almost doubled over the five years leading to 2024, from 110 TWh to 215 TWh. As a result, India overtook Germany in 2024 to become the world’s third largest generator of electricity from wind and solar. Hydro generation in 2024 was roughly the same as five years ago, and nuclear power increased by 10 TWh (+21%) over the same period. India’s coal-fired power generation also continued to rise, almost doubling from 2012 (787 TWh) to 2024 (1,534 TWh). In 2018, India overtook the US to become the second-largest coal generator, and now has more than twice the coal generation of the US. As a result, power sector emissions continue to rise, reaching 1,457 MtCO2 in 2024. This makes India the world’s third-largest power sector emitter, although emissions per capita remain well below the global average. Loading data… India is one of only ten countries that is currently planning for a tripling of renewables capacity by 2030 (from 2022), with the goal of reaching 500 GW of clean power capacity. By October 2024, the country had achieved [200 GW of RE capacity](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/navigating-risks-to-unlock-500gw-of-renewables-by-2030/chapter-1-understanding-risks-better/). India is focused on domestic policies that support solar modules, batteries, and electrolysers to support the energy transition, while meeting development milestones such as the recent delivery of 100% electricity access. India generated 78% of its electricity from fossil sources in 2024, primarily driven by coal at 75%. This is above the 66% regional average for Asia and well above the 59% global average. Clean generation made up 22% of India’s electricity mix in 2024. Hydro was India’s largest clean electricity source at 8%. Solar and wind combined reached 10% in 2024. However, this is still below the global average (15%) and China (18%). Loading data… The carbon intensity of India’s power sector was 708 gCO2/kWh in 2024. This is higher than both the average in Asia of 573 gCO2/kWh and the global average of 473 gCO2/kWh. Despite having the third-highest demand of any country, the electricity demand per capita was 1.4 MWh, less than half of the Asian regional average of 3.7 MWh and the global average of 3.8 MWh. India’s electricity is heavily coal-reliant. However, the low per capita electricity use meant that India’s per capita emissions were 1 tCO2, much lower than the global average (1.8 tCO2).

Excluding the 5.7% rise in 2021, following the Covid-19 pandemic, this was Russia’s highest demand increase since 2010. Fossil generation met most of this increase, with a 14 TWh (+6.7%) coal rise and a gas increase of 9.8 TWh (+1.9%). Hydro increased by 9.5 TWh (+4.7%) in 2024, following a 3.2 TWh (+1.6%) increase in 2023. Nuclear saw a small decline of 1.7 TWh (-0.8%) in 2024. Wind and solar only play a small role in Russian generation. Wind saw a 0.8 TWh increase and solar generation grew by 0.2 TWh. Loading data… Russia set a new record for both coal and gas generation in 2024, with fossil generation continuing to meet growing electricity demand. As a result, Russia was the world’s fourth-largest power sector emitter with a total of 544 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) in 2024. Power sector emissions in Russia had been relatively flat from 2013 until they dropped due to Covid-19 restrictions in 2020, but have been on a steady increase since then. Emissions were up by 20 MtCO2 in 2024, an increase of 3.8% over 2023, more than double the global average. Nuclear and hydro generation have been rising in Russia. In 2024, nuclear generation was 10% higher than in 2015, though falling slightly in market share. Partly due to higher rainfall, hydro generation was 25% higher in 2024 compared to 2015. Solar and wind remained a tiny part of the electricity mix. Loading data… Russia has not started its clean energy transition. Its share of wind and solar generation combined was less than 1% of its total power mix, the second-lowest in the G20. Russia lags well behind the European average (20%), China (18%), and the global average of 15%. Fossil fuels made up 64% of Russia’s electricity mix in 2024. Gas made up the largest share at 44%, followed by coal which accounted for 19% of the country’s electricity generation. Clean power made up 36% of the electricity mix with nearly all of it coming from hydro and nuclear, contributing 17% and 18% respectively. Loading data… Russia’s carbon intensity of electricity was 449 gCO2/kWh in 2024, just below the global average of 473 gCO2/kWh. Russia’s demand per capita was 8.3 MWh, more than twice the global average of 3.8 MWh. As a result of the relatively high demand, Russia’s power sector emissions per capita in 2024 were 3.8 tCO2, more than double the global average of 1.8 tCO2. Loading data… ## 5.6 ## Japan ## Key highlights 01 #### Wind power has grown significantly in all G7 countries except Japan 02 #### Japan remained the fourth-largest solar generating country globally 03 #### Japan’s power sector emissions fell by 1.4% in 2024 In 2024, Japan’s power demand increased by 9 TWh (+0.9%), in part as a result of [hotter temperatures in summer months](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/03/japan-weather-august-heat-record-heatwaves-china). Fossil generation fell by 12 TWh (-1.7%). This was much lower than the fall in fossil generation in 2023 (-63 TWh, -8%). Japan’s clean generation growth was led by an increase in nuclear generation (+7.5 TWh, +9.6%) and solar (+5 TWh, +5.2%). Overall clean generation was up by 21 TWh (+7%), just over half of the increase in 2023 (+36 TWh; +13.6%). Loading data… Japan’s power sector emissions peaked in 2012 and have declined 25% since then, reaching 493 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) in 2024. This was the lowest value in the past 22 years, but still slightly higher than in 2000. This is because coal and gas still generate around two-thirds of Japan’s electricity, though in recent years they have been increasingly replaced by nuclear and solar. Solar’s share in the mix has grown significantly in Japan, rising fivefold from 2% of generation in 2014 to 10% in 2024. On the other hand, wind was just 1% of generation in 2024. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the G7, where wind has risen to an average of 12% of total electricity generation. Nuclear generation has grown in recent years owing to the reopening of reactors closed following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Two units [reopened](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/japan-nuclear-power) in 2024. However, due to the slow recovery of nuclear power and the lack of wind power, Japan produced less clean electricity in 2024 (322 TWh) than it did in 2000 (420 TWh). Loading data… Japan’s largest source of clean electricity was solar (10%) in 2024. However, despite significant wind potential, its share of wind is only 1%. As a result, the wind and solar share was only 11% in 2024, below the global average (15%), regional average (14%), and its neighbour China (18%). In 2024, Japan relied on fossil fuels for 69% of electricity generation. This is more than the regional average of 66% and global average of 59%. The share of nuclear in electricity generation was 8.3%, up from 7.6% in 2023 due to the restart of additional nuclear reactors in 2024. There are currently [10 reactors under review](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64204) for potential restart, and the recent [7th long-term strategic energy plan](https://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/committee/council/basic_policy_subcommittee/opinion/2024_public.html) aims for 20% nuclear share in generation by 2040. Loading data… The carbon intensity of Japan’s power sector was 482 gCO2/kWh in 2024, virtually unchanged from 2023, and just above the global average of 473 gCO2/kWh. Due to the lower contribution of coal in Japan as compared to most of Asia, its carbon intensity was lower than the Asian regional average of 573 gCO2/kWh. However, Japan’s emissions per capita of 4 tCO2 were more than twice the global average of 1.8 tCO2 and almost twice the regional average of 2.1 tCO2. This is primarily due to Japan’s large demand per capita at 8.3 MWh. Loading data… ## 5.7 ## Brazil ## Key highlights 01 #### In 2024, Brazil had the world’s third-largest increase in both wind and solar generation 02 #### Brazil has overtaken Germany to become the fifth-largest solar generator 03 #### Brazil’s power sector emissions peaked a decade ago, and in 2024 were down 32% from 2014 Electricity demand in Brazil was up by 35 TWh (+4.9%) in 2024, similar to the demand increase in 2023 (+35 TWh, +5%). Both years’ increases were triple that of 2022 (+11 TWh, +1.6%). Brazil’s demand increase was primarily met by solar (+23 TWh, +45%) and wind (+12 TWh, +13%). Its increase in solar generation was the third-largest of any country in 2024. Brazil became the fifth-largest solar generator in 2024, surpassing Germany in the global rankings. Brazil also had the third-largest increase in wind generation in 2024, maintaining its fourth place globally in terms of total annual wind generation. Hydro generation was down 14 TWh (-3.2%) in 2024 due to an intense and widespread [drought](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6qvpe0dxqo). Brazil’s fossil generation increased by 12 TWh (+18%), primarily due to gas increasing by 10 TWh (+27%), countering the fall in hydro generation. Loading data… Brazil has a high share of renewables due to its large hydroelectric base and the rapid expansion of solar and wind power in recent years. Its share of wind and solar has been growing rapidly in recent years, reaching 24% in 2024, a substantial increase from 17% in 2022 and up from just 5.8% in 2016. Brazil’s power sector emissions peaked in 2014 at 114 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2). Growing wind and solar have since reduced the need for fossil power. In 2024, a decade past the peak, its power sector emissions were 32% below 2014 levels, at 77 MtCO2. Brazil’s power sector emissions have fluctuated since the peak due to variability in weather conditions, with rainfall and drought affecting hydro output. In 2024, drier conditions prevailed and overall, there was a slight decline in hydro generation (-14 TWh) that was almost all offset by rising fossil generation (+12 TWh) such that power sector emissions increased slightly from 2023 to 2024 (+8 MtCO2). Loading data… Brazil generated 90% of its electricity from clean sources in 2024, with hydro dominating the mix at 56%. Its share of wind and solar (24%) was above the global average (15%) and the average in Latin America (17%). Over 87% of Brazil’s electricity came from renewables in 2024, which was by far the highest of any G20 country and almost triple the global average of 32%. Brazil relied on fossil fuels for just 10% of its electricity in 2024, a sixth of the global average of 59%. Loading data… In 2024, Brazil’s carbon intensity of electricity generation was 103 gCO2/kWh, the second-lowest in the G20 and less than a quarter of the global average (473 gCO2/kWh). Brazil’s electricity demand per capita was 3.6 MWh in 2024, just below the world average of 3.8 MWh but above the regional average of 2.8 MWh. Brazil’s per capita emissions from electricity generation (0.4 tCO2) are the lowest in the G20 and less than a quarter of the global average of 1.8 tCO2.

    "title": "Weaponizing Markets: India’s Naxalite Insurgency",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future.

    "full_text": "# US–China Cyber Relations and the Weaponisation of Microsoft Platforms - November 11, 2025 \\| - [Issue Brief](https://www.idsa.in/publication-type/issuebrief) ## **_Summary_** _Cyber tensions between the United States and China show Microsoft’s central yet fragile role in global cybersecurity, where its platforms serve as both assets and targets. While both nations have exploited vulnerabilities within the platform to conduct cyber-espionage against each other, China has been particularly persistent in its operations._ ## **Introduction** Accusations of state-sponsored cyber espionage have come to define the cyber relations between the US and China over the years. The widespread adoption of Microsoft products has also made them prime targets for state-sponsored cyber espionage. High-profile incidents, such as the SolarWinds breach and attacks on Microsoft 365, have demonstrated how nation-state actors exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s ecosystem to conduct sophisticated espionage operations. The same tactics have been deployed by both the US and China, deepening mistrust and diplomatic friction between the two. [\\[1\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn1) In recent years, China, in particular, has increasingly weaponised vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s platforms to execute espionage and influence operations.\\ ## **Historical Overview of US–China Cyber Relations** The trajectory of US–China cyber relations reflect a history of mutual espionage, strategic mistrust and technological competition. Since China’s formal entry into the global Internet in 1994, cyberspace has emerged as a critical domain of tensions between the two powers. [\\[2\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn2) What began as isolated intrusions has expanded into a repeated cycle of cyber espionage, countermeasures and retaliatory diplomacy. Though both China and the US have used cyberspace to gain strategic, economic and military advantages, China’s campaigns, particularly those exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft systems, have been more frequent and globally disruptive. For more than a decade, China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have launched cyber espionage campaigns targeting US government agencies, critical infrastructure, defence contractors and technology firms. For example, the 2005 Titan Rain cyber-attacks, which compromised the unclassified networks of the US Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Energy, stand out as an essential incident. [\\[3\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn3) Titan Rain represented the first publicly disclosed case of state-sponsored cyber espionage originating from China, and marked the first instance in which the US government publicly attributed such activities to Chinese state actors. Another prominent example is the 2009 Operation Aurora, a series of cyberattacks that compromised the networks of Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, and other high-profile companies to steal their trade secrets. [\\[4\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn4) This prompted Google to close its offices and operations in China. The China threat became so evident that, in 2011, the US government’s Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive issued a report naming China as the “most active and persistent” perpetrator of cyber intrusions into the United States. [\\[5\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn5) However, the US has not been passive in cyberspace—it has also conducted numerous cyber operations against Chinese networks and institutions. American intelligence, especially the National Security Agency (NSA), has used cyberspace for a long time to monitor and penetrate strategically. China has consistently claimed that the US is a leading perpetrator of cyberattacks and alleges tens of thousands of intrusions every year on Chinese systems. [\\[6\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn6) In fact, independent research supports the view that a significant volume of global cyber activity originates from or transits through the US-based infrastructure, facilitated by major American Internet service providers. Microsoft’s dominance in both public and private sectors made its software a primary target for advanced persistent threats. As the world’s largest provider of enterprise software, cloud infrastructure and productivity tools, Microsoft products such as Exchange, SharePoint, and Outlook underpin critical operations for governments, corporations and NGOs worldwide. This makes Microsoft a prime target for state and non-state actors seeking to penetrate sensitive networks, conduct cyber-espionage, or carry out disruptive attacks. The historical evolution serves as an essential reference point for better understanding the present stage of US–China cyber competition, in which Microsoft has become both the _battleground_ and the _barometer_ of their technological and strategic contest. The following cases illustrate how China, in particular, has weaponised Microsoft’s ecosystem. The three contemporary cases involving Hafnium, Antique Typhoon, and the combined efforts of Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm 2603 highlight a clear pattern that has been unfolding for years. They show how China’s cyber espionage tactics have not only increased but also grown more advanced and precise over time. These recent cases also highlight a transition from broad, data-theft-oriented attacks of the past to exact, zero-day-driven operations. ## **Chinese Cyber Operations Targeting the US via Microsoft Platforms** Serving as a critical gateway to US government, corporate and institutional networks, Microsoft offers Chinese actors a high-value “window” for espionage and economic theft. Because its tools are so widely adopted, and because many of them manage privileged access, hold private keys, or broker identity/trust, vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s systems are highly attractive. An exploit can give adversaries far-reaching potential: infiltrate multiple organisations simultaneously, move laterally within networks, exfiltrate intellectual property, observe or manipulate decision-makers, or launch ransomware. Chinese threat groups have repeatedly exploited these weaknesses, as evidenced in the cases discussed below. The following sections discuss key instances of Chinese cyber operations targeting Microsoft, intended to gather intelligence and advance strategic interests against the United States. Table 1 outlines the attack timeline, the identified Chinese threat actor, the attack target, the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used, the attack objective, and Microsoft’s corresponding patching or mitigation measures. ## **_2021 Hafnium Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers_** Hafnium, a threat group believed to be state-sponsored and operating in China, launched several cyberattacks on Microsoft Exchange Servers in January 2021. The attack exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, 26857, 26858 and 27065). [\\[7\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn7) By February, the incident had escalated into one of the most significant cyber incidents in recent history: approximately a quarter of a million systems worldwide were exposed, predominantly small and medium-sized businesses and organisations, with at least 30,000 confirmed compromises. What initially appeared to be targeted espionage quickly transformed into a widespread “smash-and-grab” operation. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Centre attributed the attack to a Chinese state-sponsored actor based on observed tactics and procedures. [\\[8\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn8) The Biden administration later publicly accused China, attributing the operation to cyber actors connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and stated that it had exploited zero-day vulnerabilities that Microsoft subsequently patched in March. China, however, firmly rejected these allegations. Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responded to the US-led accusations by stating that the United States, along with its allies, has fabricated allegations against China regarding cybersecurity, with no factual basis. [\\[9\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn9) Hafnium is known to target entities in the US across various industry sectors, including law firms, infectious disease researchers, higher education institutions, policy think tanks, defence contractors and NGOs, reflecting a broad, strategic focus on intelligence collection. ## **_2023 Antique Typhoon Breaching Email Accounts Incident_** In May 2023, Antique Typhoon, a Chinese state-backed threat actor previously tracked by Microsoft as _Storm-0558_, carried out a cyber intrusion that compromised email accounts at roughly two dozen organisations across the United States and Europe, including the US Department of Commerce. Among those targeted were Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and several members of the House of Representatives. [\\[10\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn10) China firmly denied the allegations, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accusing the US of engaging in its own hacking activities and labelling the Microsoft report as “highly unprofessional” and “disinformation”. Active since at least August 2021, Storm-0558 is a cyber-espionage group linked to China that specialises in stealing credentials through phishing, manipulating OAuth tokens and forging authentication credentials to infiltrate the email systems of targeted organisations. [\\[11\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn11) The group primarily targets government institutions in the United States and Europe, with a strategic focus on entities and individuals involved in geopolitical matters related to Taiwan and Uyghur interests. ## **_2025 Microsoft SharePoint Exploitation by Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm 2603_** In a recent cyberattack, three threat groups, suspected to be Chinese government-affiliated, exploited zero-day vulnerabilities to target Microsoft SharePoint servers. [\\[12\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn12) Several organisations across sectors, including government, critical infrastructure and education, have been impacted in countries such as the United States, Germany and Australia. The US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was among the organisations breached. However, reports suggest that no sensitive or classified information has been compromised. The identified threat groups include Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon and Storm-2603. Typhoon is a term Microsoft uses to designate Chinese nation-state threat groups, while Storm is a term it uses to refer to threat groups in development. China rejected the allegations, with Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US, emphasising that cyberattacks are a global challenge that affects all countries, and that China is also a target of such threats. [\\[13\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn13) He reiterated the nation’s “consistent and clear” stance, underscoring that China firmly opposes all forms of cyberattacks and actively combats cybercrime. Linen Typhoon, active since 2012, primarily targets government, defence, strategic and human rights organisations to steal intellectual property, according to Microsoft. [\\[14\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn14) Violet Typhoon, identified in 2015, conducts espionage against former officials, NGOs, think tanks, universities, media and sectors like finance and healthcare across the US, Europe and East Asia. Meanwhile, Storm-2603, another China-based actor, has been observed trying to steal MachineKeys from compromised SharePoint servers. While much of the focus has been on China’s offensive cyber operations, it is essential to recognise that exploitation of Microsoft systems is not one-sided—the US has also exploited Microsoft as a platform to target China to steal intelligence and conduct cyber espionage. However, such instances have been less direct and less frequent. For example, the Vault 7 CIA leak exposed how the CIA developed and deployed malware, backdoors and custom hacking tools to compromise operating systems like Microsoft Windows to penetrate computers and networks used by foreign targets, including Chinese government agencies and commercial entities. [\\[15\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn15) However, Vault 7 was not specifically directed at China; it revealed cyber tools and operations targeting multiple regions, including Europe, the Middle East and China. In a recent development, China’s 2025 accusation against the US alleged that American agencies exploited unpatched Microsoft security flaws to spy on Chinese military networks, reflecting ongoing tit-for-tat cyber operations. [\\[16\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn16) Unlike the Chinese cases, where detailed objectives, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of Microsoft exploitation have been documented, the 2025 Microsoft bug incident has not been confirmed or detailed by either Microsoft or the US government. This shows that Chinese operations are explicitly oriented towards espionage against Western entities, particularly the US, highlighting the asymmetry in targeting focus between US and Chinese cyber activities involving Microsoft vulnerabilities. ## **Cyber Crisis Management** The repeated cycles of accusation and denial following these Microsoft-related breaches reveal a deeper structural problem in US–China cyber relations: the absence of effective cyber crisis management frameworks. While cyber operations have become increasingly sophisticated, mechanisms to contain their diplomatic fallout remain underdeveloped. Crisis management in cyberspace involves controlling and mitigating cyber incidents that can escalate into tensions between countries, armed conflict, or war. The objective is to prevent cyberspace confrontations from escalating into a full-fledged war. Though disputes in cyberspace are low-intensity and involve limited confrontation, the need for cyber crisis stems from the recent rise in full-scale confrontation triggered by cyberspace conflicts between countries. [\\[17\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn17) One of the most critical objectives of crisis management is the establishment of shared attribution protocols and norms. [\\[18\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn18) Joint technical teams should develop transparent, mutually-agreed processes for attributing attacks and reducing the “who-did-it” ambiguity that fuels retaliation. Attribution has, in fact, proved to be a significant challenge in US–China cyber crisis management. China’s increasing sophistication of cyber threat actors over the years has made it difficult to attribute specific attacks to specific actors. This uncertainty makes it difficult for governments to respond to or diplomatically address the situation quickly. Clear communication channels for de-escalating cyber crises are essential for cyber crisis management in the US–China context. [\\[19\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn19) Historically, the absence of direct lines of dialogue during cyber incidents has frequently led to misunderstandings and tensions. Bilateral dialogue mechanisms have also seen limited success. For instance, the US–China Cyber Agreement in 2015 did not fully succeed in reducing the number of cyberattacks, especially in the long term. US cybersecurity experts observed a sudden decline in Chinese cyberattacks after the 2015 agreement. However, they assigned four possible reasons for this decline—the first is the advancement in carrying out sophisticated cyberattacks which are challenging to be detected in cyberspace; second could be China’s use of proxies in other countries to target victims in the US; third could be China’s redirecting of attacks to other countries; and fourth could be that the agreement actually helped in putting a stop in Chinese cyberattacks by conducting an anti-corruption campaign in the government and PLA after signing the contract. Similarly, the US–China Cyber Working Group saw limited success mainly due to mutual mistrust and differing national interests. These past bilateral efforts to institutionalise dialogue, such as the 2015 US–China Cyber Agreement and the US–China Cyber Working Group, demonstrate both the potential and the fragility of cyber crisis management. When formal diplomatic channels fail during periods of tension, academic and civil exchanges play a crucial role in sustaining dialogue. Platforms such as the China–US Internet Forum (2007) and the Cyber Security Track-2 Dialogue (2009) have been successful in building mutual understanding and easing mistrust. Promoting collaborative research among think tanks and scholars enables both sides to address contentious issues more constructively, identify feasible policy recommendations and rebuild confidence. Such exchanges could further help revitalise past cooperative efforts, such as the 2015 six-point cybersecurity consensus, and align bilateral efforts with broader international norms developed by the UN Group of Governmental Experts. ## **Microsoft’s Role in Cyber Crisis Management** Given how deeply Microsoft’s systems are embedded in government and private networks worldwide, its ability to anticipate and respond to large-scale cyber incidents has become a key concern for global security. Microsoft has built a fairly comprehensive system for managing cyber crises. This includes monitoring potential threats, coordinating incident response teams, public disclosure practices, and the regular release of intelligence through reports such as the Annual Digital Defence Report and Cyber Signals. In the aftermath of major incidents such as the Hafnium and Antique Typhoon attacks, Microsoft demonstrated a structured, transparent approach to crisis management. The company’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Security Unit (DSU) usually take the lead, identifying attackers, issuing emergency patches, and working closely with cybersecurity bodies such as the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Microsoft also engages in attribution-based reporting. The company often names the threat actors involved (in cases such as Hafnium or Storm-0558) and explains the tactics and tools they used. This kind of transparency has two significant benefits: it improves global understanding of emerging threats and deters repeated attacks by exposing the methods behind them. However, not everyone views this positively. Governments such as China’s have criticised Microsoft’s attributions, calling them politically biased or insufficiently backed by evidence. Central to Microsoft’s broader preparedness strategy is its Annual Digital Defense Reports (DDRs). These reports compile insights from an enormous amount of data: over 65 trillion security signals processed daily across Microsoft’s cloud network. While they offer a look back at global cyber trends, they also serve as forward-looking tools to help governments and organisations evaluate their resilience against new forms of attack. The 2023 report, for example, highlighted the increasing sophistication of state-sponsored hackers, particularly those from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. [\\[20\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn20) It showed how these actors are shifting towards more covert tactics, such as credential theft and supply chain infiltration. Microsoft’s quarterly _Cyber Signals_ reports build on this work, offering more targeted insights by region and sector, effectively bridging technical threat analysis and high-level policy guidance. Despite its active role in crisis management, Microsoft continues to face criticism over its complex position in the cyber landscape. [\\[21\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn21) It often finds itself both as a primary target of attacks and as a major player in defending against them. This dual role raises a bigger issue: the world’s growing dependence on a single company’s digital infrastructure. When Microsoft is breached, the impact spreads far beyond its own systems. The ongoing US–China cyber rivalry has repeatedly exposed this vulnerability. While Microsoft’s rapid crisis response and transparency help strengthen global resilience, they also reveal how much modern cybersecurity—and, by extension, national security—depends on a single corporate actor. In that sense, Microsoft’s threat assessments and crisis responses have evolved into more than just technical exercises—they now play a part in shaping the global balance of power in cyberspace. ## **Conclusion** The evolution of China’s cyber operations against the United States highlights how cyberspace has become an increasingly contested frontier in great-power rivalry. From Titan Rain and Operation Aurora to Hafnium and Antique Typhoon, the pattern reveals a steady progression from rudimentary data theft to highly sophisticated campaigns that exploit global digital interdependence. Microsoft’s platforms, which anchor both US government and private infrastructure, have emerged as critical battlegrounds in this struggle, reflecting not only their technological ubiquity but also their geopolitical importance. While the US continues to accuse China of state-sponsored cyber espionage and intellectual property theft, China maintains that it too is a victim of cyberattacks, deflecting blame and challenging the credibility of US narratives. This dynamic has created a persistent cycle of accusation and denial, deepening mistrust between the two powers. The cyber contest between the US and China ultimately reflects the broader struggle for influence in the 21st century global order. The Microsoft incidents serve as a reminder that technological dependence can become both a strength and a vulnerability. Unless both sides commit to developing trust-based frameworks and credible deterrence mechanisms, the current trajectory of cyber confrontation could continue to erode international stability and the very foundations of digital cooperation that underpin modern global life.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement.

Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community.

Indeed, the growing rivalry between China and India has an impact on the domestic and foreign policies of the other countries in the region, which face pressure to find a balance between their economic and development interests and their geostrategic concerns.**_ There has been a shift in China’s perception of South Asia over the last decade. From being considered peripheral and of little relevance to Beijing, the region comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka has moved up its list of foreign policy priorities. China shares a border with five of these countries, namely Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan. But the key factor that explains Chinese interest in this subregion of Asia is its contest with India and its strategic relationship with Pakistan, whose support is vital to counter Delhi’s hegemonic position in South Asia. The fact that these three countries are also in possession of nuclear weapons adds a disturbing element to the dynamics of competition among them. Regional trends in South Asia are marked by the dysfunction arising from the confrontation between India and Pakistan; the lack of economic integration among the countries in the region; and structural limitations (like the absence of connecting infrastructure or barriers to trade); as well as changes in governments’ foreign policies with each new election cycle. The Chinese government has capitalised on these failings as it has drawn closer to the region. Indeed, Beijing engages with South Asia mainly through economic measures and trade, and the primary instrument is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Under this approach, Beijing proposes improving the various countries’ investments, trade development and connectivity with China (not so much among one another), in turn trying to isolate India from its neighbours. Furthermore, it has diversified the channels through which it engages with the countries of the region over the last few years, however, adding security, political and cultural facets to its interaction. Prominent among these instruments are arms sales and military cooperation with Pakistan and Bangladesh (the world’s biggest buyers of Chinese weapons); China’s role as a mediator in the Istanbul Process for peace in Afghanistan between 2014 and 2022, and between Bangladesh and Myanmar following the Rohingya crisis in 2017 (Legarda, 2018); or the opening of Confucius Institutes in the region, which has 15 of these centres. The political and economic dynamics of South Asia also reflect the impacts of Sino-Indian competition, as every country feels the pressure of such rivalry. Although China’s presence in the region is a relatively recent phenomenon, the role of India is crucial. Delhi is obliged to juggle its ambitions of greater global clout with being careful not to alienate China too much, while maintaining the edge in its backyard, where it preserves political, economic and cultural primacy in varying degrees of intensity. However, India sees the launch of the BRI maritime route as a ‘string of pearls’ with which its rival is looking to restrict or control its access to the sea through the construction or control of surrounding ports, including Chittagong and Payra in Bangladesh, Hambantota and Colombo in Sri Lanka, and Karachi and Gwadar in Pakistan ( [Faridi, 2021](https://www.gatewayhouse.in/chinas-ports-in-the-indian-ocean-region/)). Delhi’s concern over China’s interest in dominating its sphere of influence by bringing pressure to bear on small countries is no trivial matter. Every country in the area, regardless of its size, faces pressure to turn towards one power or the other. **Dictating a new regional order: India’s perception of China** Since the change of focus towards a foreign policy that prioritises a stable neighbourhood, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has pushed the idea of creating a “community with a shared future”, based on the principles of friendship, sincerity and mutual benefit, in a bid to create an image of China as a benevolent actor (Garver, 2012). But Delhi rejects that rhetoric, as it eyes China’s growing presence in the region with suspicion and is mindful of the contradiction between the words of its neighbour to the north and its actions. Contrary to the official discourse, Beijing has shown limited interest in defining the demarcation of over 3,400 km of border with India, the only country other than Bhutan in this situation. It is no coincidence that neither is a member of the BRI. In Delhi’s view, China reignites the border tensions periodically to throw it off-balance and shape South Asia, as shown by the crisis active since 2020 in the Galwan Valley on the Himalayas border, following a deadly brawl between Chinese and Indian troops. In India they believe that Beijing considers the country inferior, and as such it must never be on an equal footing in the global hierarchy (Menon, 2021). China, meanwhile, calls on India to end its conflict with Pakistan and develop their economic and political potential together, accommodating the rise of Beijing in the region. But in the growing competition in the Indo-Pacific, where India is better placed, China sees Pakistan as a longstanding ally and a strategic partner that plays a key role in the zone, one that can be relied on to promote a new order. Pakistan, for its part, tries to thwart Indian leadership in the subcontinent, as well as Delhi’s aspirations to be a global actor, by using strategies of attrition and destabilisation along the Line of Control – the boundary separating it from India – employing non-state actors (like the extremist groups Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba) to rock India’s domestic stability and divert its attention away from economic development. Bearing in mind Pakistan’s importance for Beijing, these two fronts discourage any cooperation on the part of Delhi. In the face of China’s growing assertiveness, India has felt compelled to seek alternatives to preserve its leadership in the region, including drawing closer to Washington, as it prioritises evening up the balance of forces alongside other powers, aware still of the asymmetry in relation to China. Without altering its preference for creating partnerships rather than alliances, India has come to the conclusion that its previous policy of appeasement towards China failed to temper its neighbour’s conduct. If Beijing was looking to turn it away from the United States, then, it has achieved the exact opposite. India’s membership of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, along with the United States, Japan and Australia, illustrates Delhi’s desire to invite and obtain greater involvement of other actors in the Indian Ocean that help to check China’s ambitions. It is, then, a strategy to manage China’s presence rather than outright opposition, which differentiates India’s view from that of Washington. **Pakistan and the BRI’s success as a foreign policy instrument** China-Pakistan relations have been framed as an “all-weather [friendship](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/esp/gjhdq/yz/2757/2759/202211/t20221103_10799786.html)” for decades, but this bond has grown stronger over the last few years, propelled by India and the United States moving closer, deteriorating relations between Washington and Islamabad and, above all, Pakistan’s central place in the BRI. Islamabad is the biggest BRI investment recipient thanks to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), launched in 2015. It was the beneficiary of over $65bn between 2005 and 2022.1 In fact, the CPEC is the flagship BRI project and aims to connect the port of Gwadar in the western province of Balochistan – an undertaking that began in 2006 – with the Chinese province of Xinjiang, as well as develop multiple energy and transport initiatives. Once finished, it would give China direct access to the Indian Ocean, allowing the Asian giant to avoid the Strait of Malacca, through which [70% of its energy imports](https://warsawinstitute.org/china-malacca-dilemma/) transit. For Beijing, the BRI’s legitimacy hangs on the success of this corridor, touted as the deal of the century. The project has run into obstacles, however. Pakistan is mired in political instability and on the brink of economic collapse, a situation exacerbated by the floods in the summer of 2022 that left a third of the territory under water and damaged a large part of the infrastructure already built. These domestic difficulties have stalled the progress of the CPEC. As [the Wilson Center expert Michael Kugelman stated](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/09/china-pakistan-cpec-infrastructure-economy/), “the reality on the ground is that Pakistan has been slow to complete infrastructure projects and China has been slow to fund new ones”. Given Pakistan’s importance, and in order to prevent defaults hitting Chinese firms in the light of the country’s debt servicing difficulties, China has come to its financial rescue on numerous occasions through state-owned banks and enterprises. Since 2013, that also includes the use of People’s Bank of China liquidity lines2. In 2022, for example, China extended a loan to the value of €2.18bn. In total, Pakistan has run up rescue loans to the value of 9.5% of its GDP and is the world’s biggest recipient of financial assistance from China. Trade only accentuates that dependence. Nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s imports come from the Asian power. China’s major presence in Pakistan, however, is facing a growing security threat on account of the existence of insurgent groups that are hostile to its projects, particularly in Balochistan. This western province, which has a long history of opposition to the central government, sees China’s presence with distrust, both because of the extractivism it promotes and because of the political and economic exclusion of the Baloch people from the planning and execution of projects instigated by a centralist Islamabad. The perception that the execution of certain investments (particularly infrastructure ventures carried out directly by Chinese companies) do not benefit the local population, as well as Chinese interference in Pakistani politics, generates a hostile environment in the shape of attacks and acts of sabotage on Chinese projects or workers. A suicide bombing in April 2022 claimed the lives of three Confucius Institute staff at the University of Karachi. At present, the Pakistani military establishment has most interest in maintaining good relations with China, given that many of its companies are profiting from CPEC contracts. However, the increase in terrorist attacks on Chinese nationals and the links between Islamist militants in Xinjiang and Pakistani terrorist groups – a concern that extends to the situation in Afghanistan and the prospect of regional instability – have raised Beijing’s reservations about its partner. But it has little bearing on the strategic view that China has of Islamabad or on its readiness to prop the country up. Ultimately, against a backdrop of greater competition in the region, Beijing is backing Pakistan, even if the doubts among China’s elites over continued investment may increase if the instability persists. **Echoes of Sino-Indian rivalry in other countries in the region** In 2017, Indian analyst Brahma Chellaney coined the term “ [debt trap diplomacy](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-one-belt-one-road-loans-debt-by-brahma-chellaney-2017-01)” after Sri Lanka surrendered control of the port of Hambantota to China over a supposed loan default. The writer’s description holds that Chinese diplomacy rests on the coercive use of geostrategic economic instruments whereby countries take on debt they cannot service and Beijing exploits the situation to secure a position of advantage, gain control of strategic infrastructure and increase its influence over these countries. The idea serves to discredit China’s action in the neighbourhood, which India views as interference. While the Sri Lanka argument has been since been rebutted3, the idea has taken hold in the perceptions and imaginations of leaders across the world, tarnishing China’s BRI action as a whole. Despite India’s bid to demonise these economic interests among its neighbours, China is sometimes the only available option given the lack of economic opportunities from Delhi or the inability to meet the conditions imposed by international bodies. Other prominent examples of major beneficiaries of Chinese investment besides Sri Lanka are Bangladesh and Nepal, bearing in mind that Bhutan has not joined the BRI and the Maldives has cooled on the project because of domestic party interests and India’s influence. Bangladesh, for instance, is the country to have benefited most from the BRI in the region after Pakistan, with investment in excess of $26bn since 2014 (see appendix table 5). Dhaka’s success is also down to its ability to manoeuvre and tread a fine line not only between China and India – which has also invested and developed similar projects in the country – but with other powers like the United States or Japan, too. Nepal, meanwhile, was one of the first countries to sign up to the BRI in a bid to diversify its dependence on India and attract connectivity and infrastructure projects, particularly after the devastating earthquakes of 2015. Many BRI-linked projects, however, have ground to a halt or are on ice – sometimes because of logistical issues, like the difficulty in executing projects in the Himalayas, other times out of lack of interest of the parties – tarnishing the initiative’s image in the region. ![Tabla_1_A_Ballesteros_anglès](https://www.cidob.org/sites/default/files/2024-06/Tabla_1_A_Ballesteros.png) In addition, there is also the fear that Beijing’s economic sway will influence these countries’ domestic policies. Over the last few years, some political parties in Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal or Sri Lanka have reactivated (and exploited) the power dynamics between Beijing and Delhi to make political gains. In the Maldives, for example, the former president, Abdulla Yameen, who is in favour of a greater Chinese presence, campaigned in a T-shirt bearing the slogan “India Out”.Similarly, in Sri Lanka, China’s shadow pits the Rajapaksa clan, with their promises of China-sponsored economic development, against the president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is more inclined to remain neutral. The latter leader treads a delicate path between not opposing Beijing and moving closer to Delhi, particularly amid the current process of renegotiating Sri Lanka’s debt. Finally, it is important to highlight that, while these countries have capitalised on the contest to reap gains from both China and India (and even from the United States), what concerns them is how these loans and Chinese infrastructures affect the functioning of their governments. The Chinese projects, which come with few conditions attached, contribute to local economic development. But sometimes other factors, like their poor quality, a lack of sustainability, scant profit sharing or debt pressure, make them less appealing. All the same, it is beyond question that China’s growing presence in South Asia has helped to reconfigure the political and economic order of a key region of the Indo-Pacific. **References** Chellaney, Brahma. “China’s Debt-Trap Diplomacy” _Project Syndicate_, January 2017.

The country’s macroeconomic situation was also exacerbated by a series of political decisions in the economic sphere – such as tax cuts – along with the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, triggering an economic crisis caused by those same elites.

When was NDMA constituted?](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/www.vajiramandravi.com#q2-when-was-ndma-constituted) ## **What’s in today’s article?** - Background - Key Events in 2023 - India’s Unique Vulnerabilities - Earthquake Risks - Challenges in Resilience and Insurance - Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach - Conclusion ## **Background** - India has witnessed a sharp rise in economic losses due to natural catastrophes, reflecting both the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and the country’s vulnerabilities. - In 2023, natural disasters caused an estimated **$12 billion** in economic losses, significantly exceeding the annual average of **$8 billion** over the past decade, according to a report by global insurance giant **Swiss Re**. ## **Key Events in 2023** - **Floods in Northern India and Sikkim (July 2023):** - **Affected Areas:** Himachal Pradesh, including Shimla, and Delhi. - **Impact:** Caused extensive damage due to heavy rains between **July 10-15**, disrupting daily life and infrastructure. - **Tropical Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023):** - **Landfall:** Category 3 cyclone struck Kutch, Gujarat, impacting Maharashtra and Rajasthan as well. - **Damage:** Shut down major ports like Kandla and Mundra, causing extensive damage due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. - **Tropical Cyclone Michaung (December 2023):** - **Landfall:** Hit Chennai, Tamil Nadu. - **Impact:** Brought extreme rainfall, resulting in significant economic losses and urban disruption. ## **India’s Unique Vulnerabilities** - **Monsoon-Driven Floods:** - **Contribution to Losses:** Over the past two decades, floods have accounted for an average of **63%** of annual economic losses. - **Monsoon Influence:** India’s geography and climate expose it to heavy rainfall during: - **Summer Monsoon (June-September):** Causes severe flooding, as seen in Kerala (2018) and Uttarakhand (2013). - **Northeast Monsoon (October-December):** Responsible for floods like Chennai (2015). - **Economic and Industrial Exposure:** - States like **Gujarat**, **Maharashtra**, and **Tamil Nadu** are highly industrialized, contributing **36.8%** of India’s total industrial output. These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India’s rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) ‹› Latest UPSC Exam 2025 Updates Last updated on November, 2025 → Check out the latest [**UPSC Syllabus**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-syllabus/) 2026 here. → Join Vajiram & Ravi’s [**Interview Guidance Programme**](https://vajiramandravi.com/all-courses/interview-guidance-program/upsc-cse/) for expert help to crack your final UPSC stage. → **[UPSC Mains Result 2025](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-mains-result/)** is now out. → [**UPSC Notification 2026**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-2026/) is scheduled to be released on January 14, 2026. → **[UPSC Calendar 2026](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-calendar/)** is released on 15th May, 2025. → The **UPSC Vacancy 2025** were released **1129**, out of which **979** were for **UPSC CSE** and remaining **150** are for **UPSC IFoS**. → [**UPSC Prelims 2026**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-prelims/) will be conducted on **24th May, 2026**& **UPSC Mains 2026** will be conducted on **21st August 2026.** → The UPSC Selection Process is of 3 stages-Prelims, Mains and Interview. → [**UPSC Result 2024**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-result/) is released with latest [**UPSC Marksheet 2024**](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/upsc-marksheet/).

More than 10,000 people have died in a decades-long insurgency waged by the Naxalite movement in India’s resource-rich tribal heartland. The insurgency has drastically shrunk in recent years and a crackdown by security forces has killed at least 160 rebels in the first half of 2024, according to government data. “Many have joined the mainstream and you should too. Surrender! Lay down the weapons,” Home Minister Amit Shah said after meeting a citizens’ group from central Chhattisgarh state. “But if not, we will launch an all-out campaign and get success,” he said, adding that the government anticipated eradicating the Naxalite movement by early 2026. The Naxalites, named after the district where their armed campaign began in 1967, were inspired by the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. They demanded land, jobs and a share of the region’s immense natural resources for local tribes, and made inroads in a number of remote communities across India’s east and south. The movement gained in strength and numbers until the early 2000s when New Delhi deployed tens of thousands of security personnel against the rebels in a stretch of territory known as the “Red Corridor”. India claimed to have confined the insurgency to about 45 districts in 2023, down from 96 in 2010. The authorities have pumped in millions of dollars for new investments in local infrastructure projects and social spending.

ASIT KUMAR/AFP/Getty Images ## Summary Indian media is touting the arrest of Gudsa Usendi, a spokesman for a regional committee of India's Maoist militant rebels known as Naxalites, as a significant victory for the country's counterterrorism efforts. Usendi, whose real name is Gumudavelli Venkatakrishna Prasad, served as the main media contact for the Dandakaranya Special Zone Committee's regional command structure. However, the surrender of a key figure within the country's Maoist insurgent movement is unlikely to be a blow to the Naxalites. As a regional-level public relations officer for the group, Prasad was probably not involved in operational details. Moreover, it takes more than the loss of one personality — even a major figure — to seriously degrade a militant network for any period of time. Prasad's true value will have to be determined in the weeks and months ahead, as Indian intelligence and security officials attempt to establish how much knowledge of Naxalite members (and operations in other, more critical regions) Prasad possessed. Should the defected media officer's surrender prove as significant a boon for New Delhi as Indian media is currently reporting, 2014 should see increased arrests, defections and raids against the Maoist organization's leadership and key positions, even as counterattacks erupt in much of southern and eastern India. The arrest of a major Naxalite figure will not necessarily undermine the rebel movement.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Protests broke out in the eastern state of Assam and the southern state of Tamil Nadu late on Monday evening after the implementation was announced, authorities said. There were no reports of damage or any clashes with security forces. Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government [framed rules](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-moves-implement-citizenship-law-opposed-by-muslims-weeks-before-election-2024-03-11/) on Monday to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), making it easy for non-Muslim refugees from three Muslim-majority South Asian nations to get Indian citizenship. The enactment of the law in 2019 had led to [massive protests](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/INDIA-CITIZENSHIP/PROTESTS/jxlbpgqlpqd/index.html) and sectarian violence in which scores were killed, forcing the government to delay its implementation. In Chennai, Tamil Nadu's capital, protesters took out a candle-light march on Monday and shouted slogans against the law. In Assam, protesters burnt copies of the law and shouted slogans on Monday night, and local opposition parties have called for a state-wide strike on Tuesday. Many oppose the CAA in Assam as they fear it can increase migration from neighbouring Muslim Bangladesh, a longstanding flashpoint that has polarised the state for decades. ![Supporters of the Students' Federation of India (SFI) protest against a new citizenship law, in Kochi](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FZFRTH5M7KZP7XJ3T4N2GEAQR6E.jpg?auth=b7da06293f7f995bf8488146a2bb27bec44d2f9c1978f3d67dec8183ec8468b4&width=1200&quality=80) Maximize Item 1 of 4 Students and supporters of the Students' Federation of India (SFI) take part in a protest rally against a new citizenship law, in Kochi, India, March 12, 2024.

Authorities in the national capital New Delhi, where the protests were centred in 2019, were on alert for any violence, prohibiting unlawful gatherings and increasing police presence in sensitive areas. CAA grants Indian nationality to Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians who fled to Hindu-majority India due to religious persecution from Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan before Dec. 31, 2014. Rights activists and Muslim groups say the law, combined with a proposed national register of citizens, can discriminate against India's 200 million Muslims - the world's third-largest Muslim population. Some fear the government might remove the citizenship of Muslims without documents in some border states. The government denies it is anti-Muslim and says the law is needed to help minorities facing persecution in Muslim-majority nations. It says the law is meant to grant citizenship, not take it away from anyone, and has called the protests politically motivated and due to misconceptions that have been spread. Sign up here.

On September 9-10th, New Delhi chaired the G20 Leaders’ Summit for the first time and showcasing its bridge-building skills, marshalled a consensus among the major powers on the Russia-Ukraine language in the leaders’ declaration. The G20 finance ministers’ and foreign ministers’ meetings earlier in the year had produced only a chair’s summary; as such, there were understandable fears that a leaders’ declaration might not be issued for the first time since the inauguration of the G20 framework. In the event, India’s successful hosting drew praise from the United States and Russia alike. Earlier in June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid his second state visit to the United States, where he joined a rarefied list of world leaders who have addressed a joint sitting of Congress on more than one occasion (Modi’s earlier visit and address to Congress was in 2016). Prior to the visit, the U.S. and India finalized a Defense Industrial Cooperation Roadmap and during the visit, an agreement was signed to enable the transfer of General Electric’s advanced F-414 engine technology for manufacture in India. Going one better, during his state visit to France to commemorate Bastille Day the following month, Modi and President Macron agreed to pursue joint development and local manufacture of combat aircraft engines in India. Earlier in the year, the national security advisors of the U.S. and India had held an inaugural meeting of their Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which spans the range from defense technology cooperation to semiconductor supply chains to space and next-generation telecommunications. In May, Narendra Modi paid a first visit by an Indian prime minister to Papua New Guinea and co-chaired the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC). The forum was scheduled, interestingly, back-to-back with Washington’s hosting of its own U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum in Port Moresby, and at FIPIC Modi reaffirmed New Delhi’s participation alongside the U.S., Japan and Australia in a telecommunications network modernization project in Palau. In August, the former service chiefs of India’s army, navy and air force attended an Indo-Pacific security conference in Taipei for the first time, as part of a study commissioned by India’s top military commander six weeks earlier to examine New Delhi’s role during a full-blown Taiwan contingency. The study was itself prompted by discreet American inquiries on the role and contributions by India in the event of a war in the Taiwan Strait. In July, Prime Minister Modi chaired the Heads of State Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) for the first time, consolidating India’s strategically autonomous positioning in global international relations. In a dozen or so votes at the United Nations in 2022 and 2023 on the Ukraine conflict, New Delhi has abstained from condemning Russia despite acute pressure from its Western partners to do so. It even participated in a weeklong multinational military drill hosted by Moscow in 2022. The following month in Johannesburg, India along with its BRICS partners welcomed six new members as part of the grouping’s first major expansion. Of the six new members, Mr. Modi played host or paid a state visit to three of them – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt – in 2023, reinforcing a genuine foreign policy innovation of his premiership so far: a re-equilibration of strategic equities in the Middle East in favor of the major Sunni Arab Gulf monarchies, along with a qualitative deepening of ties with Israel. To this end, New Delhi bucked its voting trend on the Israel-Palestine issue at the UN General Assembly in October, abstaining on a resolution that otherwise commanded a significant majority (120 to 14, with 45 states abstaining) which called for a humanitarian truce between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. In 2023, New Delhi also burnished its credentials with the ‘Global South’, hosting a ‘Voice of Global South Summit’ in January and championing the developing country cause as an invited guest at the G7 Hiroshima Summit. To be clear, the Modi government compiled a less flattering list of accomplishments too. In September, Indian government operatives were credibly linked to the extraterritorial killing of a militant Khalistani Sikh activist on Canadian soil – surely, a new low in New Delhi’s use of power in international relations. In October, a Qatari court sentenced eight retired Indian navalmen, some of them decorated, to the death penalty for espionage activities on behalf of Israel. Although contracted in their private capacities to supervise the induction of Italian stealth submarines into the Qatari Emiri Naval Force (QENF), it is hard to believe that the Government of India’s fingerprints were not present. Also, in October, Mr. Modi paid a visit to a disputed border village on the India-Nepal boundary, a rare prime ministerial outing to a piece of real estate in dispute that is not the norm in Indian or international diplomacy. And earlier in July, the Modi government trashed a Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) order on a preliminary award pertaining to the _Pakistan v. India_ Indus Water Treaty proceedings in language eerily similar to that reserved for the _Philippines v. China_ South China Sea tribunal by Beijing. Be that as it may, the bold brush strokes of India’s foreign policy in 2023 eclipsed the few indiscretions committed. On closer scrutiny though, the brush strokes are much less than they appear to be (aside from the government’s transformative Middle East outreach). India’s decision to abstain on the Ukraine-related votes at the UN General Assembly had less to do with its decades-long friendship with Moscow or some abstract attachment to multipolarity and more to do with its realist interest in limiting Moscow’s strategic overdependence on Beijing. Reluctant acquiescence of this assessment as well as carveouts from the punishing extraterritorial sanctions was obtained from Washington on the implicit premise that New Delhi’s anti-China posture in the Indo-Pacific region would be preserved. The paring down of the anti-Russia language and issuance thereby of a consensus leaders’ declaration at the G20 summit was less a reflection of New Delhi’s consummate bridge-building skills as much as it was a concession bestowed by the United States and the western powers to project India as a successful G20 host. With Xi Jinping absent in New Delhi, the need to project this contrast was all the more urgent. In the Bali G20 Leaders’ Declaration of November 2022, Moscow had been “condemned” for its “war in Ukraine” and its actions “deplore\\[d\\] in the strongest terms” as “aggression” against Kyiv. With Moscow and Beijing opposed to a repetition of the Bali language in the New Delhi Declaration, and with the Modi government staring at the prospect of being the first G20 chair unable to hammer out a consensus communique, the U.S. stepped in and acquiesced to the removal of the references “condemning” Russia and its “aggression” against Ukraine. Tellingly, the Quad Leaders’ Declaration of May 2023 too had glossed over Moscow’s responsibility in deference to Indian sensitivities, foreshadowing the dispensability of Kyiv in the G20 statement so as to project common cause among major ‘like-minded’ democracies against authoritarian regimes. The Modi government’s foray into the Pacific Island nations was motivated less by development-related goals and more as a strategic _quid pro quo_ to ‘crowd-in’ its Quad partners in South Asia, and thus help rebalance against growing Chinese influence in the sub-region. The Pacific outreach amounts, in effect, to an exercise in mutual backscratching with New Delhi reciprocating Washington and Tokyo in kind for their active political and economic engagement in South Asia of late. China has been excluded moreover from all relevant India-inspired initiatives or institutional arrangements in Indian Ocean region – be it the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), the Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) or, for the matter, even the International Solar Alliance (ISA). A single point agenda – the obsessive need to countervail any advantage that could accrue to China on the Indo-Pacific’s geopolitical canvas – was the common thread that tied together India’s diplomatic strategy in 2023. This anti-China fixation, not unlike neighbor Pakistan’s own anti-India fixation, stems from the loss of effective control and patrolling rights over approximately 1,000 sq. kms of disputed territory on the Ladakh Himalayan frontier to Beijing since 2020. This setback also galvanized a more wholesome embrace of Washington’s regional strategy as well as a readiness to stay in Washington’s good graces – to the extent that India’s cherished maxim of strategic autonomy is practiced at times now at the pleasure of the United States. And vice-versa, Washington flatteringly paid lip service to this Indian quest for autonomy so long as it was framed not so much in support of U.S. policies necessarily as much as it was employed in opposition to China’s regional and global interests. **Tripped up by its haste to play the multipolar game on the “front foot”** In November 2019, while delivering the Goenka memorial lecture, India’s external affairs minister S. Jaishankar sketched out New Delhi’s journey from non-alignment to multi-engagement while keeping intact the kernel of non-alignment – that being strategic autonomy. Engaging multiple players in the search for “convergences” was key to maximizing India’s options to widen the strategic space for the country to judge and act on its own self-interest. In a “multipolar world”, he observed, this was “a game best played on the front foot, appreciating that progress on any one front strengthens one’s hand on all others.” Risk-taking was “an inherent aspect” of the process. A decade earlier, his predecessor Pranab Mukherjee had conveyed a similar message – albeit without introducing the risk-taking factor, when he noted that the simultaneous deepening of India’s relations with all the major power centers had created an upward spiral of improving relations with them. Increased cooperation with one power opened the door to wider room for maneuver with the others. He had cautioned at the time though that the essence of India’s challenge lay in ensuring autonomy of judgement so that no one set of relations would be ranged against or be at the expense of another. In Mr. Jaishankar’s haste to play the multipolar game on the “front foot”, this admonition went unheeded. The Modi government’s relationship with China has been based not so much on a search for convergences as much as it has been on injecting ‘external balancers’ – the U.S. initially, and the Quad more lately – into the bilateral equation, with a view to rebalance Chinese power as well as raise the geopolitical cost of the latter’s perceived hostility to India’s rise in global affairs. Aligning geopolitically, economically (in the area of critical supply chains) and militarily with the U.S. and its partners in the Indo-Pacific region would elicit a more constructive approach towards India, it was thought. The outcome has been quite the opposite. Beijing’s stubborn refusal to bend to New Delhi’s will has been informed by two cardinal principles – first, that no amount of pressuring China by standing on the shoulders of third parties will achieve that which can be realized through good neighborly relations in an exclusively bilateral context. And second, that the downside cost of bad relations with China will outweigh the upside benefit of ganging-up with the U.S. and West on China. A willingness to deploy coercive but limited use of force at expedient pressure points along the undefined bilateral frontier, dictated no doubt by local circumstances that the Modi government unwittingly invited, was also key to pressing its case against New Delhi. In this combustive test of wills, the political space to maintain an “autonomy of judgment” on major power relations has evaporated in New Delhi, and a key pillar of its multi-aligned policy – the now-mismanaged China relationship – that was intended to facilitate an upward spiral of improving relations and widen the room for strategic maneuver has crumbled. Strategic autonomy has effectively given way to strategic alignment with the U.S. and the West in the Indo-Pacific region – an outcome not entirely of New Delhi’s choosing. With India and the United States now entering election season, the outlook for New Delhi’s foreign policy in 2024 is likely to resemble more of the same. * * * _This journal article was originally released in the [CSCAP Regional Security Outlook 2024](https://www.cscap.org/uploads/CSCAP%20Security%20Outlook%202024%20-%20Final.pdf) (page 18-21)._ ## Related Terms [China-India Relations](https://chinaus-icas.org/tag/china-india-relations/), [Geopolitics](https://chinaus-icas.org/tag/geopolitics/), [India](https://chinaus-icas.org/tag/india/), [Indo-Pacific](https://chinaus-icas.org/tag/indo-pacific/), [Policy Development](https://chinaus-icas.org/tag/policy-development/), [U.S.-India Relations](https://chinaus-icas.org/tag/u-s-india-relations/) ### You May be Interested In [![](https://chinaus-icas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-29-at-2.43.55-PM.png)](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/viability-of-unclos-amid-emerging-global-maritime-challenges/) - Book Chapter #### [Viability of UNCLOS amid Emerging Global Maritime Challenges](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/viability-of-unclos-amid-emerging-global-maritime-challenges/) - Nong Hong - April 29, 2025 [View Research](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/viability-of-unclos-amid-emerging-global-maritime-challenges/) [![](https://chinaus-icas.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/USCG-Polar-Star-Taylor-Bay-Feb2021.jpg)](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/the-nordic-reaction-to-americas-arctic-posture/) - Commentary #### [The Nordic Reaction to America’s Arctic Posture](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/the-nordic-reaction-to-americas-arctic-posture/) - Nong Hong - April 18, 2025 [View Research](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/the-nordic-reaction-to-americas-arctic-posture/) [![](https://chinaus-icas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Reciprocal-Tariff-Donald-Trump-2048x1365.jpg)](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/no-thaw-in-sight-us-china-trade-war-likely-to-persist-beyond-2025/) - Commentary #### [No Thaw in Sight: U.S.-China Trade War Likely to Persist beyond 2025](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/no-thaw-in-sight-us-china-trade-war-likely-to-persist-beyond-2025/) - Yilun Zhang - February 24, 2025 [View Research](https://chinaus-icas.org/research/no-thaw-in-sight-us-china-trade-war-likely-to-persist-beyond-2025/) STAY INFORMED Subscribe below or email us at icas@chinaus-icas.org to be added to our email list and receive our latest updates First Name Last Name Email SEND ## FOLLOW US [Twitter](https://twitter.com/icasDC)[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-china-america-studies/)[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4dkx1WwGXx9zbwUk8p5KbQ/featured)Weixin ![](https://chinaus-icas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ICAS-or-wh.png) About ICAS The Institute for China-America Studies is an independent nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization dedicated to strengthening the understanding of U.S.-China relations through expert analysis and practical policy solutions. ## NAVIGATION #### [Research](https://chinaus-icas.org/research-main/) #### [Maritime Affairs Program](https://chinaus-icas.org/icas-maritime-affairs-program/) #### [Trade 'n Technology Program](https://chinaus-icas.org/icas-trade-technology-program/) #### [Blue Carbon & Climate Change Program](https://chinaus-icas.org/icas-blue-carbon-climate-change-program/) #### [Newsletters](https://chinaus-icas.org/newsletters/) #### [About Us](https://chinaus-icas.org/about-icas/) #### [Events](https://chinaus-icas.org/events-2/) #### [Media](https://chinaus-icas.org/media/) #### [Support Us](https://chinaus-icas.org/support-us/) #### [Subscribe](https://chinaus-icas.org/subscribe/) ## CONTACT US - ADDRESS 1919 M St. NW Suite 310, Washington, DC 20036 - Email icas@chinaus-icas.org - Phone (202) 968-0595 © 2025 INSTITUTE FOR CHINA-AMERICA STUDIES.

Hunkered inside and clutching their single-barrelled rifles, 19-year-old Chonminlal Kipgen and 26-year-old Paolal Kipgen from the predominantly Christian Kuki-Zo community looked out and scoured the hills of Kangpokpi district for armed fighters from the rival Meitei community. They said they were village volunteers – civilians who had taken up arms to defend their homes. Not so far away in Manipur’s capital, Imphal, the majority-Meitei community had similarly muted celebrations during their most cherished festival, Ningol Chakouba, in early November. For the past 11 months, the two communities in India’s northeastern state of Manipur have been locked in what is arguably the country’s longest-running ethnic conflict in the 21st century under the watch of a federal government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The conflict has killed 219 people, injured 1,100 and displaced 60,000. It has revived an array of armed groups, sweeping up men and boys as recruits from both communities. On Saturday, two Kuki-Zo “village volunteers” were killed and their bodies allegedly mutilated in Manipur’s Kangpokpi district. In their press release, tribal groups accused “central security forces, who aided Meitei militants” of being behind the killings. The conflict is frequently oversimplified as a struggle between the Hindu Meitei and Christian Kuki-Zo communities, mirroring the religious polarisation seen in communal conflicts and assaults on religious minorities in various parts of India. While the Kuki-Zo communities are almost entirely Christian, the Meitei community predominantly follows a syncretic form of Hinduism and their own Indigenous faith system, called Sanamahism. A smaller number of Meitei people also follow Christianity and Islam.

The Assam Rifles is the federal government’s paramilitary force with a long and controversial history in the state. It is the oldest paramilitary force in the country and shoulders the responsibility of maintaining law and order in the northeast along with the army. The Reporters’ Collective (TRC) reviewed the assessment, made in a PowerPoint presentation, late in 2023. The officers who showed the presentation wished to remain anonymous. They took me through the presentation, which was in sync with the views one of the officers shared with me while explaining the reasons behind the Manipur conflict. The presentation put part of the blame on the state government, headed by Chief Minister N Biren Singh, a member of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and his “political authoritarianism and ambition”. It is the first candid assessment from a federal government agency that has made it into the public domain. It is significant because Modi this month, in the run-up to a general election, had asserted that the federal government’s timely intervention had led to a “marked improvement in the situation” in Manipur **.** This was one of the few times that the prime minister had spoken of the conflict. Meanwhile, the federal home affairs minister has placed his faith in the chief minister’s ability to bring peace, which so far has not provided a resolution. The state’s two seats in India’s lower house of parliament vote on April 19 and April 26, in the first two phases of the national elections. The assessment by the Assam Rifles listed causes of the conflict as determined by officers in the thick of the violence. It highlighted the impact of “illegal immigrants” from neighbouring Myanmar, the consequent demand for a national register of citizens to reduce migration and the demand for Kukiland. Kukiland is a separate administrative unit that the political and armed Kuki leadership wants cleaved out of Manipur. The demand for Kukiland has been revived during the ethnic conflict. Additionally, the presentation asserted that armed groups from the Meitei community are equipping people with weapons, and the Kuki community’s armed groups are backing “volunteers”. All of this has intensified tensions and contradicted attempts by both communities’ leaders to present the conflict as common citizens volunteering for self-defence against the other community. TRC could not independently verify if the views in the presentation are endorsed by the Assam Rifles as an organisation. Detailed questions were sent to the paramilitary force’s official spokesperson. Initially, a spokesperson said the Assam Rifles would not be able to respond to something that was “hearsay”. In a follow-up email, the Assam Rifles said it would “respectfully decline to engage in discussions regarding speculative or unverified matters. As a professional institution, we focus on our core duties and responsibilities, and we have no further comments on this issue at this time.” Later, it asked for a copy of the presentation. The Assam Rifles did not respond to TRC’s follow-up emails asking if it held the views reflected in the presentation. Queries to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Manipur chief minister’s office remain unanswered. Hours after this investigation was originally published, Assam Rifles issued a statement saying that the “contents of this article may not be construed as the organisational viewpoint of Assam Rifles.” The statement claimed that “no such presentation has been made by Assam Rifles”. Al Jazeera has independently confirmed that the presentation was made, and has reviewed it. ## The chief minister’s role [![A picture posted on Facebook from September 2022 by the commander of the group Tyson Ngangbam shows him addressing men in black t-shirts with the signature logo of three pony-riding warriors](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/301997710_3293990007537024_7443238836521318647_n-1712926107.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80)](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/301997710_3293990007537024_7443238836521318647_n-1712926107.jpg) A photo posted in September 2022 by Tyson Ngangbam, commander of the Meitei group Arambai Tenggol, shows him addressing men in T-shirts with the group’s logo of three pony-riding warriors. Flanking him is Leishemba Sanajaoba, a BJP member of parliament \\[Korounganba Khuman\\] The immediate trigger for the violence was a demand by the dominant Meitei community for Scheduled Tribe status, a form of affirmative action granting quotas of government jobs and college admissions. It was opposed by other tribal groups, including those from the Kuki-Zo community. But in the presentation, Assam Rifles officials pointed to policies of the chief minister that they believed fed the animosity between the communities. It noted Singh’s “hard stance” on the “war on drugs” and “vocal social media dissent”, among other things, for inflaming the conflict. The presentation accused Singh of creating divisions between communities in the state’s campaign to stop drugs from being manufactured, traded and sold in Manipur. His forceful drive against the cultivation of poppies, grown in hilly regions of the state bordering Myanmar, drove home the impression that he is targeting Kukis. The presentation also cited “state forces’ tacit support” of the violence and the “dismemberment of law-and-order machinery”. Another factor in the conflict, the presentation noted, is “Meitei Revivalism”. Revivalism refers to the long history of the Meitei community aspiring to revert to its identity before the advent of Hinduism in the 18th century and later the merger of Manipur into India in 1949. The campaign led to a revival of Sanamahism in the 1930s and fuelled the armed movements subsequently. The presentation lists Meitei Leepun and Arambai Tenggol, two Meitei organisations, as among the factors that has fuelled the conflict. Arambai Tenggol was formed in 2020 “under the aegis of the titular king of Manipur and BJP Member of Parliament Leishemba Sanajaoba”, a police officer told me. The Tenggol was initially formed as a sociocultural organisation focused on the revival of Sanamahi culture and later took up arms. It earned a more vigilante-like reputation in April last year after it broke into the house of a Meitei Christian pastor who had allegedly insulted the Sanamahism faith. The Arambai Tenggol is helmed by Tyson Ngangbam, who goes by the pseudonym “Korounganba Khuman”. (Korounganba is a common Meitei name that means “sunshine” while Khuman is the name of a clan.) [![In a picture from June 2022, “Korounganba Khuman” Tyson Ngangbam and presumably other members of the Arambai Tenggol were seen posing with Chief Minister Biren Singh. ](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/285341415_3209011726034853_8705829718158294364_n-1712926114.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C472&quality=80)](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/285341415_3209011726034853_8705829718158294364_n-1712926114.jpg) In a picture from June 2022, Ngangbam and presumably other members of the Arambai Tenggol pose with Chief Minister Biren Singh \\[Facebook/Korounganba Khuman\\] TRC sent questions to Ngangbam through his social media account, which he has used during the conflict. The report will be updated if he responds. In January, in a show of strength, Arambai Tenggol summoned 37 members of Manipur’s Legislative Assembly and two members of parliament from the state, including RK Ranjan Singh, the federal minister of state for external affairs and education, for a meeting at Kangla Fort, the palace of the Meitei kings in the heart of Imphal. It included lawmakers from the Meitei community across party lines. Ngangbam spelled out the group’s demands, including updating the National Register of Citizens, a process by which the Indian government hopes to identify and exclude undocumented migrants. The group also demanded abrogation of the Suspension of Operation – a peace agreement – with the Kuki-Zo armed groups, the relocation of refugees from Myanmar to the neighbouring state of Mizoram, border fencing along the Indo-Myanmar border, the withdrawal of the Assam Rifles from Manipur and the delisting of “illegal migrants” from the Scheduled Tribes list – a move that would exclude Kuki-Zo people from Myanmar from accessing the Indian government’s affirmative action policies. The lawmakers committed to back the demands. Meitei Leepun, which is also of recent origin, is perceived as influenced by the ideology of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the fountainhead of a spectrum of hardline Hindu organisations, including the BJP. The leader of Meitei Leepun openly professes allegiance to the state’s chief minister and BJP leader Biren Singh, a Meitei. Both Meitei Leepun and Arambai Tenggol face accusations from Kuki leaders of spearheading assaults by the Meitei community against their people. While Arambai Tenggol leans towards a stronger Meitei nationalist stance distinct from Hinduism, Meitei Leepun aligns with the Hindutva campaign led by the RSS and BJP. A Meitei Leepun leader, Pramot Singh, told me: “We \\[the Meiteis\\] are followers of sanatana dharma. … If Meitei becomes extinct, the last outpost of sanatana dharma in Manipur is gone in the same manner Kashmiri Pandits are gone.” Pramot Singh was referring to an upper-caste Brahmin group that lived in Kashmir but was forced to flee in the 1990s as they faced persecution and threats of violence by Kashmiri armed groups. The Revivalists, in contrast, see Meiteis as distinct from the rest of India with their own cultural and religious identity and an erstwhile Manipuri kingdom called Kangleipak, which was merged by coercion into India in 1949. The Assam Rifles presentation was silent on the political and business underpinnings of the conflict, the role of the federal government – under the BJP – and the Assam Rifles’ own failings and alleged bias. [![Pramot Singh](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pramot-Singh-1712853592.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C578&quality=80)](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pramot-Singh-1712853592.jpg) Pramot Singh is a leader of Meitei Leepun, a group perceived to be influenced by the ideologies of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the fountainhead of the BJP \\[Angana Chakrabarti/Al Jazeera\\] According to the Assam Rifles presentation, the conflict is divided into three phases: “initiate”, “mutate” and “stalemate”. It laid out how the nature and character of the violence have changed through these stages. My reporting over six months helped draw out details of what the paramilitary force’s presentation mentioned and what it left out. ## The initiation The embers of the current conflict – Biren Singh’s alleged political authoritarianism, hard stance on poppy cultivation, undocumented immigration, demand for Kukiland and Meitei Revivalism – have long smouldered. But in April last year came the spark that ignited the simmering tension. This period was referred to by the Assam Rifles presentation as “initiate”. That month, the Manipur High Court had asked the state government to consider petitions for including the Meitei community in the list of Scheduled Tribes – the constitutional provision that in the case of Manipur includes property ownership in the hilly areas dominated by Kukis. The Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act of 1960 doesn’t include all hill areas in its purview. Heeding a call by the All Tribal Students’ Union Manipur, the leading tribal civil society organisation in Manipur, for a “solidarity march” in the hill districts where tribal communities dominate, rallies were held on May 3 in Senapati, Ukhrul, Kangpokpi, Tamenglong, Churachandpur, Chandel and Tengnoupal. As the march was winding up in the town of Churachandpur, news spread that a tyre had been set on fire in front of the Anglo-Kuki Centenary Gate, which was built to commemorate the 1917-1919 Kuki uprising against the British. Subsequently, a group of young people approached the gate wielding weapons. Soon, word spread, suggesting that “militants” were provoking the crowd, Outlook magazine reported. Within a couple of hours, rumours spread through the state that Kuki mobs were vandalising Meitei houses. The Assam Rifles officers’ presentation said the period of conflict starting May 3 was characterised by “high intensity riots”, “selective targeting” and it was “orchestrated and led by militias”. Mobs ran amok in the towns, particularly in Imphal, located in the valley with a predominantly Meitei population. “On the night of May 3 at 8pm, people wearing black shirts attacked us. We fired blanks, which forced them to retreat but just for some time,” said 43-year-old L Ngampao Khongsai, who had been living in Imphal’s Khongsai Veng area, a predominantly Kuki-Zo area. [iframe](https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/24551347-assam-rifles-response-to-al-jazeera/?title=1&embed=1) According to Khongsai, a Kuki-Zo, the mob continued to attack the neighbourhood despite pushback from the security forces. “They would be saying that Kuki should be killed and threw stones.” Khongsai fled with his family and hid at a nearby school. Like thousands of others from the valley, he ran and made his way to the Kuki-Zo-dominated Churachandpur district. In the hill areas and closer to the foothills, mobs attacked Meitei neighbourhoods. A pregnant Warepam Rameshwori was forced to flee her village. “Our village is at the foothills in Tronglaobi Maning Leikai \\[in Bishnupur district\\] surrounded by Kuki villages. On May 3, the firing started. … \\[The Kukis\\] had sophisticated weapons and started firing at us, and we didn’t have any weapons to defend, so we ran away from there and found shelter at a relative’s home,” she said. Seventy-nine Kuki-Zo and 18 Meitei individuals lost their lives from May 3 to May 23, according to an Assam Rifles estimate. This period also recorded a wave of attacks and looting of arms from police stations. According to the Assam Rifle assessment, 5,668 weapons were looted. “\\[The state government\\] allowed the looting of arms. I mean, it is obvious because it is impossible for people to just enter the police stations and take out arms,” a retired police officer familiar with the security and intelligence operations in the region told me. “So the Meitei civilians and the rebel groups had gotten weapons and started maintaining vigilance in the town. … In response, the other side felt that the SoO \\[Suspension of Operations\\] arms people should get out and distribute weapons amongst the Kukis,” he said. The Suspension of Operations is the peace agreement signed among Kuki-Zo armed groups, the federal government and the Manipur government. The SoO requires Kuki-Zo militias to stay in designated camps and all their weapons be kept in the camp’s central armoury under the supervision of the state. “The divide was complete, and that was the stage in the beginning when the political leadership should have cracked down very, very heavily,” the officer said. That did not happen. The conflict spread and mutated, the Assam Rifles presentation noted. [![An Indian army soldier walks past the remains of a house that was set on fire by a mob in the ethnic violence hit area of Heiroklian village in Senapati district, in India's Manipur](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/33EN4UR-highres-1683614623.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80)](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/33EN4UR-highres-1683614623.jpg) The nearly year-old conflict in Manipur has killed more than 200 people \\[File: Arun Sankar/AFP\\] ## More than 8,000 reports TRC tried to redraw the initial period of the conflict by analysing 8,169 first information reports (FIRs) – 5,818 were filed in May and 2,351 in June. An FIR is the first complaint filed either by citizens or police, which the police then have to investigate to determine whether a crime has been committed. On May 3, an FIR was filed recording the initial trigger of the violence between the two communities. According to the FIR filed by the authorities: “A huge \\[number\\] of Kuki and Meitei youths numbering about 1,500 clashed among each other and vandalised and burned down many houses of both communities at Torbung Bangla. In that, many houses numbering about 300 houses and some private vehicles were also burnt down by the rioters. The police personnel fire\\[d\\] some rounds of tear gas smoke bombs and other ammunition to disperse the mob.” The looting of weapons was reported as starting on May 4 with the first registered incident being reported at Manipur Police Training College in Imphal. According to the FIR, “The large mob overpowered the sentry and broke the lock of arm kote room and looted a large number of arms and ammunitions \\[sic\\],” including automatic rifles – 157 INSAS rifles, 54 SLR rifles and AK-47 rifles, among others. The looting of weapons continued until May 31, as recorded in these 8,169 FIRs. In the first two months of the conflict, 7,831 cases of vandalism and incidents in which residents were forced to flee were reported. In addition, 189 cases of killings, assaults – including sexual assault – bodily harm and missing persons, and 79 cases of mass looting of weapons were also recorded. [iframe](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/W8Yp2/12/) Multiple FIRs were nearly identical or similar. For instance, on May 10, 76 FIRs filed in the Sagolmang police station in Imphal East District included a similar complaint: “Some unknown persons holding arms and deadly weapons numbering about 1,000 suspected to be Kuki Community from different villages entered at \\[name of place\\] and damaged the properties as well as burnt the house.” The only differences in the reports were the place names and the lists of damaged items. A similar trend was seen in the police complaints filed by the opposing Kuki-Zo side. “If a village with 40 households was burnt, there would be 40 complaints,” a second police officer said on the condition of anonymity. According to him, the “identical” cases were all combined to help the inquiry being led by a special investigative team. ## The second phase According to the Assam Rifles presentation, the character of the conflict began to change at the end of May. This is the time when federal Home Minister Amit Shah made a four-day trip to Manipur to stitch up a truce. By then, the federal government, in an unprecedented move, had appointed a federal officer in charge of all security and policing operations in the state, bringing the state police and the federal paramilitary and army under one command. The federal government may dismiss a state government and take over control of the state’s functions if it believes “the constitutional machinery” has failed. The constitution also requires the federal government to protect a “state against external aggression and internal disturbance”. But in this case, the federal government kept its faith in the state government and did not invoke either of these constitutional provisions. Again unprecedented, the government sought to achieve a truce by drawing up an ethnic boundary, calling it a buffer zone, dividing the Kuki-Zo from Meitei-dominated areas and enforcing this boundary through its armed forces. [![Villagers on patrol in the Meitei village of Singda Kadangband-](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Villagers-on-patrol-in-the-Meitei-village-of-Singda-Kadangband-1712853608.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C578&quality=80)](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Villagers-on-patrol-in-the-Meitei-village-of-Singda-Kadangband-1712853608.jpg) Villagers on patrol in the Meitei village of Singda Kadangband \\[Angana Chakrabarti/Al Jazeera\\] Shah’s visit and the strategy to impose a unified federal policing command and the buffer zone failed. The violence abated in the main Kuki-Zo or Meitei-dominated towns, but it shifted to rural areas. These rural areas, stretching from the Imphal Valley to the Kuki-dominated hills, are made up of small hamlets, villages and townships where Meitei and Kuki people have traditionally lived next to each other. Now, the villages of both communities came under attack from armed groups on both sides. A battle to forcibly create ethnic territories had kicked off. This phase stretched from May 23 to June 15. On a September night, when I visited the Meitei village of Singda Kadangband, located at the edge of the Meitei-dominated Imphal West district, its residents spoke about the sleepless nights they had spent for the six months of the conflict. About 170 men from 165 households had been taking round-the-clock shifts to stand guard at 10 bunkers set up on the periphery of the village. In early June, the villagers were approached by Meitei fighters. “They came forward to help us, but we didn’t allow them. We are afraid that later they will take advantage of us,” said N Bobi Singh, who had been organising the surveillance. This is when the Assam Rifles presentation acknowledged groups of fighters from both communities got involved. The state has a long and troubled history with more than 30 armed groups from different ethnic communities that call it home. They have fought for demands that range from separate nation-states to the creation of new states within India based on ethnic identities. [iframe](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lATGw/6/) Many of them draw resources from and camp in Myanmar. The influence of the Meitei armed groups, which were particularly targeted by the government’s armed forces, had been waning since the 2000s. And a majority of the Kuki-Zo armed groups had signed the SoO agreement with the government. [Researchers](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/z5C6CYEGBTVoxPFZOSaY?domain=researchgate.net) noted reports of how the Indian armed forces, with the help of Kuki militias, have strategically isolated militia factions from other ethnicities. This allegation, coupled with a track record of human rights violations and unlawful killings, has significantly tarnished the Assam Rifles’ standing within the Meitei community. The paramilitary is perceived as biased whereas the state police have faced accusations of bias against Kuki communities. This conflict gave the Kuki and the Meitei armed groups a new lease on life, besides leading to the emergence of new Meitei militias. On the Kuki-Zo side, the groups bound by the ceasefire had begun from the initial stages to help civilians who had taken up arms. “Some of the \\[cadres\\] of the Suspension of Operations groups helped us set up the bunkers because they have experience,” said 35-year-old Mimin Sithlou, the joint secretary of the defence committee under the Committee on Tribal Unity, a conglomerate of civil society organisations functioning largely in Kangpokpi district, who oversaw the management of the bunkers there. The involvement of these cadres put the “VBIGs under pressure” to also join the conflict to fight on behalf of the Meitei community, the Assam Rifles document noted. VBIGs are valley-based insurgent groups, referring to the older Meitei-affiliated armed groups. They began “providing arms and ammunition”, consolidating their base and “increasing recruitment and ideological support”, the presentation said. As militias on either side of the divide began amping up recruitment and training of young people, particularly from rural areas, the conflict would sometimes ebb but then pick up again. The stalemate came into being. ## The stalemate In Haipi village, located about 15km (10 miles) from the trenches dug at the border of Kangpokpi district, Christmas passed without any celebrations for Janggoulun Kipgen’s family. I first met 19-year-old Kipgen in one of the bunkers in September. “We were trained for five to six days back in our village,” he told me, holding a rifle. On December 25, sitting inside her house in Haipi, Kipgen’s mother, Neinkhongah Kipgen, told me: “Who won’t fear to send their son to the front lines? We can only pray that he’s safe.” [![Janggoulun Kipgen on duty in September](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Janggoulun-Kipgen-on-duty-in-September-1712853563.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C578&quality=80)](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Janggoulun-Kipgen-on-duty-in-September-1712853563.jpg) Janggoulun Kipgen on duty in September near his village in Manipur \\[Angana Chakrabarti/Al Jazeera\\] Meitei civilians in villages like Singda Kadangband also face a similar dilemma. The nights seem endless, and the days are spent with unceasing uncertainty. “Except for the 60+-year-olds, everyone is expected to do 24-hour shifts,” a villager who didn’t wish to be named, told me back in September. “I have a one-year-old baby and work as a welder. I feel scared, but we don’t have much choice.” “This will have a long-lasting impact, particularly on the young and future generations. They have guns to defend their community, but that is not exactly how it will pan out. The person might use it to solve personal enmity. Then some unemployed people might start extortion. Then there can be cases of mistaken identity killing and then revenge killing. It is going to become a vicious cycle,” retired Lieutenant General Konsam Himalay Singh told me. What Lieutenant General Singh said had begun to play out by December when I last reported from Manipur. Videos of gun-toting men in the valley and the hills had proliferated on social media. The armed “volunteers” were being valorised on social media while in personal spaces, many spoke of the worries of young men being lured or recruited by militias, spawning a never-ending cycle of attack, revenge and turf war. This is despite more than 60,000 armed personnel of the federal government’s paramilitary forces, the army and the state police enforcing a buffer zone dividing a large part of the state into two ethnic territories that each community fears crossing. On April 19, Manipur will vote — along with several other parts of the country — even as the conflict rages on between the two communities. “The chief minister should have been thrown out. He is the head of state, and if he can’t be trusted, … the army and police should have gone on overdrive and taken control over the area, … but eventually, it was allowed to continue because when it simmers, your voting aggregate increases,” said the retired police officer familiar with the security and intelligence operations in the region. _The second part of this series looks at the role of the drug trade, politics and armed groups in keeping Manipur on a boil._ **Angana Chakrabarti is an associate member of The Reporters’ Collective.** **(With inputs from Harshitha Manwani, Mohan Rajagopal, Aryan Chaudhary and Vedant Kottapalle)** Source: Al Jazeera * * * aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo",

Varanasi, an ancient city of temples and gods, is [India’s](https://www.cnn.com/world/india) spiritual capital. And here, in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political stronghold, tensions between the two faiths are escalating. When [Modi](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/india/modi-profile-india-election-intl-hnk-dst/index.html) chose this holy city as his constituency a decade ago, it was the perfect setting for him to meld his party’s political and religious ambitions. Having risen to power on a promise of development and anti-corruption, his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now stands accused of turning India – a nation constitutionally bound to secularism – into a Hindu rashtra, or homeland. Hindu priests perform fire rituals on the banks of the Ganges in VaranasiJohn Mees/CNN As Sana Sabah celebrated the Muslim festival of Eid with her family in Varanasi, she raised these fears with trepidation in her voice. “It’s scary that someone like Modi … is not only celebrated but validated,” the 33-year-old entrepreneur said. The Hindu-nationalist right wing, she said, “is not even trying to hide it anymore. And it’s troublesome.” With [voting now underway](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/12/india/india-general-election-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html) in the world’s most populous nation, a significant portion of its more than 200 million strong Muslim population express fear at the prospect of Modi’s re-election.

John Mees/CNN Yet, 10 years after his ascension, many of Varanasi’s Muslims feel neglected, even betrayed, especially now as a centuries old-mosque becomes the latest flashpoint in a case that tests India’s secular fabric. Local Muslim leader Syed Mohammad Yaseen, 78, feels the government is failing to protect his community, which he says is feeling increasingly vulnerable and fearful of hate crimes in today’s India. “The worst will happen (if Modi gets reelected),” he said from his office in Varanasi. “We are tolerating these things, maybe one day there can be change. But we are hopeless.” Varanasi lies on the Ganges, the most sacred river in HinduismJohn Mees/CNN ## ‘We hide our names’ Modi’s BJP has its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates Hindu supremacy within India – though the party has repeatedly said it does not discriminate against minorities. “There is not one welfare scheme where religion, or community, is used as a base to discriminate,” said BJP Varanasi leader Dileep Patel, referring to the government’s welfare programs. “The prime minister’s schemes (programs) apply to our Muslim brothers, Hindu brothers, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, and Parsis, who have, without any discrimination, benefited from Modi.” There is no doubt that Modi’s decade in power has been transformative. India has arrived on the world stage, inching ever closer to global-power status, boasting the fastest-growing major economy, and making great strides in technology and space.

In 2019, Modi removed the special autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir – India’s only Muslim-majority state – bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. That same year, his administration passed a controversial citizenship law that excludes Muslim migrants, giving rise to deadly riots. Nasir Ali recalls the evening, weeks after the law’s enactment, when right-wing Hindu mobs gathered near his home in New Delhi, chanting anti-Islam slogans, attacking property and harassing residents. He was bringing his sister home from a hospital in a taxi. He felt safe, he said, because “this was the capital, Delhi, and it was daytime.” But as his taxi approached the streets, Ali saw the mob. “Among them, there was a man who took out his pistol and fired at me. He started chanting ‘Jai Shree Sri Ram’ (a Hindu religious slogan) and ran away,” says Ali. Nasir Ali claims he was shot because he is Muslim during an intense period of communal unrest in New Delhi in 2019. Vijay Bedi/CNN Ali says he believes he was shot because of his Muslim faith, and said it was a neighbor who pulled the trigger. He attempted to file a police complaint at his local station against the alleged perpetrators, a 2021 Delhi court order seen by CNN shows. But the police did not register his complaint, nor properly investigate, the court order said. The local Bhajanpura Police have since disputed those findings, and the case is winding its way through the legal system, with the next hearing expected in September, according to Ali’s lawyer. CNN has contacted Bhajanpura Police for comment. The riots were described as some of the worst sectarian violence in decades, leaving dozens, mostly Muslims, dead. Delhi police made about 800 arrests, according to a report shared by the [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Religion/Islamophobia-AntiMuslim/Civil%20Society%20or%20Individuals/RitumbraM2.pdf). Ali, who was blinded in one eye, now says he is wary of letting his fellow citizens know he is Muslim. “We do not let anyone realize (our religion),” he said. “We hide our names as well.” Moments of large-scale violence like those Delhi riots often make national or international headlines. But it is the day-to-day incidents which spring up all over India that many say characterizes the way life has changed for so many of India’s Muslims under Modi. Muslims look inside a charred mosque after it was set on fire by a mob during riots in the Mustafabad area of New Delhi on February 29, 2020. Muzamil Mattoo/NurPhoto/Getty Images/File When Usman, 28, moved from Kashmir to northwestern Rajasthan state for work in 2021, he said he struggled to find a home for weeks, visiting broker after broker in the city of Jaipur, who looked at his name and had one remark: “This is going to be a problem.” “It’s a given, a Muslim will face a struggle finding an apartment,” said Usman, who asked CNN to use only his first name, citing privacy concerns. “Things were bad before. Now, it’s become worse.” CNN has verified dozens of social media videos that paint a stark picture of religious divisions. In one from March this year, a policeman can be seen kicking Muslims offering prayers on the side of the road in New Delhi. In another from the western state of Gujarat last year, right-wing groups projected “Jai Shree Ram” on the walls of a mosque. In an incident that shocked the nation in August, a railway police officer opened fire on a moving train, killing three Muslim passengers and a Hindu constable, while allegedly advocating for Modi’s leadership. Anti-Muslim speech has also risen dramatically, a recent [report](https://indiahatelab.com/2024/02/25/hate-speech-events-in-india-2023-annual-report/) by the Washington-based research group India Hate Lab showed, which documented 668 such cases in 2023. Protesters gather to demand action against hate speech in New Delhi, December 2021. Manish Swarup/AP BJP politician T. Raja Singh openly called for violence against Muslims in an October speech in Rajasthan, proclaiming: “If they (Muslims) take one Hindu girl, we’ll take 10 of theirs.” At another event, he allegedly said: “You (Muslims) are half cut (circumcised), we will cut you fully.” India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section that criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs. Singh is facing a slew of police investigations, including for his alleged hate speeches, but in October last year he was fielded as a BJP candidate in state elections – winning his seat for the third time in a row. CNN has contacted Singh for a response.

Many Muslims fear this rise poses a danger to their communities – and worry it may only get worse as India votes in this election. Multiple human rights organizations, including [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2023/01/World_Report_2023_WEBSPREADS_0.pdf), [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/01/india-authorities-must-stop-their-discriminatory-policy-of-punitively-demolishing-muslim-properties/) and the [International Federation for Human Rights](https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/india/india-serious-concerns-raised-at-un-rights-review) have warned of continued discrimination against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, over the past decade, and have repeatedly called on authorities to end it. BJP National Spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill has said his party is not prejudiced against Muslims, and the community has benefited from Modi’s leadership. “India’s constitution protects the Indian democracy. No political party in country is strong enough to bulldoze the Constitution, to bulldoze the will of the people,” he said. Yet, critics have pointed to the lack of representation within the BJP. Despite being a party that claims to represent all Indians it [doesn’t have a single Muslim lawmaker](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/india/india-muslim-bjp-minister-resign-intl-hnk/index.html). This week, Modi himself sparked a row over hate speech while campaigning in Rajasthan, a BJP ruled-state, when he accused Muslims – who have been present in India for centuries – of being “infiltrators,” and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country’s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. The speech caused widespread anger among Muslims leaders and opposition politicians as well as calls for election authorities to investigate the comments. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants. ## Reclaiming mosques Shamsher Ali, a shopkeeper in Varanasi, fears for his two young daughters growing up in an increasingly polarized India. Ali looks back at his childhood – a time when, he says, Muslim-Hindu camaraderie was the norm. Muslims haven’t felt this level of fear in years, Ali says. Shamsher Ali worries for his young daughters, who he says are growing up in an increasingly polarized India. His arm was in a cast from a recent traffic accident. John Mees/CNN “So much hate has been sown that people now look at each other with suspicion … the tensions have become so bad that a Hindu and a Muslim can’t even see eye to eye,” the 45-year-old said. “This government is relying on driving a wedge between the two communities.” Meters from Ali’s shop, the Gyanvapi Mosque has become the latest battleground between Hindu nationalists and Varanasi’s Muslims. The mosque was built in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is widely believed a temple devoted to Lord Shiva on the same site was destroyed to make way for it. A different Hindu temple was subsequently built nearby in 1780 and for centuries, Hindus and Muslims prayed at their respective sites side by side, the temple’s gold stripes standing alongside the mosque’s white domes. The Kashi Vishwanath Temple stands next to the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi. Pictured here in December 12, 2021. Pawan Kumar/Reuters “Muslim women would wear their niqab (Muslim traditional dress) and Muslim men with their skullcaps would frequent the Ghats nearby (a holy Hindu area),” Ali recalled. But now, the Gyanvapi Mosque sits at the apex of a wider legal campaign to reclaim places of worship, and Hindu nationalists are demanding it back. Its fate is being debated across courtrooms in India, in a case that will have ramifications nationwide. In May 2022, a court survey claimed to find an artifact that resembled a Hindu relic inside the building. Muslims question the conclusion of the survey, saying it runs counter to their own findings. In January, a Varanasi court ruled that Hindus could offer prayer in the basement of the mosque. “Today, the police is against us. I don’t have faith in the judiciary,” said Yaseen, the local Muslim leader, from his office filled with documents related to the case. “They are giving judgment, but not justice.” Syed Mohammad Yaseen at his office in Varanasi. John Mees/CNN Outside the temple gates, guards patrol the area. Monkeys scale the walls of the complex, unconcerned by the high security and barbed-wire fence that fortifies the mosque. On the streets, vendors sell marigold flowers, and saffron flags fly high on shops and buildings. The incident has echoes of another major flashpoint – the 16th century Babri mosque in Ayodhya. It was demolished by Hindu hardliners in a 1992 attack, sparking deadly riots, in an incident that helped turbocharge the BJP from a fringe party to a major player. Earlier this year, Modi inaugurated a vast Hindu temple on the site, the culmination of a decades-long campaign and an event seen as a seminal moment by India’s leader – one, [critics sa](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/05/india/india-modi-ram-temple-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html) y, pulled the country away from its constitutionally secular foundations. “(Today) is the beginning of a new time cycle,” Modi said at the new temple. “After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived.” Guards patrol the street outside the Gyanvapi Mosque. John Mees/CNN Muslims return after offering prayer at the Gyanvapi Mosque. John Mees/CNN The Ghats on the banks of the Ganges river, in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. Lucas Vallecillos/VWPics/AP ## ‘Unique fabric threatened’ Dressed in a saffron robe with religious beads draped around his neck, Hindu priest Swami Jitendranand Saraswati doesn’t think fears harbored by Muslims are substantiated. “If they are saying they feel like they are second-class citizens, then this makes me happy,” he said with a smile, as worshippers touched his feet while bringing offerings to his small temple. He believes Gyanvapi is not a mosque, but a Hindu temple, and wants to see his community worship inside the walls of the building. Swami Saraswati also wants his community to reclaim some 3,000 more Hindu places of worship allegedly destroyed by Mughals centuries ago. “The Hindu community wants its lost self-respect back. The Hindu community wants its places of worship back,” he said. Hindu priest Swami Jitendranand Saraswati at his temple in Varanasi. John Mees/CNN Amit Pandey, the general secretary of the BJP’s youth wing in Varanasi, says India is a Hindu nation, and claims that all the country’s Muslims “were forcibly converted and made slaves by changing their religion” from Hinduism centuries ago. Mainstream historians paint a much more complicated picture, where the South Asian subcontinent experienced waves of migration, invasion, colonialism, trading, conversion and assimilation over the centuries that created the multifaith giant of today’s India. But not all Hindus are supporters of a Hindu nationalist narrative. Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, the priest of a prominent Hindu temple in Varanasi, believes Modi’s stoking of religious tensions is ruining the fabric of Indian society. Varanasi, he noted, is a spiritual center, home to all faiths. “All practices are allowed, and they help each other grow,” Mishra said, standing outside his temple near the banks of the Ganges. Vishwambhar Nath Mishra prays inside his temple in Varanasi. John Mees/CNN “Christianity, Muslims, Buddhism, Hinduism … they live here in a good harmony. And if we have any differences, we sit across the platform and we discuss the issues. This unique fabric has a strained condition now. We have a fear that this fabric may break.” The sentiment is echoed by Ali in his Varanasi shop, where he fears for his community’s survival. “Muslims have anyway become untouchables in this government,” he said. “People say leave the country, but we say we were born here. We will be buried in the soil of this land. This is my country.” **Read more from CNN’s India election coverage:** [**Billions spent, jungle-trekking poll workers and voting at 15,000 feet.

According to Zscaler’s “ThreatLabz 2025 Mobile, IoT, and OT Threat Report”, a staggering 26% of all mobile cyberattacks globally occur in India, making the country the top target worldwide. The report reveals that global mobile and spyware attacks have increased by 67% in just one year, while India alone saw a 38% year-on-year surge in mobile-based cybercrimes. Hackers are shifting their focus from traditional credit card scams to mobile payments and digital transactions, exploiting the rapid rise of cashless platforms. > [“Centre for Police Technology” Launched as Common Platform for Police, OEMs, and Vendors to Drive Smart Policing](https://the420.in/centre-for-police-technology-launched-as-common-platform-for-police-oems-and-vendors-to-drive-smart-policing/) ### Mobile Payments, Wallets, and Digital Transactions Under Attack Zscaler’s findings show that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting mobile devices to steal users’ banking credentials, card details, and personal data. The surge in digital wallet and UPI-based payments has created new avenues for exploitation. Fraudsters often disguise malicious programs as loan apps, investment platforms, or utility tools, tricking users into installing them. Once downloaded, these apps gain access to sensitive permissions — including camera, microphone, and file storage — allowing hackers full control of the device. ### Industrial Sectors Also Under Fire: Energy Most Affected The report notes that the threat is no longer limited to individual users. Critical industries such as energy, manufacturing, and transportation have witnessed an alarming rise in attacks. The energy sector alone experienced a 387% increase in cyber incidents compared to last year. Experts warn that such attacks pose serious risks to operational technology (OT) infrastructure, potentially disrupting essential services and industrial operations. ### Fake Apps Flood Google Play Store One of the most alarming findings is that over 200 malicious apps were identified on the Google Play Store, with a combined 42 million downloads. These apps often masquerade as productivity boosters, system cleaners, or security utilities — but in reality, they are designed to steal user data, install malware, or trigger ransomware attacks. Despite Google’s continuous monitoring and verification efforts, cybercriminals are finding new ways to list such apps on the platform, making it increasingly difficult for users to differentiate between genuine and fake applications. ### Expert View: Prof. Triveni Singh (Ex-IPS), Cybercrime Expert Renowned cybercrime expert and former IPS officer Professor Triveni Singh said the spike in mobile-related cybercrimes in India is a “direct outcome of rapid digital adoption combined with a lack of cyber awareness.” According to him, > “Almost every individual today owns a smartphone, but very few understand digital safety. Clicking on fake links or downloading fraudulent apps has become the new ‘digital trap’. Hackers no longer just steal money — they steal identities, data, and even manipulate victims psychologically. Until users practice cyber discipline, no technology can fully protect them.” Prof. Singh further noted that mobile-based fraud in India has now evolved into a form of organized crime. He emphasized that the response must go beyond technology — India needs a policy-level and awareness-driven approach. He also suggested launching a nationwide Mobile Cyber Hygiene Campaign in collaboration with the government and tech companies to educate citizens about safe digital practices and mobile security. ### The Road Ahead: Smartphone Security Must Be a National Priority With mobile penetration and digital payments accelerating at record speed, India’s rising share in global cyberattacks is a warning bell. The report makes it clear — the next battleground for cybersecurity is the smartphone itself. Both the government and private sector must strengthen system-level safeguards, while users must take responsibility for their own digital hygiene. The message for India is clear — digital convenience must go hand in hand with digital caution, because your smartphone is now your first line of defense.

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Ajit Doval’s Office Probes Digital Breach at Indira Gandhi Airport SHARE **NEW DELHI:** A suspected GPS spoofing attack that crippled flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport has prompted an investigation by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval’s office. The incident, which briefly grounded major domestic and international carriers, has reignited concerns about India’s aviation safety systems—already flagged by a recent parliamentary committee report as “lagging behind global standards.” Contents [A National Security Probe into the Heart of India’s Aviation System](https://the420.in/the420.in#a-national-security-probe-into-the-heart-of-indias-aviation-system) [Automation Under Stress: The AMSS Breakdown](https://the420.in/the420.in#automation-under-stress-the-amss-breakdown) [Warnings Ignored: A Parliamentary Report’s Stark Findings](https://the420.in/the420.in#warnings-ignored-a-parliamentary-reports-stark-findings) [Global Standards, Local Gaps](https://the420.in/the420.in#global-standards-local-gaps) ### **A National Security Probe into the Heart of India’s Aviation System** The Office of the National Security Advisor (NSA), led by Ajit Doval, has launched a high-level probe into a suspected GPS spoofing attack that disrupted flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport earlier this week. Officials confirmed that the anomaly, which crippled communication and navigation systems under the Airport Management Support System (AMSS), temporarily brought flight movements to a halt. The disruption, which lasted several hours, affected major domestic carriers such as IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air, alongside international airlines including British Airways and Lufthansa. While the issue was resolved within a day, it exposed a critical fault line in India’s aviation security infrastructure—an area increasingly vulnerable to both cyber and technical threats. > [“Centre for Police Technology” Launched as Common Platform for Police, OEMs, and Vendors to Drive Smart Policing](https://the420.in/centre-for-police-technology-launched-as-common-platform-for-police-oems-and-vendors-to-drive-smart-policing/) ### **Automation Under Stress: The AMSS Breakdown** Preliminary findings indicate that the malfunction stemmed from interference in the automated systems managing air traffic coordination and GPS tracking. The AMSS, a core backbone of modern airport operations, synchronizes navigation data, weather inputs, and flight management software. A disruption—whether caused by a cyberattack or a system overload—can cascade rapidly through radar, communication, and control networks. For passengers, the incident translated into chaos on the ground: delayed departures, missed connections, and a sudden breakdown in real-time flight data visibility. For aviation authorities, it underscored a deeper challenge—the growing strain on India’s automation systems as air traffic surges to pre-pandemic highs. ### **Warnings Ignored: A Parliamentary Report’s Stark Findings** The crisis came barely two months after a parliamentary committee issued a prescient warning about “performance degradation” in India’s aviation automation systems. The 380th report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture—tabled on August 20—had flagged slowness, lag, and system inefficiencies at major airports, including Delhi and Mumbai. The committee cautioned that these technical limitations, coupled with outdated air traffic control (ATC) infrastructure, could jeopardize flight safety. It further highlighted chronic staff shortages, rising controller fatigue, and the slow pace of modernization—factors that have collectively pushed India’s aviation systems behind global benchmarks. ### **Global Standards, Local Gaps** India’s aviation sector, one of the fastest-growing in the world, has struggled to align its safety architecture with international standards. While the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has accelerated modernization programs under its Air Navigation Services Roadmap, experts warn that digital vulnerabilities—especially cyber interference like GPS spoofing—represent a new frontier of risk. The Delhi incident, now under the NSA’s scrutiny, marks a critical juncture. It is no longer only about technical resilience but also about national security preparedness in a digital era where the skies are as much about networks as they are about airways.

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two...",

China and India have accused each other of firing shots during a Sept. 7 incident south of Pangong Lake, marking the first official claims of small arms fire on the border since 1975. While the situation in Ladakh had calmed down after the deadly June 15 melee in Galwan Valley, a resurgence of tensions is now occurring in a separate area of the disputed territory. Since Aug. 29, Chinese forces have allegedly been trying to cross into Indian controlled territory in the mountainous area between Pangong and Spanggur Lakes. India reportedly deployed troops to block these Chinese incursion attempts in several separate incidents. ...

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Four of the sites were reportedly located in Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, with the remaining five located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Local media reports claim India's military used air assets to deploy standoff weapons, including SCALP/Storm Shadow cruise missiles and AASM HAMMER smart missiles, as well as loitering munitions to target alleged militant infrastructure.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://frontline.thehindu.com?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ## Stories that help you connect the dots ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

India will have its work cut out for it as it fights off China's encroachment in South Asia. (SANJEEV VERMA/Hindustan Times via Getty Images) ## Highlights - _China's Belt and Road Initiative will compel India to deepen its engagement with its neighbors under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"Neighborhood First\" policy, as peripheral nations in South Asia seek to maximize their benefits from the competition between Beijing and New Delhi._ - _Because India wishes to maintain its regional influence to guarantee national security, it will prioritize investment and diplomatic overtures to countries like the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh._ - _But as India seeks to cultivate its influence on the periphery, it will find it difficult to compete with China and its Belt and Road Initiative given Beijing's superior access to capital through state-owned enterprises._ Since winning a landslide reelection in May, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has taken major strides toward advancing his country's grand strategy. Most prominently, Modi revoked Jammu and Kashmir's autonomous status on Aug. 5 to strengthen the country's territorial unity, much to the consternation of archrival Pakistan. And against the backdrop of that momentous decision, Modi's government is pursuing another element of its grand strategy as well: preserving its sphere of influence. With that in mind, New Delhi has recently beaten a path to the door of the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh. But with China more than prepared to open the checkbook to dazzle the region with infrastructure projects as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, India knows it can ill-afford to neglect its backyard, meaning Modi's \"Neighborhood First\" policy will be front and center as he begins his second term in office....

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

These include political rallies, electoral campaign events, religious processions, protest marches, demonstrations, and cultural or nationalist gatherings. In other instances, they are organized with the express objective of harassing minorities. In 2024, the Indian general election, state elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, and hate rallies triggered by exaggerated claims of violence against Hindus in Bangladesh served as key catalysts for a significant proportion of hate speech incidents. Hate speech in India in 2024 followed an alarming trajectory, deeply intertwined with the ideological ambitions of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the broader Hindu nationalist movement. The number of hate speech incidents targeting religious minorities surged from 668 in 2023 to 1,165 in 2024, marking a staggering 74.4% increase. Dangerous speech—defined as speech that \"increases the risk that its audience will condone or participate in violence against members of another group\"—also saw a significant rise. Patterns of hate speech in 2024 reflect both continuity and transformation in its context and content with longstanding Hindu nationalist tropes remaining dominant—such as the portrayal of Muslims and Christians as “outsiders” in Hindu India and Muslims as a threat to Hindus. Hate speeches frequently invoked the narrative of Muslims as \"infiltrators,\" linked to thinly veiled allegations of all Indian Muslims as Bangladeshi migrants or Rohingya refugees. Hindu far-right leaders demonized Indian Muslims as parasitic and thieving, alleging that they were either wrongfully granted resources that rightfully belonged to Hindus or were stealing Hindu wealth through acts of aggression. These rhetorical shifts reinforced exclusionary narratives, further escalating anti-minority sentiment and hostility. Social media platforms—Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter)—have been key instruments in enabling, amplifying, and mainstreaming hate speech and extremist ideologies, both in India and globally. In the Indian context, these platforms have been extensively utilized to articulate and spread Hindu nationalist ideology and anti-minority rhetoric. Of the 1,165 in-person hate speech events targeting Muslim and Christian minorities in 2024, 995 videos were traced back to their original sources on social media, where they were first uploaded or live streamed. Given the logic of virality, social media platforms facilitate the rapid and widespread circulation of hateful content while also elevating the most extreme instances of hate speech through algorithmic amplification. Despite their own community standards prohibiting hate speech, social media platforms failed to enforce their guidelines, allowing violative content to spread unchecked. Viewed cumulatively, shifts in hate speech patterns in 2024 reinforced and amplified the core tenets of the Hindu nationalist worldview, that is, the idea of India as an exclusively Hindu nation with minorities, especially Muslims and Christians, as perpetual outsiders. The sharp spike in the rise of hate speech events points to the incorporation of hate speech as part of routine electoral politics and campaign strategy. It is also indicative of an increasingly aggressive assertion of Hindu nationalism in public and political life. As of 2024, Hindu nationalism has taken on a much more extreme form, with its rhetoric becoming more blatant, inflammatory, and violent. Marking a continuity with past trends, hate speech in 2024 contributed to an environment where increasingly egregious expressions of hate and violence against Indian minorities continued to be normalized. **Keywords:** India, Hate Speech, Hindu nationalism, India Hate Lab, Center for the Study of Organized Hate, Narendra Modi, T Raja Singh, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Indian Muslims, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party, Nitesh Rane **Suggested Citation:** [Suggested Citation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5130832) Lab, India Hate, **Report 2024: Hate Speech Events in India** (February 10, 2025).

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

The country’s electricity grid, which has long been associated with outages, inefficiency, and high losses, is evolving into a digitally empowered network in which real-time data, sensors, and automation drive supply, demand, and distribution. However, as this change accelerates, the essential question is no longer whether India can develop a smart grid, but how and who controls it, particularly as technology replaces current institutional structures. The National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and the Ministry of Power intend to transform India’s electrical system into a “secure, adaptive, sustainable, and digitally enabled ecosystem” via stakeholder perception. India has deployed over 40 million smart meters by mid-2025, indicating progress in the development of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). However, despite lofty goals and hardware deployment, obstacles remain. FSR Global’s March 2025 research identified a fundamental problem in developing an interoperable smart grid ecosystem, including limitations in standards, insufficient data governance, vendor fragmentation, and cyber-security concerns. Smart grids usher in a fundamentally new form of “governance”—one mediated by algorithms. AI-powered systems predict loads, reroute supply, detect defects, and (in some situations) determine dynamic tariffs. Cities like Delhi are the first to use these kinds of technologies, and state utilities are working with companies from around the world to use advanced analytics. For example, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (MSEDCL) made a deal with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to improve its system with AI, machine learning, and battery energy storage devices. But this choice makes it hard to tell who is at fault. If an algorithm sends out goods incorrectly, places businesses ahead of families, or charges a peak surcharge, who is to blame? The rules and laws haven’t been updated to align with how technology operates in the real world. If algorithmic decisions aren’t clear, operations might not be clear either. In the smart grid, data is as important as copper lines. Smart meters collect specific consumption patterns down to the appliance level; an analytics tool interprets the data and utilises it to improve network performance. But this makes people worry about privacy, security, and fairness. A recent poll by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) found that consumers are worried about billing accuracy, connectivity issues, and data privacy, which are all making it harder to roll out smart meters. Regulatory frameworks also fall behind. While the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2022, includes significant structural reforms, it does not address data ownership rights, algorithmic transparency, or consumer redress. Unless these loopholes are bridged, smart grids may recreate existing hierarchies in a new digital format. India is switching to smart grids for a number of reasons, but one of the most important is to deal with the growing amount of renewable energy, largely solar and wind, that is being used more and more at the distribution level. Smart systems help balance energy generation that happens at different times, control battery storage, and make prosumer (consumer-plus-producer) possible. The government also recently extended the interstate transmission system (ISTS) charge waiver for battery energy storage projects until June 2028. This is a big incentive for stabilising grids with a lot of renewable energy. However, as one _FT_ analysis on the “solar village” project in Gujarat highlighted, storage capacity remains a bottleneck: India needs 336 GWh by 2030, but predictions for 2026-27 are just 82 GWh. Not every state is moving at the same rate. In Karnataka, the implementation of smart meters under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) has suffered delays. A state official recently stated that even with subsidies, costs will not drop below Rs 1,000 per meter in Bengaluru. The state is still reviewing whether to opt in. In another example, India’s transmission authority recently withdrew grid access for approximately 17 GW of delayed clean-energy projects in states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in order to prioritise projects that are ready for implementation. For areas experiencing energy poverty, the transition to smart grids is about more than just efficiency; it’s about justice. The promise of increased reliability, lower losses, and lower tariffs exists, but only if the transformation is equitable. The key dimensions of justice include distributive, procedural, and recognitional. These measures demonstrate that, even as smart grid technology advances, execution limits. If smart grid governance remains opaque, the risk is a two-tier energy system: a “well-connected algorithmic” grid for some and a weak heritage grid for others. To make smart grids work for India, not just utilities, policy must keep up with technology. Algorithmic accountability frameworks require openness, auditability, and human monitoring in grid-decision systems. Data governance regime aims to figure out who owns data about how consumers use electricity, how it can be used and shared, and how to get consent. In systemic cyber resilience, it is needed to ensure that even smaller DISCOMs establish Cyber Security Operations Centers (CSOCs) and undertake regular audits. Equitable rollout options include prioritising states with high energy poverty for meter improvements, analytics tools, and demand-response programs. Secondly, interoperability standards accelerate the integration of grid protocols, vendor systems, and communication networks to prevent smart systems from becoming proprietary silos. Power plants and transmission lines will no longer define India’s energy future; instead, algorithms will play an increasingly important role. But the real test is how those algorithms are run: do they help people or systems? Do they help make things fairer or make things worse? Smart grids provide the basis for the transformation that India needs to make in order to reach its goal of 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. The grid might be getting smarter, but the people in charge need to be too. India’s move to smart grids is more than just a technological leap; it also means a change in how the energy business is run, how people are held accountable, and how justice is served. As computers take over more and more of the control of electricity flows, the decision of who gets energy, when, and for how much money moves from people to machines. This move, although promising to make things more efficient and reliable, also shows some big hazards, such as breaches of data privacy, unequal access, and slow government action. As India moves from physical to digital infrastructure, it needs to make sure that the intelligence that runs its grids is fair, accessible, and overseen by the people. _Anusreeta Dutta is a columnist and climate researcher with prior experience as a political researcher and ESG analyst._ _Aakash Bajpai is Student, Indian Institute of Forest Management._ _Views expressed are the author’s own and don’t necessarily reflect those of_ Down To Earth [power](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/power) [Privacy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/privacy) [security](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/security) [algorithms](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/algorithms) [fairness](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/fairness) Show Comments Down To Earth www.downtoearth.org.in INSTALL APP",

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

Surrounding the golden fortress city of Jaisalmer in India’s Thar desert, a sea of wind turbines stretches out across the arid landscape as far as the eye can see — visibly marking the world’s third-largest carbon emitter’s green power expansion. Engineers at a 30MW wind farm here operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest clean energy developers, speak with pride about contributing to a national renewable capacity goal of 500GW by 2030. Yet not all of the country’s green power can be dispatched, with the energy grid emerging as a choking constraint. Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew, is confident India will “definitely” achieve its renewable capacity target. “I can see that we’ll get to 500GW, but we won’t be able to exceed it because there’s not enough transmission.” While India boasts one of the world’s largest transmission networks, spanning more than 494,000 circuit kilometres, the grid has not kept pace with the surge in renewable projects. More than 50GW of capacity is stranded, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a US-based think-tank, and JMK Research & Analytics, an Indian cleantech research and consulting firm. © Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images “Transmission has become a critical bottleneck . . . causing rising curtailment and commissioning delays in resource-rich states,” says Jyoti Gulia, founder and chief executive of JMK. Earlier this year, Pralhad Joshi, India’s minister for new and renewable energy, hailed a “Historic Green Leap” after the country reached 50 per cent of its [power capacity from renewables](https://www.ft.com/content/a99a5845-9f50-49a3-8c7c-d704b2cf3b95), now totalling 243GW. Even so, Gulia says, grid expansion delays would “lock in higher coal generation”. Nearly three-quarters of India’s power currently comes from coal, which remains central to meeting its growing electricity demand. This is partly due to fragmented planning between state and central authorities, which largely run India’s grid, as well as mismatched build cycles. Renewable projects can be completed in 12 to 18 months, while transmission lines typically take three to five years. Clean power is also predominantly produced in three states: Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while high demand regions such as Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have little capacity, making cross state delivery critical. “To perfect the timing is impossible,” Ashish Khanna, chief executive of Adani Green Energy — the country’s largest renewable power company — said in September at the Financial Times’ Energy Transition Summit in New Delhi. “You can’t first wait for a grid to come and then build a renewable project.” Those constraints have become the most visible in the northwestern wind and sun-rich state of Rajasthan and development heavy areas there such as Jaisalmer. IEEFA and JMK estimate that 8GW of clean power capacity in the state currently cannot be transmitted. One renewable industry executive in Rajasthan says the “spurt” of green projects, paired with slow grid growth, will probably slow further capacity build out for at least a couple of years. Developers also face obstacles from environmental blockages and grinding [difficulties acquiring contiguous land](https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e) in a country with hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers. In parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat, a years-long legal ban has prevented new overhead transmission lines from being laid across more than 100,000 sq km to protect the Great Indian Bustard, a [highly endangered and poor-sighted bird](https://www.ft.com/content/cec843fe-804a-43a4-b89a-4f7970c3a6a4) known to fly into power cables. In key areas, smaller players have also exploited those time lags, pre-booking chunks of transmission capacity with no intention of building power plants — driving up premiums to secure connectivity, which they then sell to developers. This delays projects and further burdens genuine operators. Gulia says the bureaucratic need for multi-agency clearances and right-of-way permits that are frequently initiated post-award cause “months to years of delay”. Ideally there should be a single-window regulatory clearance system with strict timelines, she says, as well as performance-based incentives and disincentives. Last year India announced a plan to bolster the power grid and deploy the vast amounts of renewable energy coming online. The expansion is expected to cost Rs9.15tr ($104bn) to allow the transmission of 600GW of green power capacity by 2032. However, India’s Central Electricity Authority agency has acknowledged that public funding will not be sufficient to cover the build-out, which means the private sector is likely to have to step in. Private investment from the likes of Adani and Tata Power is already starting to reshape the sector, Khanna at Adani Green says. About 9 per cent of the grid is operated by corporates. “They are going to bring their own efficiencies to the system,” adds Khanna, “so I am hopeful that in times to come we will have less \\[of a\\] gap.” ### Europe’s Climate Leaders _The FT is compiling its sixth annual list of Europe’s climate leaders.

The situation threatens the nation's clean energy goals. Renewable Powered by - [Bloomberg](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675367/Bloomberg) - Published On Nov 10, 2025 at 03:37 PM IST - - Copy Link - Share on WhatsApp - Share on Linkedin - Share on X - Share on Telegram - Share on Facebook Indias power grid faces significant challenges absorbing a surge in solar installations, leading to record curtailment rates.India’s power grid is struggling to absorb a surge in solar power installations, leading to more curtailment that threatens the build-out of renewables and underscores the need for energy storage.The curtailment rate for solar generation in October rose to about 12 per cent, the highest since May when [Grid Controller of India Ltd.](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/grid+controller+of+india+ltd.) started publishing the data. On some days, about 40 per cent of solar power output was denied access to the national network. Curtailments measure how much electricity was generated without finding its way to customers. Advt The data points to a deepening mismatch between supply and demand when solar generation floods the grid during the day time. Coal power plants can’t reduce output fast enough to make room for surging solar output, and the fossil fuel must be kept in operation as it’s needed to meet demand after the sun sets.The month also saw rare curtailments of wind power, the data showed. This highlights the need to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources with storage, like grid-scale batteries, so that excess electricity can be dispatched in the evening.India has about 44-gigawatts worth of green projects that are struggling to find state utilities to buy their electricity. The government is considering canceling projects where prospects of an offtake deal looks minimal, threatening a goal of doubling clean power capacity to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade. - [Bloomberg](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675367/Bloomberg) - Published On Nov 10, 2025 at 03:37 PM IST - - Telegram - Facebook - Copy Link ## Comments What are your thoughts?

Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

    "full_text": "With Washington launching its protectionist trade offensive, New Delhi faces a pivotal test in balancing national interests and global market access. **Impact of US tariffs**: The much-dreaded Liberation Day, Washington’s euphemism for a sweeping wave of tariffs, finally arrived on April 2. As anticipated, India found itself on the receiving end, with a 26% tariff slapped on its exports to the United States. The move has raised serious concerns about the future of trade ties between New Delhi and its largest export destination. In a dramatic shift from traditional diplomacy, President Donald Trump announced that the US would impose tariffs equal to half of what other countries charge on American goods. Since India levies a cumulative 52% tariff on US products, the new White House annexure listed a reciprocal 27% tariff on Indian goods. But this is only the beginning. According to a White House fact sheet, a 10% base tariff on all imports will take effect from April 5. From April 9, countries running the highest trade deficits with the US — including India — will face even steeper levies. A total of 185 countries are expected to be impacted. With these moves, the average US tariff rate has now surged to 29% — its highest level in over a century. **READ \\| [Ayushman Bharat: A grand promise undone by poor execution](https://www.policycircle.org/society/ayushman-bharat-scheme-pmjay/)** ### **Blow to India’s export ambitions** The fallout for India is likely to be significant. The US is one of the few major economies with which India enjoys a trade surplus — $46 billion as of 2024. However, these gains now stand threatened. India had already been in Washington’s crosshairs, featuring in Trump’s infamous Dirty 15 list — countries deemed the worst offenders in terms of trade practices. The sectors expected to be hit hardest include agriculture, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and precious stones. #### Trump effect: Additional US tariffs on India Compiled by Murali Kallummal, Professor, Centre for WTO Studies, IIFT According to a recent study by the Global Trade Research Initiative ( [GTRI](https://gtri.co.in/)), the most affected agricultural segments will be fish, meat, and processed seafood — which together accounted for $2.58 billion in exports to the US last year. Notably, America absorbs 40% of India’s total shrimp exports. Higher tariffs will erode competitiveness and shrink market share. India’s gains in electronics could also unravel. The Indian government had worked to position the country as a viable alternative to China under the China+1 strategy, especially in smartphone manufacturing. Finished smartphones currently attract a 16-20% import duty in India, while Indian exports to the US enjoy zero duty. But if US tariffs now apply to Indian phones, the fledgling sector may suffer a blow in its early growth phase, potentially reversing hard-won progress. One silver lining, however, is that India’s IT services — which form a large chunk of exports — are exempt from goods-specific tariffs, at least for now. ### **Navigating a rising trade storm** The pressing question for India’s policymakers is: how to counter mounting trade pressure from Washington without derailing its export-led growth strategy? A crucial step would be to fast-track the ongoing negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US. Talks have been in motion, and both sides have incentives to reach an accord quickly. A successful BTA could offer exemptions or relief from some of the punitive measures. India has already taken pre-emptive steps. In March, New Delhi signed the terms of reference for a BTA following a push from the Prime Minister’s Office. It also lowered duties on select American products — including high-end motorcycles, agricultural goods, and Bourbon whiskey — in its Union Budget, signalling a willingness to negotiate. Still, New Delhi must tread carefully. While India’s tariff levels may appear high, they reflect domestic development goals and the need to protect vulnerable industries. The US prioritises its commercial interests. India too must evaluate each demand against its own national priorities — development, industrialisation, and cultural values. A recent PwC report recommended that Indian businesses build long-term resilience strategies — including diversification of markets and value chain upgrades — to mitigate the impact of US protectionism. ### **Strategic realignments** Amid this backdrop, an intriguing diplomatic overture emerged. On April 2 — coinciding with the US tariff announcement — China and India marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a message to Indian President Droupadi Murmu, called for a “dragon-elephant tango” to strengthen cooperation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed the sentiment, noting that stronger India-China ties would support a stable, multipolar world. Observers see this as a subtle signal to Washington: major developing economies are willing to explore alternative alliances if pushed too hard. Xi emphasised the need for mutual modernisation between China and India as leading voices of the Global South — perhaps suggesting a pivot away from overreliance on Western markets. ### **The road ahead** The 26% reciprocal tariff may compel India to re-examine its own tariff structures, not just in response to the US, but to remain competitive in global markets. The coming weeks will be critical as New Delhi awaits a formal list of US demands and considers its options. India remains an essential market for US companies across sectors — from tech to pharmaceuticals — and this mutual interdependence offers room for compromise. India’s strategy should be to engage the US in negotiations rather than escalate into a full-blown trade war. As noted in a Bernstein report, India’s measured, diplomatic approach could help it navigate the turbulent waters of trade protectionism, preserving both economic stability and strategic autonomy.

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?
