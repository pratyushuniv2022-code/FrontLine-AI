International Energy Agency Website: www.iea.org Foreword 3 Foreword This latest edition of the International Energy Agency (IEA) flagship publication, the World Energy Outlook (WEO), comes at a time when energy is increasingly at the centre of political and geopolitical tensions. Of course, the links between energy and politics have always been close, but when we look at the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once. Governments are contending with a formidable array of potential threats, vulnerabilities, dependencies and uncertainties spanning areas such as oil, natural gas, electricity, energy infrastructure, critical minerals, technology supply chains, data centres and AI, and more. Energy security today is truly a matter of economic and national security – and safeguarding it requires the same spirit of cooperation and focus that governments showed when the IEA was created after the 1973 oil shock. Take, for example, critical minerals, which are a major theme of this WEO but also reflect the broader role of the IEA on issues of energy security, where we move quickly to identify and address emerging vulnerabilities. The IEA was the first to highlight the risks of high concentration of critical mineral supplies, especially in refining and processing. Today, a single country is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 energy-related strategic minerals. As we pointed out in our landmark report on the subject in 2021, reliance on a small number of suppliers raises the risks of supply disruptions or economic coercion. Over the past few years, the IEA has invested heavily in building up our global data and analytical capabilities in critical minerals, mirroring the world-leading capacities that we have across other parts of the energy sector, and setting up a Critical Minerals Security Programme. The topic was also a major focus at our Summit on the Future of Energy Security, held in London partnership with the UK government in April 2025. Today, the risks that we identified in 2021 are no longer a theoretical concern; they have become a hard reality. The implications spread across different energy technologies but also apply to other strategic sectors such as energy, automotive, AI and defence. They affect millions of jobs. As we highlight again in this Outlook, urgent action is needed both in the near term to strengthen preparedness against potential disruptions, and over the longer term to diversify supply chains and reduce structural risks. All of this shows how the IEA’s analysis transfers across into real-world impact. There are many other aspects of this Outlook that also have real operational implications for energy policymakers. The focus on electricity security; the countries like India, Indonesia and Brazil that are increasingly shaping energy market trends; the sea change in gas markets that is on the horizon with the new wave of liquefied natural gas (LNG), led by the United States. We also highlight, once again, two critical areas where the world is clearly falling short: universal energy access and climate change. Both of these have been longstanding focus areas for the IEA and the WEO for decades. We present a new pathway in this year’s WEO IEA.

This builds on the momentum created by the landmark Summit on Clean Cooking Africa that the IEA and our partners organised in Paris in May 2024. And we highlight once again that, far from limiting global warming to 1.5 °C or well below 2 °C, we are currently heading towards outcomes in the range of 2.5-3 °C, with severe implications for lives and livelihoods around the world. There are still pathways that mitigate these risks significantly, while the options to reduce emissions substantially are well understood and, in many cases, cost effective. I would like to warmly thank the team of IEA colleagues who worked extremely hard on this new WEO under the outstanding leadership of my colleagues Laura Cozzi and Tim Gould. More than ever, the world needs clear data and analysis to help navigate a complex and dangerous world. The WEO has always fulfilled that vital role and I am very glad and proud that it remains in that role today. Dr Fatih Birol Executive Director International Energy Agency IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Executive Summary 17 Executive Summary In a volatile world, energy security takes centre stage Pressing threats and longer term hazards are elevating energy to a core issue of economic and national security. Energy is at the heart of today’s geopolitical tensions, with traditional risks to fuel supply now accompanied by restrictions affecting supplies of critical minerals. The electricity sector – so essential to modern economies – is also increasingly vulnerable to cyber, operational and weather-related hazards. Decisions taken by energy policy makers will be crucial to address these risks, but they do so against a complex backdrop:  Geopolitical fragility coexists with subdued oil prices. Ongoing conflicts and instability sit alongside oil market balances showing a large surplus of supply over demand.  Countries are prioritising energy security and affordability but are reaching for different levers to achieve them. Some, including many fuel-importing countries, lean towards renewables and efficiency as solutions. Others focus more on ensuring ample supplies of traditional fuels.  There are fractures in the international system and uncertainties over the outlook for trade, but energy trade is more important than ever. Abundant supplies of oil, solar panels, batteries and, before long, liquefied natural gas (LNG) create strong incentives for producers to seek out international markets.  There is less momentum than before behind national and international efforts to reduce emissions, yet climate risks are rising. 2024 was the hottest year on record and the first in which global temperatures exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C) above pre\u0002industrial levels. At the same time, the world remains thirsty for energy. New technologies are entering the system at speed, and renewables set new records for deployment in 2024 for the 23rd consecutive year. Oil, natural gas and coal consumption, and nuclear output, all reached record highs as well. Driven mainly by China, since 2019 demand for coal has grown 50% faster than the next fastest growing fossil fuel, natural gas, a key reason why energy-related emissions have continued to grow. There is no single storyline about the future of energy, which is why the World Energy Outlook presents multiple scenarios, none of which is a forecast. The framework presented in this Outlook is based on the latest and most comprehensive data on policies, technologies and markets, together with rigorous modelling. This allows readers to explore the implications of different choices and pathways. Scenarios The World Energy Outlook 2025 (WEO-2025) has three main scenarios. Two of these set starting conditions and then examine where they lead – the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) and the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). A third, the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario, maps out a pathway to achieve specific energy and climate-related goals.  The Current Policies Scenario considers a snapshot of policies and regulations that are already in place and offers a cautious perspective on the speed at which new energy technologies are deployed and integrated into the energy system. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 18 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025  The Stated Policies Scenario considers the application of a broader range of policies, including those that have been formally put forward but not yet adopted, as well as other official strategy documents that indicate the direction of travel. Barriers to the introduction of new technologies are lower than in the CPS, but the STEPS does not assume that aspirational targets are met.  The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario takes a different approach, describing a pathway to reduce global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net zero by 2050, while recognising that each country will have its own route. An additional normative scenario, the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS), provides a new roadmap to achieve universal access to electricity and clean cooking – crucial development goals that the IEA has actively supported for more than two decades. The WEO-2025 does not include the Announced Pledges Scenario, which models a future for the energy system in which key national energy and climate targets, such as countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs), are achieved in full and on time. Our assessment of the new round of NDCs that were due this year, generally covering the period to 2035, will follow once there is a more complete picture of these commitments. What do the WEO scenarios allow us to assert with confidence about the future? Our scenarios cover a wide range of trajectories, highlighting different opportunities and vulnerabilities, but there are common elements. Most fundamentally, as economies expand and populations and incomes grow, each scenario sees the world’s need for energy services increase with demand rising for mobility; for heating, cooling, lighting and other household and industrial uses; and increasingly for data and artificial intelligence (AI)-related services. Beyond this, four other commonalities stand out: the changing nature of energy security, with the supply of critical minerals as an acute vulnerability; the arrival of the Age of Electricity; a shift in the centre of gravity of the energy system towards India and other emerging economies beyond China; and a rising role for renewables, accompanied by the comeback of nuclear energy. Serious threats are hanging over critical minerals supply chains Traditional hazards affecting the security of oil and gas supply are now accompanied by vulnerabilities in other areas, most visibly in critical minerals supply chains. These new dimensions to energy security have been a consistent focus for the International Energy Agency. They were central to our Summit on the Future of Energy Security in London in 2025 and have been underscored by China’s new export controls on rare earth elements and battery components and technologies. The key risk for critical minerals is high levels of market concentration. A single country is the dominant refiner for 19 out of 20 energy\u0002related strategic minerals, with an average market share of around 70%. The minerals in question are vital for power grids, batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), but they also play a crucial role in AI chips, jet engines, defence systems and other strategic industries. As of November 2025, more than half of these strategic minerals are subject to some form of export controls. Fostering more diverse and resilient supply chains for critical minerals will take a concerted policy effort; market forces alone will not deliver. Since 2020, most of the growth in refined IEA. CC BY 4.0. Executive Summary 19 production of key energy minerals came from the leading suppliers. As a result, geographic concentration in refining increased for nearly all key energy minerals, and particularly for nickel and cobalt. Our analysis of announced projects suggests that reversing this process is set to be slow. In the CPS, supply concentration would be likely to remain higher than in the STEPS, as weaker minerals demand translates into lower prices that favour incumbent producers with lower costs. Determined action is required today to enhance preparedness against potential disruptions, and over the longer term to build up new partnerships and projects that diversify supply chains more quickly. Resilience is key in a world of growing security risks There is also an urgent need to build greater resilience to rising weather-related risks, cyberattacks and other malicious activity targeting critical infrastructure. A new IEA dataset shows that recent annual operational disruptions to critical energy infrastructure affected energy supplies to more than 200 million households around the world. Droughts constrain output from hydropower and some thermal generators, while storms, floods and wildfires force shutdowns and damage different types of energy facilities, from solar plants to offshore oil and gas facilities. Power lines are particularly vulnerable: transmission and distribution grids were affected in about 85% of incidents. Weather-related risks are set to rise across our scenarios, which all exceed 1.5 °C warming on a regular basis by around 2030, diverging only after 2035. The Age of Electricity is here Electricity is at the heart of modern economies and electricity demand grows much faster than overall energy use in all scenarios. It rises by around 40% to 2035 in both the CPS and the STEPS, and by more than 50% in the NZE Scenario. Demand growth comes in varying proportions from appliances and air conditioners, advanced manufacturing and other light industries, electric mobility, data centres and electrified heating. Investors are reacting to this trend: spending on electricity supply and end-use electrification already accounts for half of today’s global energy investment. Rising electricity use means that electricity prices are becoming a key reference point for consumers and policy makers. For the moment, electricity accounts for only 21% of total final consumption globally, but it is the key source of energy for sectors accounting for over 40% of the global economy and the main source of energy for most households. This underscores the importance of secure and affordable electricity supply, and the economic and social costs of blackouts such as those seen in 2025 in Chile and the Iberian Peninsula. A pivotal issue for electricity security in the Age of Electricity is the speed at which new grids, storage and other sources of power system flexibility are put in place. For the moment, some of these elements are lagging. Investments in electricity generation have charged ahead by almost 70% since 2015 to reach USD 1 trillion per year, but annual grid spending has risen at less than half the pace to USD 400 billion. This increases congestion, delays the connection of new sources of electricity generation and demand, and pushes up electricity prices. Curtailment of wind and solar output is on the rise, as are incidences of negative pricing in wholesale markets, but slow permitting is holding back grid projects, as are tight markets for transformers and other components. Risks have been mitigated in part IEA. CC BY 4.0. 20 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 by the rise of battery storage, where annual additions rose to more than 75 gigawatts (GW) in 2024, but batteries cannot provide all the answers – especially where seasonal flexibility needs rise alongside short-term ones. Rising incomes and temperatures underpin a surge in electricity use for air conditioning. Cooling is a rising source of electricity demand in all scenarios, led by emerging and developing economies, with important potential impacts on peak electricity demand. In the STEPS, for example, income-driven air conditioning use adds around 330 GW to global peak demand by 2035, and higher temperatures add another 170 GW. The efficiency of new air conditioners is a critical factor for managing future strains on power systems. In all markets, there are already much more efficient air conditioners available on the shelves, at no or modest additional cost, than the average models being bought today. Explosive growth in electricity demand for data centres and AI is concentrated in advanced economies and China. Investment in data centres is expected to reach USD 580 billion in 2025. Those who say that “data is the new oil” will note that this surpasses the USD 540 billion being spent on global oil supply. A tripling of the amount of electricity consumed by data centres by 2035 represents less than 10% of total global electricity demand growth, but it is highly concentrated geographically. More than 85% of new data centre capacity additions over the next ten years are expected in the United States, China and the European Union – and many are located near existing data centre clusters, putting additional strain on congested grids. New players set the trends as demand for energy services continues to rise Energy market dynamics are increasingly shaped by a group of emerging economies, led by India and Southeast Asia and joined by countries in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Collectively, they take up the baton from China – which accounted for more than half of global oil and gas demand growth and 60% of electricity demand growth since 2010 – although no country comes close to replicating China’s energy trajectory on its own. This shift in the centre of gravity of the energy system is reflected in multiple indicators. For example, between 2000 and 2010, advanced economies accounted for half of the growth in the global car fleet; in the decade that followed, China alone did the same. Between today and 2035, half of the growth in the global car fleet comes from emerging and developing economies outside China. Mapping the new geography of demand onto the distribution of global energy resources reveals that, by 2035, 80% of energy consumption growth occurs in regions with high\u0002quality solar irradiation. This is a sharp contrast with the past decade when medium- to low\u0002solar regions drove half of the growth. This helps explain the swift uptake of solar technologies in our scenarios, as well as the rise in demand for cooling. Many of the new demand centres in Asia have some domestic coal resources and rely on imported oil and gas. The continued rise of renewable energy The pace varies, but renewables grow faster than any other major energy source in all scenarios, led by solar photovoltaics (PV). In the CPS, where they face stronger headwinds, renewables still meet the largest share of total energy demand growth, followed by natural IEA. CC BY 4.0. Executive Summary 21 gas and oil, even though annual solar PV additions in the power sector stall at around today’s levels of 540 GW to 2035. In the STEPS, policy changes mean that the United States has 30% less renewables capacity installed in 2035 than in last year’s Outlook, but at the global level renewables continue their rapid expansion. A boom in solar deployment is accompanied by robust growth across wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and other technologies, and by improvements in energy efficiency. China continues to be the largest market for renewables, accounting for 45-60% of global deployment over the next ten years across the scenarios, and remains the largest manufacturer of most renewable technologies. Ample production capacity of solar panels and batteries, much of it in China, keeps prices competitive, but also raises concerns in some markets. In 2024, there was sufficient manufacturing capacity to have produced more than twice as many solar PV modules as were actually deployed, and almost three-times as many battery cells. China’s exports of new energy technologies, including EVs, have grown to account for nearly 5% of its total goods exports, and Chinese companies have been investing in manufacturing facilities abroad in Indonesia, Morocco, Hungary, Brazil and elsewhere. While some countries, notably developing economies, see a major opportunity to access cost-competitive technologies, there are also concerns about China’s dominance of these new value chains. A key question is what happens to this surplus capacity in the context of trade barriers, demand-side uncertainties, substantial pressures on technology prices, and falling profit margins for some producers. Nuclear power is making a comeback Another common element across scenarios is the revival of fortunes for nuclear energy, with investment rising in both traditional large-scale plants and new designs, including small modular reactors (SMRs). More than 40 countries now include nuclear energy in their strategies and are taking steps to develop new projects. In addition to reactors that are restarting operation, notably in Japan, there are more than 70 GW of new capacity under construction, one of the highest levels in 30 years. Innovation, cost control and greater visibility on future cash flows is essential to diversify a sector that has been characterised by high market concentration, including for construction, uranium production and enrichment services. Technology companies are supporting the emergence of new business models, with agreements and expressions of interest for 30 GW of SMRs, mainly to power data centres. With these developments, after more than two decades of stagnation, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least one-third to 2035. Diverging pathways for the energy mix Along with some commonalities, the scenarios diverge in the ways in which energy needs are met, reflected in differing outlooks for oil, natural gas and coal. In the CPS, demand for oil and natural gas continue to grow to 2050, although coal starts to fall back before the end of the current decade. In the STEPS, the peak in coal demand is accompanied by a flattening in oil use around 2030. However, in contrast to last year’s Outlook, gas demand continues growing into the 2030s, due mainly to changes in US policies and lower gas prices. In the NZE Scenario, much swifter deployment of a range of low-emissions technologies brings consequent declines in demand for all the fossil fuels. Although underlying demand for IEA. CC BY 4.0. 22 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 energy services is similar across the scenarios, the amount of energy required to meet it varies significantly. In the CPS, the world’s energy demand rises by 90 exajoules (EJ) to 2035 (a 15% increase from today). In the STEPS, it rises by around 50 EJ, or 8%. In an NZE world, it declines. These variations reflect differences in the energy mix and in the technical efficiency of appliances and equipment. More electrified and renewables-rich pathways also use less energy by avoiding waste heat from fuel combustion. Twists and turns for oil markets and EVs Oil markets look well supplied in the near term, thanks to a quintet of producers in the Americas – the United States, Canada, Guyana, Brazil and Argentina – and muted demand growth, but today’s downward pressures on prices do not last long in the CPS. Underlying declines in production from existing fields and continued growth in consumption run through today’s overhang of oil supply relatively quickly. Some 25 million barrels per day (mb/d) of new oil supply projects are needed to 2035 in this scenario to keep markets in balance, and oil prices rise from today’s levels to incentivise the additional upstream projects. EVs are set to account for more than 25% of new car sales globally in 2025 and battery costs have fallen dramatically, but the journey ahead for EV sales and oil demand could take several routes. In the STEPS, we have revised down EV growth projections in advanced economies compared with last year, notably in the United States. Nonetheless, the share of EVs in new car sales rises above 50% by 2035, and oil demand levels off around 2030 at 102 mb/d before starting a slow decline. In the CPS, the share of EVs in total car sales plateaus after 2035 at around 40%, and petrochemical feedstocks, aviation and trucks underpin growth in oil demand out to 113 mb/d in 2050. The NZE Scenario sees much faster electrification of the vehicle fleet, with much stronger implications for oil use. LNG looking for accommodation Final investment decisions for new LNG projects have surged in 2025, adding to the expected wave in natural gas supply in coming years and promising lower international prices. Since Russia’s cut to pipeline deliveries to Europe, LNG has become the preferred way of trading gas over long distances, reshaping global gas trade and bolstering energy security. There is now an unprecedented 300 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new annual LNG export capacity scheduled to start operation by 2030, a 50% increase in available global LNG supply. Around half is being built in the United States, and a further 20% in Qatar, followed by Canada and others. Natural gas demand has been revised up in this year’s STEPS, but questions still linger about where all the new LNG will go. Europe and China, the main destination for new LNG supply over the past decade, are set to take some of the new volumes, but the upside potential is limited in the STEPS by continued momentum behind the deployment of renewables, nuclear energy in some countries, and efficiency policies. As a result, lower priced LNG flows to other parts of the world where affordability is a key consideration, notably India and other parts of South and Southeast Asia. The response in these price\u0002sensitive markets is significant but not enough to use all of the available LNG supply in the STEPS, resulting in a 65 bcm overhang in 2030. This could be cleared by further coal-to-gas IEA. CC BY 4.0. Executive Summary 23 switching, but the prices needed to do so are difficult for LNG exporters to match. In the CPS, a slower pace of transitions sees more LNG going to China and Europe, fully absorbing the coming wave of LNG supply and keeping prices higher. In the NZE Scenario, a concerted focus on bringing down global emissions constrains the space for natural gas. In all scenarios, a downside risk to the uptake of natural gas and LNG is a failure by the industry to reduce methane leaks. The storyline for coal will be written in Asia More than for any other fuel, the dynamics in coal markets are determined by a handful of major emerging and developing economies, with China by far the most significant, followed by India, Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia. Around half of global coal demand is used for electricity generation in these economies, and the outlook for coal depends to a great extent on their needs for electricity, whether the current momentum behind renewables is sustained, and whether gas can be priced competitively enough to make inroads. In the STEPS, renewables capacity additions in emerging and developing economies average more than 600 GW per year to 2035. This is enough to put global coal demand into steady decline, a trend that is even more pronounced in the NZE Scenario. The CPS highlights what happens if grid integration challenges are high and solar and wind deployment stagnates. In this scenario, coal demand is higher and falls more slowly. Access to modern energy remains a core challenge, but there is a way forward Today, around 730 million people still live without electricity, and nearly 2 billion – one\u0002quarter of the global population – rely on cooking methods that are detrimental to human health. Countries such as India, Indonesia and China have shown how ambitious policies and large-scale programmes can transform the outlook, but less progress has been made elsewhere, notably in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. As things stand, the world is not on track to close this huge gap in the provision of modern energy. The new IEA ACCESS outlines a country-by-country pathway to universal access, reaching this milestone in 2035 for electricity and 2040 for clean cooking. It draws on lessons about what has worked best and the renewed momentum to tackle this longstanding issue, including the IEA 2024 Summit on Clean Cooking in Africa. More than half of the population without access to electricity or clean cooking lives in countries that recently upgraded policies or launched new initiatives in these areas. In our new scenario, LPG underpins most new clean cooking access, increasing its use to around 3.4 mb/d in residential cooking in 2040. At the same time, an average of 80 million people gain access to electricity each year to 2035, with rapid parallel deployment of grids, mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Diverging futures for global emissions and climate change Annual global energy-related CO2 emissions reached a record 38 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2024 and in the CPS they remain around this level, meaning that by 2050 they are some 10 Gt lower than when we last modelled this scenario in 2019; in the STEPS, emissions fall back below 30 Gt by mid-century. These trajectories point towards a temperature increase in the CPS of almost 3 °C in 2100, compared with a 2.5 °C outcome in the STEPS. In the updated NZE Scenario, continued high emissions in recent years and sluggish deployment in some IEA. CC BY 4.0. 24 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 areas mean that emissions reductions to 2030 are slower than in previous editions. Reflecting these trends, overshoot of the 1.5 °C target is now inevitable. Peak warming in the NZE Scenario exceeds 1.5 °C for several decades, returning below 1.5 °C by 2100 thanks to a very rapid transformation of the energy sector and to widespread deployment of CO2 removal technologies that are currently unproven at large scale. A pathway that mitigates the most severe risks from climate change remains feasible and there is strong momentum behind key technologies, but – ten years on from the signature of the Paris Agreement – some formal country-level commitments have waned. The United States has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and the new round of NDCs announced to date in 2025 do little, in aggregate, to move the needle beyond the outcomes already projected in the STEPS. Total energy-related emissions from countries that have already submitted new NDCs, as of November 2025, were around 20 Gt in 2024. Full implementation of their NDCs would see their emissions fall to 15-17 Gt by 2035, a reduction of 11-25% – this is aligned with the outcomes in the STEPS. There are signs that some countries, notably China, are committing to NDCs that can comfortably be exceeded in practice. Options to reduce emissions substantially are well understood and, in many cases, cost effective. They include actions to boost the uptake of wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, nuclear power and other low-emissions technologies; to improve energy efficiency; to reduce methane emissions; to increase the electrification of end-uses; and to use sustainable fuels like low-emissions hydrogen or technologies like carbon capture, utilisation and storage in cases where electrification is not practicable. The STEPS gets close to achieving the tripling in renewables capacity by 2030 targeted at COP28, with a rise to 2.6-times 2022 levels. However, the annual rate of efficiency improvement in this scenario, at 2%, is a long way from the 4% target agreed as part of the UAE Consensus. Implementing these actions at scale would require an intensified international push to increase transition-related investment in emerging and developing economies, and much more practical efforts to ensure that these investments deliver tangible near-term social and economic benefits. Mapping out the key choices Urgent energy security challenges are front and centre for today’s energy policy makers, requiring the same spirit and focus that governments showed when they created the IEA after the 1973 oil shock. Their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals, on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change. Policy makers are reaching different conclusions about the right balance to strike, the course of action that can best improve the lives of their citizens. Our scenarios do not aim to provide all the answers. But they illustrate the key decision points that lie ahead and, together, provide a framework for evidence-based, data-driven discussion over the way forward. IEA. CC BY 4.0. PART A CONTEXT AND KEY FINDINGS Part A of the World Energy Outlook gives an overview of some of the central findings from this year’s energy projections, frames them within a wider context, and describes the scenarios that underlie them. Chapter 1 sets out the key implications of different scenarios for demand, for the energy mix and for emissions. It also examines the effects of these scenarios on energy markets and energy security, and explores their implications for energy access and affordability. Chapter 2 examines trends in energy, economics and geopolitics that are shaping the global energy outlook. It also describes each of the scenarios, sets out the key assumptions that drive them, and explores some of the most important ways in which they differ. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 27 Chapter 1 Overview and key findings Ten questions on the future of energy • The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) present two views on how the energy system may evolve, building on different assumptions regarding today’s policies and technologies. Both scenarios see continued increases in energy demand to 2050, albeit at different speeds, with emerging market and developing economies driving the increase, led by India and Southeast Asia. • Differences in the pace at which new technologies are brought into the energy system are reflected in the trajectories for fossil fuels. In the CPS, oil and natural gas demand continue to grow to mid-century, although coal goes into decline before 2030. In the STEPS, coal use peaks earlier than in the CPS and oil demand flattens by the end of the decade, but natural gas demand continues to grow into the 2030s, as a wave of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports brings downward pressure on prices. • The emissions trajectory in the CPS is consistent with warming of almost 3 °C by 2100, whereas lower levels of emissions in the STEPS keep this to around 2.5 °C, slightly higher than the 2024 version of the STEPS. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario, warming peaks around 2050 at about 1.65 °C and declines slowly after that, largely due to active measures to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The resilience of energy infrastructure in the face of extreme weather and other hazards is becoming more critical. • Electricity plays a growing role in meeting energy service demand in all scenarios, supplied with rising shares of generation from renewables. Peak electricity demand rises around 40% by 2035 in the STEPS, with similar trends in the other scenarios, largely due to increased demand for cooling. Data centres and AI account for less than 10% of global growth in electricity demand, but this is a larger factor in the United States where a large share of new data centres are located. • Today, around 730 million people still live without electricity, and nearly 2 billion rely on polluting cooking methods. As things stand, the world is not on track to close this huge gap in the provision of modern energy. Our new analysis draws on lessons from countries that have achieved rapid progress and outlines a new pathway to universal access, reaching this milestone in 2035 for electricity and 2040 for clean cooking. • The nature of energy security is changing; traditional risks have not gone away but electricity and critical mineral security are rising as key priorities. Grids, storage, dispatchable generation, demand-side flexibility and close attention to the quality of grid operation are pivotal for electricity security. In critical minerals the key challenge is supply concentration, particularly in the refining sectors where a single country has an average market share of 70% in 19 out of 20 strategic energy-related minerals. SUMMARY IEA. CC BY 4.0. 28 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Introduction The last several years have been a period of extreme volatility and uncertainty, with the worst pandemic since the 1920s, the worst energy crisis since the 1970s, rapid technological change in and beyond the energy sector, increasingly visible effects of climate change, and increasingly complex geopolitics. Governments are responding in different ways to these challenges, but many are prioritising affordability, competitiveness and energy security. These are all goals which present both synergies and trade-offs with energy transitions. The scenarios included in the World Energy Outlook (WEO) provide a framework for evaluating the choices that energy decision makers face and the potential consequences of those choices for the global energy system. Change in such a complex system is driven by multiple factors:  Macroeconomic and financial conditions like interest rates, inflation and the rate and structure of gross domestic product (GDP) growth affect energy demand, investment decisions and the relative attractiveness of different technologies.  Energy policies shape the incentives faced by investors, energy companies and consumers. Policies profoundly influence outcomes, although they do not determine them. They can be overachieved, underachieved, repealed or strengthened. The extent to which they are successful depends on many things, including their legal form, their level of specificity, the incentives on offer, and the way they are implemented.  Investor strategies and capital market incentives influence investment across the energy sector. For example, the availability of capital to support the early development of the shale sector in the United States was instrumental in shaping the supply trajectory, and the way the capital market has more recently encouraged greater capital discipline has had a similarly powerful effect.  Innovation and technology progress occur in response to policies but also independently. Technologies can always surprise: artificial intelligence (AI) as a major driver of electricity demand was not on the radar several years ago. Innovations can spill over from one sector to another, as with semiconductor and solar photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing, or shale production and advanced geothermal.  Non-energy policies, trade and geopolitical trends have important consequences for the energy sector. The energy shocks of the 1970s turbo-charged efforts to improve energy efficiency, led to the first national research and development programmes in technologies like solar PV, and accelerated the deployment of commercial nuclear power. In more recent times, sanctions, tariffs and stockholding strategies have all also influenced energy markets.  Consumer preferences, biases and cultural trends influence the kinds of energy\u0002consuming equipment consumers buy and the ways in which they use them. Consumers are not pure cost-optimisers. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 29 1 Capturing all this complexity is a daunting task for any forward-looking Outlook, but these factors all feature in the design and modelling of our scenarios. None of these scenarios are forecasts: instead, they provide a way to explore the drivers and implications of different pathways. As such, we hope they provide a valuable guide for policy makers, investors and companies as they navigate an uncertain future. This chapter explores the key findings of the WEO-2025 by considering ten key questions about the future: 1. Two of the IEA scenarios, the Current Policies Scenario and the Stated Policies Scenario, are exploratory in that they work forwards from slightly different starting assumptions; what do these scenarios tell us about the direction that the energy world is heading? 2. What are the implications of all the IEA scenarios for energy-related emissions and the rise in global average temperatures, and what does this imply for the discussions at COP30 in Belém, Brazil? 3. Examining recent energy history can help to understand some distinctive aspects of the future: how are the drivers of global energy demand in the coming decades different from those in the past? 4. Electricity prices are a sensitive topic for consumers and policy makers alike: what does the prospective Age of Electricity mean for energy affordability? 5. Artificial intelligence will have implications for all parts of our economies and societies: how much difference will AI and our thirst for data make to the future of energy? 6. After some difficult years during the pandemic and the global energy crisis, there is a growing effort to regain momentum on energy access: what more needs to be done to provide universal, affordable access to electricity and clean cooking? 7. Export controls on rare earth elements in 2025 have highlighted the importance of these new dimensions to energy security: how are critical minerals and other emerging issues changing the energy security landscape? 8. Investors and project developers, led by the United States, have continued to approve multiple new export projects for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2025: where will all this LNG go? 9. As things stand, there is ample underutilised manufacturing capacity for many clean energy technologies, especially solar PV and batteries, and much of this is in China: will the world use it? 10. Answers to many of the biggest questions about the future will depend on investment: what do our energy investment projections tell us about potential gaps and risks? IEA. CC BY 4.0. 30 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 1.1 Which way is the energy world heading? 1.1.1 Electricity and emerging market and developing economies drive energy expansion The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) represent two distinct views on how the energy system may evolve, building on different assumptions regarding today’s policies and technologies (Box 1.1). However, in some respects they reveal similar outcomes. Both scenarios see continued increases in energy demand as a larger and richer global population demands more energy services. In the STEPS, total energy demand increases by around 55 exajoules (EJ) to 2035, an 8% increase over today’s level. In the CPS, it grows faster, rising by 90 EJ by the same year, or 14% (Figure 1.1). Energy service demand is broadly the same across the two scenarios: the rise in energy demand differs between them because of differences in the efficiency of technologies and fuels. Around 60% of the difference is due to increased use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and transport in the CPS, which leads to higher energy loss as waste heat. Stronger efficiency policies in the STEPS also limit energy demand growth relative to the CPS. Figure 1.1 ⊳ Total energy demand, electricity demand, and renewables in electricity generation by scenario, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity demand outpaces total energy demand growth by a wide margin; renewables account for an increasing share of surging electricity demand Note: EJ = exajoule; TWh = terawatt-hour. CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. In both scenarios, emerging market and developing economies drive nearly all the increase in global energy demand. Energy demand in advanced economies remains below its 2007 peak through to 2035 in both scenarios. Energy demand in emerging market and developing 500 1 000 2015 2024 2035 Total energy demand EJ STEPS CPS 20 40 2015 2024 2035 Electricity demand thousand TWh 25% 50% 2015 2024 2035 Renewables share in electricity generation IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 31 1 economies rises by around 15% to 2035 in the STEPS and by 20% in the CPS. In the last decade, the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter China) accounted for more than half of the demand growth outside advanced economies. However, as China’s economy matures, both scenarios see a slowdown in its demand growth. India, Southeast Asia and other developing economies become the main drivers of the increase in global energy demand. Electricity plays an increasingly important role in the functioning of modern economies, powering advanced manufacturing, high value-added services, the digital economy and AI. In the last decade, electricity demand increased two-times faster than overall energy demand. Both the CPS and the STEPS project electricity demand reaching essentially the same level in 2035, around 37 800 terawatt-hours (TWh). This represents an increase of 40% from today’s level and an acceleration of the pace of growth compared to the past decade. The drivers behind this increase vary by scenario: the electrification of new end-uses such as transport and space heating proceeds more slowly in the CPS than in the STEPS, but this effect is offset by slower increases in energy efficiency in the CPS in high growth areas such as space cooling and data centres. A decade ago, renewables accounted for around one-fifth of electricity generation worldwide. That has now risen to about one-third, reflecting cost reductions in renewable energy technologies and policy support in many markets. The share of renewables in electricity generation increases in both scenarios. However, the speed of the increase in the CPS is slower than in the STEPS as grid integration challenges mount and policy support is not extended after stipulated end-dates. The STEPS, on the other hand, sees the share of renewables in total electricity generation continue to accelerate, and it reaches nearly 55% by 2035. Despite the growth of renewables in both scenarios, neither manages to lower energy-related emissions sufficiently to avoid severe risks from a changing climate (section 1.2). Box 1.1 ⊳ Two views on the outlook for the global energy system Multiple factors influence the evolution of the energy sector: macroeconomic trends; energy and other policies; technologies and markets; and consumer preferences. Policies are a critical differentiating factor in our two exploratory scenarios: the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) and the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). Yet, policies are generally only a partial guide to the direction of travel. They are sometimes imprecise, can have unintended consequences, and are subject to change. They can be met, exceeded or underachieved; they can also be repealed or strengthened. Neither scenario targets any particular outcome, and both are grounded in a detailed analysis of the latest policies, market trends and technology developments. The differences in outcomes between them can be traced to slightly different starting assumptions, which affect how they project the energy system evolving. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 32 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025  The Current Policies Scenario builds on a narrow reading of today’s policies, taking only those that are adopted in legislation and regulation. It offers a generally cautious perspective on the speed at which new energy technologies are deployed and integrated into the energy system. It tends to project slower growth in the adoption of new technologies in the energy system than seen in recent years, or than projected in the STEPS. Consequently, the CPS projects a somewhat bigger continuing role for traditional fuels.  The Stated Policies Scenario builds on a broader reading of the policy landscape, taking account of those that have been formally tabled but not yet adopted as well as of other official strategy documents that indicate the desired direction of travel. It does not, however, assume that aspirational targets are met. It offers a more dynamic perspective on energy technology and market trends, and it projects a slightly more rapid introduction of new energy technologies than the CPS. 1.1.2 Do we still see demand peaks for coal, oil and natural gas? Demand for the three fossil fuels follows contrasting trajectories in the STEPS and the CPS. In each case, one major factor helps to explain the difference (Figure 1.2). Most global coal demand, 55%, comes from electricity generation in emerging market and developing economies, largely China. The outlook for global coal demand accordingly depends to a great extent on whether the current momentum on renewables is sustained. In the STEPS, renewables capacity additions average 620 gigawatts (GW) per year to 2035 in emerging market and developing economies, compared with 515 GW in 2024. This is sufficient to put global coal demand into a decline this decade. In the CPS, less policy support and higher assumed grid integration challenges result in slower renewables growth than in the STEPS. As a result, coal demand is higher, peaks later and declines more slowly in the CPS. In both cases, however, global coal demand starts to fall before the end of this decade. Road transport accounts for around 45% of global oil demand. The future level of oil demand is shaped to a considerable extent by improvements in the efficiency of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs). In the STEPS, the share of EVs in total global car sales doubles to 2030 and rises above 50% by 2035. This puts road transport oil demand on a declining trajectory and leads to a peak in total oil demand around 2030. In the CPS, the EV sales share broadly plateaus after 2035, and ICE vehicle fuel economy continues to improve broadly in line with historical trends (though in some advanced economies it does so a little more slowly than in the past). In 2035, total oil demand is 5 million barrels per day (mb/d) higher in the CPS than in the STEPS, with 40% of this difference due to the slowdown in EV sales. In the CPS, the flatlining of the EV sales share after 2035 contributes to continued growth in oil demand into the 2030s and beyond. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 33 1 Figure 1.2 ⊳ Demand for coal, oil and gas by major driver and scenario, 2010-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Coal and oil demand peak by 2030 in the STEPS; growth is higher in the CPS due to slower uptake of technologies such as renewables and EVs Note: btce = billion tonnes of coal equivalent; mb/d = million barrels per day; tcm = trillion cubic metres. EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. Natural gas use in electricity generation is one important determinant of the difference between the two scenarios. In the STEPS, renewables moderate the growth of natural gas\u0002fired power in major consuming regions, and lead to absolute declines in natural gas use in electricity generation in Europe and advanced economies in Asia. The net result is that global natural gas use for electricity generation increases by slightly less than 10% to 2035. In the CPS, renewables and other alternative sources of generation gain ground more slowly, and the use of natural gas for electricity rises by slightly more than 15%. The different trends in the two scenarios result in natural gas demand reaching a plateau around the middle of the 2030s in the STEPS, but continuing to increase in the CPS. The plateau in gas demand in the STEPS occurs later and at a higher level in this year’s STEPS compared with last year. 1.1.3 How do market balances play out in the different scenarios? The World Energy Outlook in 2024 (WEO-2024) noted that the turbulence caused by the 2022 energy crisis appeared to be receding and that market balances were set to ease in major fuel, commodity and energy technology markets. How market balances play out differs in the scenarios. In the CPS, higher demand mops up any excess oil and LNG supply more quickly, leading in turn to significant pressures on supply investment and higher international fuel prices in the longer term. In the STEPS, the peak in oil demand and plateau in natural gas demand help to mitigate these pressures and damp down price rises. 3 4 5 6 2010 2050 Power in EMDE Road transport Power Other STEPS CPS Coal (btce) 85 95 105 115 2010 2050 Oil (mb/d) 3 4 5 6 2010 2050 Natural gas (tcm) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 34 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 The bulk of oil and gas investment is needed in these scenarios not to meet increases in demand but to offset declines in production from existing fields. In the CPS, some 25 mb/d of new oil projects need to be approved to keep markets balanced to 2035, compared with around 20 mb/d in the STEPS, and natural gas supply from new fields reaches 1 500 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2035, compared with 1 200 bcm in the STEPS. Tighter market balances and stronger demand for supply mean that markets pull in higher cost producers, and this in turn pushes up prices. In the CPS, oil prices are around 10% higher than in the STEPS in 2035, and natural gas prices in major importing regions are around 30-40% higher. Moreover, while upstream oil and gas investment needs in the STEPS out to 2035 are broadly in line with the average level of spending in recent years, around USD 100 billion more than that average is needed every year in the CPS. Market balances for copper and lithium are stretched in both the STEPS and the CPS (section 1.7). Manufacturing capacity for low-emissions technologies such as solar PV, batteries and EVs is substantially in excess of demand in both scenarios, implying fierce competition and downward pressure on prices (section 1.9). In both scenarios, key steps of the value chain for both critical minerals and clean energy technologies continue to be dominated by a small number of countries. There is no global market for electricity, but similar underlying drivers shape individual markets. Both scenariossee a similar task ahead in terms of meeting rising peak demand and increasing needs for electricity sector flexibility. Peak electricity demand increases around 40% by 2035 in the STEPS, and by slightly more than this in the CPS, with much of the growth coming from the increasing use of appliances such as air conditioners. The projected growth in both overall and peak electricity demand underlines how complex a task it is to boost electricity resilience and security, and at the same time how important it is to succeed in doing so. Box 1.2 ⊳ How does the 2025 STEPS differ from the 2024 version? The Stated Policies Scenario is updated annually to account for changes in policies, market dynamics and technological advancements. It is instructive to look at how the projections have evolved. Changes in assumptions since the World Energy Outlook-2024 (WEO-2024) have had a material impact on the outlook for energy in this 2025 edition (Figure 1.3). Some of the largest changes since the WEO-2024 include:  Evolving policy and market backdrop: The last year has seen major new policies emerge in 48 countries, most notably in the United States. For example, the 2025 iteration of the STEPS projects 30% less renewables capacity installed in the United States in 2035 than the 2024 STEPS version, and 60% fewer EVs on the road in 2035. However, EV projections have been revised up in several other regions: for example, the 2025 STEPS sees around 20% more EVs on the road in emerging market and developing economies outside China in 2035 compared with the 2024 STEPS, reflecting recent strong sales growth. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 35 1  Higher electricity generation growth: The 2025 STEPS projects over 44 000 TWh of electricity generation worldwide in 2035, which is around 4% more than in the 2024 STEPS version. The outlook for electricity demand to serve data centres in the United States and elsewhere are higher than in the WEO-2024, and higher demand for air conditioning in the Middle East and North Africa also makes a large contribution to the overall increase in electricity demand in the 2025 STEPS. Emerging grid integration challenges in China and other major markets also help to explain the differences in the generation mix between the two editions of STEPS. Most of the upward revision in generation is coal-fired power in China.  Increased natural gas consumption: The 2025 STEPS projects 350 bcm more natural gas consumption in 2035 compared with the 2024 STEPS version. Three-quarters of this is for electricity generation, mainly in the United States, Japan and the Middle East, and reflects higher electricity demand and slower progress in adding renewables to the generation mix than projected in the WEO-2024. There is also faster growth in the use of gas for transport, notably for compressed natural gas vehicles in China and LNG for shipping, and for industry in emerging market and developing economies.

CC BY 4.0. 36 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 1.2 What are the implications of the IEA scenarios for the global climate and for COP30? 1.2.1 Outlook for emissions in the exploratory scenarios Notably, 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first in which the temperature rise from pre-industrial levels exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C).1 The last decade was also the hottest on record (WMO, 2025). As countries submit new national climate targets in accordance with the Paris Agreement, it is important to understand where we are headed and what pathways remain to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Figure 1.4 ⊳ Energy-related CO2 emissions by region and scenario IEA. CC BY 4.0. Emissions from coal-fired power generation in emerging market and developing economies account for most of the difference between the two scenarios to 2035 Note: Mt CO2 = million tonnes of carbon dioxide. CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Both our exploratory scenarios based on today’s conditions result in high emissions and high temperatures, although they differ in degree. In the CPS, energy-related emissions remain close to the 2024 level through to 2050 (Figure 1.4). Emissions from coal combustion decline marginally across the outlook, but this is offset by increases in emissions from oil and natural gas. Decreases in advanced economies and China are offset by increases in other emerging market and developing economies. In the STEPS, global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions peak in the next few years, decline modestly to 35.2 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2035, and 1 This does not mean that the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C is missed, as this goal refers to average temperatures across several decades. 32 34 36 38 40 2010 2024 2035 Coal-fired power Natural gas Industry Road transport Other Difference in emissions (Gt CO₂) STEPS CPS Global emissions(Gt CO₂) -fired power 10 20 30 40 2024 2035 2050 2035 2050 China Bunkers Advanced economies EMDE excluding China CPS STEPS IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 37 1 continue to fall slowly to 2050. Emissions fall in advanced economies from 11 Gt to 8.6 Gt by 2035, and in China from 12.7 Gt to 10.5 Gt. Emissions in other emerging market and developing economies continue to rise to 2035. Higher emissions in the CPS from coal-fired electricity, particularly in China, are the main reason for the difference in emissions between the STEPS and the CPS. They account for 1.7 Gt of the gap between them in 2035. Slower increases in efficiency and electrification in industry in the CPS account for a further 0.6 Gt of the difference, and lower EV sales and slower increases in the efficiency of ICE vehicles for another 0.3 Gt. 1.2.2 Temperature outcomes in the scenarios The long-term global average rise in temperatures above pre-industrial levels was around 1.4 °C in 2024 and since 1980 has been increasing by around 0.2 °C per decade. All scenarios exceed warming of 1.5 °C by around 2030, but differences in climate outcomes between the WEO scenarios begin to emerge after 2035. In the CPS, warming exceeds 2 °C around 2050, reaches 2.9 °C in 2100, and is set to keep rising from there (Figure 1.5). Figure 1.5 ⊳ Global average temperature rise, and annual emissions reductions from peak to 2035 in past NZE Scenario editions IEA. CC BY 4.0. The average temperature rise reaches 2.9 °C in 2100 in the CPS, 2.5 °C in the STEPS, and in the NZE Scenario it peaks at around 1.65 °C in 2050 and falls below 1.5 °C in 2100 Notes: Gt = gigatonnes.

CC BY 4.0. 38 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 In the STEPS, lower levels of emissions produce outcomes that diverge somewhat from those in the CPS. Warming exceeds 2 °C by around 2060 and reaches around 2.5 °C by 2100. The 2025 version of STEPS shows an increase in warming compared to its previous iterations. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), warming peaks around 2050 at about 1.65 °C and declines slowly after that. This decline is due to active measures to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, and the natural cooling of the earth system after net zero CO2 emissions are reached. By 2100, warming drops back to below 1.5 °C. Inherent uncertainties in how the earth system responds to future emissions and warming mean that higher temperature outcomes cannot be ruled out, highlighting the importance of limiting the risks of extreme outcomes. There is a 5% chance of warming above 4 °C in the CPS in 2100, for example. Whatever its level may be, future warming from current levels is inevitable in all our scenarios and carries with it risks, including the risk that crucial tipping points will be reached. Those risks become extreme at the upper end of the levels of warming possible in the STEPS and the CPS scenarios. 1.2.3 A limited overshoot pathway to 1.5 °C has slipped out of reach, but avoiding the worst climate outcomes is still possible The IEA has presented its NZE Scenario every year since 2021. It translates the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C into a global pathway for the energy sector. Each country will determine its own pathway: the aim of the NZE Scenario is not to prescribe the same path for all, but rather to show what a global pathway looks like. In each successive edition of the NZE Scenario, the near-term emissions reductions required to prevent warming substantially exceeding 1.5 °C has become more challenging. Actual emissions have risen year after year, and continued investment in high-emitting infrastructure has constrained the path ahead. To meet the near-term emissions benchmarks necessary to avoid substantially exceeding the 1.5 °C target, each successive edition of the NZE Scenario has featured more rapid near-term emissions reductions, stretching feasibility to its limits. This year, the short-term emissions trajectory in the NZE Scenario has been revised upward following in-depth sector-by-sector analysis of technology deployment. Compared with previous versions of the NZE Scenario, energy efficiency gains take place at a slower speed, the pace of electrification of some end-uses is less rapid, and the deployments of hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage in the near term proceed more slowly. As a result of higher near-term emissions, the NZE Scenario now results in a higher and longer overshoot of the 1.5 °C goal. It is now all but certain that 1.5 °C of warming will be exceeded within a decade or less, and that pathways that limit this overshoot of 1.5 °C to low levels have now slipped out of reach. The NZE Scenario reflects the emerging reality that any realistic pathway to stabilising warming below 1.5 °C in the long term will entail a high IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 39 1 overshoot of the 1.5 °C target in the coming years. Technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere are expensive and unproven at scale, and everything must therefore be done to limit reliance on them by reducing emissions as far and fast as possible. However, if warming is to be brought below 1.5 °C, immediate and rapid emissions reductions must be combined with strategies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere at scale in the decades to come. In the NZE Scenario, global emissions fall by over half by 2035 from their 2024 level and reach net zero by 2050. Annual CO2 removal using the technologies available reach 2.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2)in 2050 and 3.8 Gt CO2 in 2100. In 2100, this would mean removing the equivalent of the current combined annual energy-related CO2 emissions of India and Indonesia from the atmosphere. 1.2.4 What can be done to get on track? The world is clearly not on track to meet internationally agreed climate goals and is facing a challenging set of economic and geopolitical conditions. However, there is significant momentum behind many clean energy technologies, and the options to reduce emissions substantially in the near term are well understood and, in many cases, cost effective. Although the current round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) has seen reasonably high levels of participation, the scope for progress and the scale of domestic policy ambitions do not seem to have been captured in the updated NDCs in aggregate (Box 1.3). Box 1.3 ⊳ What are the implications of the NDCs that have been put forward? The Paris Agreement calls on countries to revise their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years, and stipulates that each revision should represent an increase in ambition. As of early November, countries representing around 55% of global energy-related emissions had submitted their new NDCs. In January 2025, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The full impact of updated NDCs will be reflected in future analysis; a high-level assessment is shown here. Total energy-related CO2 emissions from countries with new NDCs were around 20 Gt in 2024 (Figure 1.6). Full implementation of NDCs would see their emissions fall to 15-17 Gt by 2035, a reduction of 10-25% below current levels. This is in line with the STEPS and would mean emissions falling faster than envisaged in the CPS. In aggregate, however, the NDCs do not imply additional ambition beyond what is currently seen in the policies and market trends captured in the STEPS. This aggregate picture masks significant differences between countries. Some countries have submitted NDCs that appear less ambitious than they could be in light of current policy and market trends. For example, China’s NDC goal of reaching 3 350-3 600 GW of installed wind and solar capacity by 2035 implies an annual rate of capacity additions of 160-180 GW per year. This compares to around 400 GW of additions in 2024, and the IEA. CC BY 4.0. 40 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 goal is achieved before 2030 in the CPS and the STEPS. Other countries have put forward NDCs that imply a faster rate of emissions reductions than captured in the STEPS, indicating that they will need to introduce new policies to deliver on their NDC pledges. Figure 1.6 ⊳ Energy-related emissions trajectories from NDC submissions relative to the Current Policies and Stated Policies scenarios IEA. CC BY 4.0. Targets for 2035 in announced second-round NDCs show broadly the same level of ambition as first-round NDCs, and are in line with the trajectory in the STEPS Notes: Gt CO2 = billion tonnes of carbon dioxide; NDCs = Nationally Determined Contributions. CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. The estimates aggregate selected countries with 2035 indicative targets announced at the United Nations Climate Summit on 24 September 2025 and the Nationally Determined Contributions submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat as of mid-October 2025. Several key actions are necessary to put the world on an energy system pathway more closely aligned with internationally agreed climate goals. They include actions to boost the uptake of renewables and other low-emissions technologies, to improve energy efficiency, to reduce methane emissions, to increase the electrification of end-uses, and to use sustainable fuels where electrification is not practicable (Figure 1.7). Renewables are already expanding strongly; new capacity of over 680 GW was added in 2024. In the STEPS, the global installed capacity of renewables increases from around 4 900 GW in 2024 to around 13 700 GW in 2035, an increase of 2.8-times. This is around 70% of the capacity increase required in the NZE Scenario by 2035, which sees the installed capacity of renewables reach 19 600 GW in 2035. Nuclear and low-emissions fuels also have a part to play, as do actions to improve grid flexibility and resilience in order to facilitate the integration of renewables. Installed nuclear capacity expands by 70% by 2035 in the NZE Scenario. 5 10 15 20 25 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 Gt CO₂ Revised first NDCs Second NDCs STEPS CPS IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Scaling up low-emissions electricity generation, improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions of methane are critical actions to get back on track Notes: GW = gigawatt; EJ = exajoule; PPP = purchasing power parity; GJ = gigajoule; Mt = million tonnes. Sustainable fuels include liquid biofuels, biogases, low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, including hydrogen produced and consumed onsite. There are various ways to improve the energy efficiency of the global economy. They include: switching to more efficient fuels such as electricity; increasing the efficiency of factories, houses and appliances; and delivering universal access to modern forms of energy. In the STEPS, efficiency increases by around 2% per year to 2035, meaning that the global economy produces more than one-quarter more output per unit of energy used than today. In the CPS, this rate of increase is slower. In the NZE Scenario, the rate of improvement doubles to 4% a year by 2030, and it stays at that level to 2035. The energy sector is responsible for methane emissions of around 4.4 gigatonnes of carbon\u0002dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2-eq). Major reductions in methane emissions can be achieved with well-known measures at low cost. In the NZE Scenario, methane emissions are reduced by 80% from their 2024 level by 2035. The reductions in the STEPS and the CPS are around 20% and 5% respectively. Electricity currently accounts for around one-fifth of global energy consumption. Increasing the share of electricity in end-uses has a central part to play to reduce emissions from the end-use sectors. In the STEPS, electricity increases to around one-quarter of global energy consumption by 2035. Increased deployment of EVs, heat pumps and other electrical technologies push this share to around one-third by 2035 in the NZE Scenario. However, electricity alone cannot fully eliminate emissions from energy consumption. Sustainable fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels are also required. In the NZE Scenario, their use increases by more than four-times by 2035. 2024 2035 Renewable capacity Thousand GW 20 10 2024 2035 Energy productivity USD PPP per GJ 600 300 2024 2035 Methane emissions Mt 160 80 2024 2035 Nuclear capacity GW 800 400 2024 2035 Sustainable fuels EJ 40 20 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 42 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 1.3 How are the drivers of future global energy demand different from those in the past? Between 2000 and 2010, global energy consumption rose at an average annual rate of 2.4%. Then the pace slowed, with growth in consumption falling to an average of 1.3% per year from 2010 to 2024. In the CPS, total final consumption continues to grow at the current rate up to 2035. In contrast, the STEPS sees a slowdown, with annual growth of 1%, while faster electrification and other efficiency gains in the NZE Scenario allow for an annual decline in energy consumption of around 1% up to 2035. 1.3.1 Drivers of energy growth of the past are not the ones of tomorrow The factors driving global energy demand are shifting. Demographic factors, once a major influence, are waning as population growth slows and even reverses in many advanced economies, the Russian Federation (hereinafter Russia) and China (Figure 1.8). The global population is set to continue to grow, but the average annual increase of 80 million since 2000 is projected to slow to 65 million per year up to 2035 and then to 50 million to 2050. Two-thirds of the world’s population already lives in countries with fertility rates that are below the replacement rate (UN DESA, 2025). Figure 1.8 ⊳ Annual growth of selected demand drivers by time period, 2000-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Growth in conventional energy demand drivers is set to slow significantly in the coming years, though cooling needs accelerates Industrial production – a pillar of energy demand growth – is also evolving.

Their contributions fell to 2% and 7% between 2010 and 2024, and are set to decline further through to 2050 as growth in these sub-sectors slows. Meanwhile, other industries such as plastics and manufacturing are rapidly expanding. In the transport sector, the locus of demand is also shifting. During the 2000s, advanced economies accounted for around half of the increase in the global stock of cars. In the following decade, China alone accounted for half. Between now and 2035, rising ownership rates lead to emerging market and developing economies other than China accounting for half of the increase in the stock of cars as advanced economies see car ownership reach a plateau. Energy demand patterns are also changing in the buildings sector. Space cooling is increasingly a leading driver of demand as rising temperatures stimulate more use of air conditioning, especially in emerging market and developing economies where average incomes are steadily increasing (Figure 1.9). While appliances remain significant, the overall balance of energy consumption in buildings is clearly tilting towards emerging market and developing economies and end-uses, reflecting broader shifts in economic activity and climate trends. Figure 1.9 ⊳ Average annual net growth in total final consumption in selected end-uses, 2000-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Growth in energy consumption is shifting from traditional industries and cars to non-energy-intensive industries and cooling Note: I&S = iron and steel; non-EIT = non-energy-intensive industries; Petchem = high value chemicals. CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. 1.3.2 Engines of demand growth are shifting across fuels and regions Energy consumption growth was largely driven by advanced economies from the start of the Industrial Revolution through to the end of the 20th century.

CC BY 4.0. 44 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 main engine of global energy consumption growth as its industrial output and household consumption expanded at dizzying speed (Figure 1.10). For example, China accounted for more than half of oil and natural gas consumption growth from 2010 to 2024, and 60% of electricity demand growth. Now China is moving towards a less infrastructure and energy-intensive growth model. This shift is reflected in a peak in production in some energy-intensive industries, e.g. cement and steel, and the transition to more electricity-intensive sectors, such as clean technology manufacturing, along with more stringent efficiency measures and increasing uptake of EVs. It is putting China on a different energy path, in which electricity demand continues to rise rapidly but growth in fossil fuel consumption is much less pronounced. In both the CPS and the STEPS, emerging market and developing economies other than China take over as the primary drivers of energy consumption growth and see energy consumption increase across all sectors. India and Indonesia stand out, with annual increases in energy consumption of between 3% and 3.6% to 2035. Figure 1.10 ⊳ Total final consumption annual increase by region, fuel and scenario, 2000-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Other includes district heating, solar thermal and geothermal, bioenergy and waste. Historically, most of the increase in energy consumption was met by fossil fuels.

Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 45 1 differ in how the energy services demand is met. Differences in the stringency of efficiency policies, in fuel mixes and in electrification underpin the variances in the outlook for total energy consumption. In the CPS, total energy consumption increases by 1.3% per year to 2035, and by 1% in the STEPS. Electricity has always been essential to a wide range of activities, but the development of clean technologies in the STEPS boosts its attractiveness, and it meets more than two-thirds of consumption growth in the next decade. In the CPS, the pace of clean technologies deployment is slower, which means that a higher proportion of energy consumption comes from fossil fuels. In the NZE Scenario, global final consumption drops by 4 EJ a year on average over the next decade, with 75% of the decline in advanced economies. While electricity consumption grows by a similar amount as in other scenarios, in the NZE Scenario the consumption of fossil fuels drops by 8 EJ annually, led by oil. 1.3.3 Clean technologies and emerging sectors redefine growth A range of clean energy technologies made rapid progress over the last decade, and particularly in recent years. Since 2020, global EV sales have surged, heat pump sales rose by more than 25%, and the technology readiness level of several industrial technologies, most notably industrial heat pumps, has advanced. In some regions, new desalination capacity shifted from thermal-based systems to fully electric ones. In parallel, structural changes in economies and the emergence of new demand drivers, such as AI and clean technology manufacturing, are pushing up energy consumption in specific industrial sub-sectors. Figure 1.11 ⊳ Total final consumption growth by sector, end-use type and scenario, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. 46 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 In the STEPS, such emerging uses and clean technologies account for around half of consumption increases in transport and one-third in buildings (Figure 1.11). Their share is lower in industry: existing technologies meet most of the energy consumption increase as financial and infrastructure barriers continue to hinder the deployment of industrial heat pumps and electrolytic hydrogen at scale. In the CPS, deployment of some of the new technologies is considerably slower, notably EVs and heat pumps. In contrast, the NZE Scenario places end-uses on a decarbonisation path where new clean energy technologies become the sole drivers of consumption growth within each sector. Box 1.4 ⊳ Demand grows where the sun shines over the next decade Many emerging market and developing economies outside China have excellent solar potential. They include India and a number of countries in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. While regions with medium to low solar conditions accounted for half of energy consumption growth over the past decade, their share is projected to more than halve in the coming decade in the STEPS. By 2035, 80% of energy consumption growth occurs in regions with average irradiation above 4.5 kilowatt-hours per square metre (kWh/m2) per day, and 35% of total consumption growth takes the form of demand for electricity (Figure 1.12).

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 47 1 Favourable solar conditions present both a demand challenge and a supply opportunity. In many regions, strong solar irradiation coincides with high daytime temperatures, driving up demand for air conditioning. In parts of the Middle East, India and Africa, cooling is not just a matter of comfort but a necessity for health and life. In these regions, cooling is a major contributor to electricity demand growth, accounting on average for 20% of the total between now and 2035 (IEA, 2025a). At the same time, these conditions provide an opportunity to harness abundant solar resources that should translate into higher average capacity factors for solar PV than currently registered, and potentially lower average generation costs. In the STEPS, solar PV meets over half of the additional electricity demand projected by 2035 in the Middle East, India and Africa. 1.4 What does the Age of Electricity mean for affordability? Electricity bills are rising up the political agenda in many parts of the world as households and businesses grapple with higher costs. In the emerging Age of Electricity – where reliable electricity is increasingly central to modern daily life – the price of electricity is becoming a defining indicator of energy affordability. This shift underscores a growing tension: while electrification offers long-term efficiency gains and emissions reductions, it also increases the sensitivity of movements in electricity prices, which are shaped by a complex mix of fuel costs, infrastructure investment, market design and policy choices. 1.4.1 Household electricity demand The Age of Electricity is reshaping household energy consumption patterns worldwide. As electrification expands across sectors, electricity is becoming a more prominent component of total household energy demand. Globally, average household electricity consumption is projected to rise 25% by 2035 and 60% by 2050 in the STEPS, though regional trends vary (Figure 1.13). This reflects not only the continued use of air conditioners and appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, but also the increasing adoption of EVs and electric heating systems. In most cases, these new uses of electricity displace natural gas and oil. Electrification proceeds more slowly in the CPS, while more rapid deployment of EVs and heat pumps in the NZE Scenario push it forward faster than in the STEPS or the CPS. In advanced economies, household electricity demand is projected to reverse a decade-long trend of stagnation. In the STEPS, it increases about 15% by 2035 and close to 35% by 2050. While increases in energy efficiency moderate consumption for appliances, the electrification of transport is a major driver of expanding electricity use in regions with supportive policy frameworks and increasing EV sales shares. This shift underscores the need for grid readiness and demand flexibility solutions like smart charging to manage peak demand and to improve affordability. In emerging market and developing economies excluding China, household electricity demand is poised to accelerate significantly, rising 30% by 2035 and 90% by 2050. The IEA. CC BY 4.0. 48 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 primary reason is the increasing use of air conditioning as higher incomes and temperatures boost demand for space cooling. In China, home charging of the rapidly expanding number of EVs is also contributing to higher household electricity consumption. As electrification deepens, ensuring reliable and affordable access to electricity will be critical – not only to meet more demand, but also to support broader development and sustainability goals. Figure 1.13 ⊳ Total household electricity consumption by end-use in selected regions in the STEPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. EVs, space heating, cooling and appliances drive growth in household electricity consumption Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour. EMDE excl. China = emerging market and developing economies excluding China. EV charging considers the total charging needs of all electric passenger light-duty vehicles irrespective of whether they are charged at home, at work or at public chargers. Other includes water heating, cooking and lighting. 1.4.2 Pressures on electricity prices Rapid growth in electricity demand brings with it a need for substantial investment across the power sector. Grid infrastructure, in particular, is seeing a marked increase in capital spending to connect new loads, integrate new sources of electricity and enhance resilience. While rising investment does not necessarily translate into higher average system costs – especially if demand rises in parallel – the financing conditions and timing of the investment are critical. Power generation capacity is also expanding, with renewables leading the way. New coal- and gas-fired capacity is coming online alongside renewables to meet demand growth and strengthen system security, but these fossil fuel plants are likely to be called upon to operate less frequently as time goes by. Battery storage is expanding rapidly to support the integration of variable renewables, and contributing to a more capital-intensive cost structure for electricity overall (Figure 1.14). 1 000 2 000 3 000 4 000 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 EV charging Space heating Space cooling Appliances Other TWh Advanced economies EMDE excl.

CC BY 4.0. The transformation of electricity systems entails a shift in cost structure, from fuel and operational expenses towards upfront investments in clean technologies and infrastructure Notes: MWh = megawatt-hour; MER = market exchange rate; O&M = operation and maintenance. CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Grid\u0002related costs include capital recovery costs for electricity transmission and distribution systems and grid operation and maintenance costs. Infrastructure is not the only factor exerting upward pressure on electricity prices. Carbon pricing, as embodied in mechanisms such as the emissions trading systems in the European Union and China, is raising costs for fossil fuel-based generation, although carbon taxes or carbon allowance auction revenues can be recycled to consumers. Tight supply chains are also having a visible impact across the energy sector, increasing the cost of equipment, labour and materials. Market design has a significant influence: if natural gas or oil-fired units continue to set prices most of the time even as their energy share falls, infra‑marginal rents for other generators may rise. While the price differentials that exist in this kind of market can incentivise the provision of additional flexibility, for example through the deployment of batteries or demand response, they risk straining affordability if driven by fuel price shocks or market power. Solutions include accelerating grid and interconnection projects, improving market oversight, and offering long‑term contracts or targeted support to protect consumers, while keeping price signals intact. At the same time, several forces help to moderate electricity prices. In many regions, natural gas prices are projected to decline over the coming decade as large volumes of LNG come on stream. Diversification of energy sources and a lower level of reliance on fossil fuels are reducing exposure to volatile fuel markets. As electricity demand rises, the fixed costs of new infrastructure can be spread across a larger volume of consumption, potentially reducing the 30 60 90 120 150 180 2024 CPS STEPS 2035 NZE 2024 CPS STEPS 2035 NZE 2024 CPS STEPS 2035 NZE Fuel and CO₂ costs for power plants O&M power plants and storage costs Capital costs for power plants and storage Grid-related costs USD per MWh (2024, MER) Europe United States China IEA. CC BY 4.0. 50 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 cost per megawatt-hour. In some cases, this dynamic may even lead to lower electricity prices in real terms despite rising investment levels, highlighting the importance of well\u0002designed policies and market frameworks that enable efficient investment recovery while protecting consumers. The factors influencing electricity price stability are also shifting. Reduced dependence on fossil fuels can provide insulation from market price shocks, as highlighted in Chapter 5. Increased reliance on weather-dependent renewables introduces a different kind of variability. However, analysis of seasonal patterns over the past 30 years shows that, while weather-related effects vary by region and can be significant, their impacts on electricity costs and prices are generally much smaller than the volatility related to fossil fuel price fluctuations. In many regions, short-term and seasonal flexibility needs are projected to rise substantially by 2050, but systems are increasingly able to manage these shifts through demand response, battery storage, interconnection and sector coupling (IEA, 2024). These findings suggest that while rising deployment of weather-dependent renewables bring new challenges, well-designed systems with enough flexibility can mitigate volatility and maintain price stability even where renewables become dominant. Climate change poses additional risks to electricity prices. Higher temperatures can reduce the availability of thermal and hydropower assets and impair the performance of grid infrastructure. At the same time, they may lead to higher demand, notably from cooling. This underlines the importance of grid investment: delays could pose risks to the stability of electricity prices, given that grid congestion can lead to higher wholesale market and retail electricity prices through the curtailment of renewables, the use of less efficient or more costly generators and reduced market competition. 1.4.3 Household electricity bills Household electricity bills are projected to rise across most regions as electrification deepens and demand increases, though the scale varies. While increases are modest in advanced economies, they are more pronounced in emerging market and developing economies, where access and appliance ownership expand; they are especially large in China, where end\u0002uses electrify rapidly. The impact on total household energy bills depends to a large extent on the scenario. In the STEPS, and even more so in the CPS, higher electricity outlays are only partly offset in some regions by gradual declines in spending on natural gas and oil for heating and transport (Figure 1.15). As a result, while total energy bills fall in advanced economies, they rise modestly in emerging market and developing economies, including China. In the NZE Scenario, faster efficiency gains and a more rapid shift away from fossil fuels – through heat pumps and EVs – more than compensate for higher electricity spending, even when the effects of phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies are taken into account. Although this scenario requires higher upfront spending on new equipment and efficiency improvements, it leads to a clear decline in total household energy bills in advanced economies and to bills that are broadly in line with today’s in real terms in China and other emerging market and developing economies. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 51 1 It is important to note that energy prices and both electricity and total energy bills may still rise over time in nominal terms because of general price inflation, even though they remain stable or fall when expressed in real, inflation‑adjusted terms, as in this Outlook. Figure 1.15 ⊳ Electricity and total household energy bills by region and scenario, 2024, 2035 and 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Spending on electricity increases in most markets, though this can help reduce other energy bills, leading to declines in advanced economies and smaller increases elsewhere Notes: MER = market exchange rate; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.

Total energy expenditures in nominal terms assume a constant 2% yearly inflation rate. 1.5 How much difference will AI make to the future of energy? 1.5.1 Electricity demand outlook from data centres In recent years, technology companies worldwide have been investing heavily in new data centre capacity to train and deploy increasingly large and widely used AI models. In 2025, around USD 580 billion is estimated to be invested in data centres (IEA, 2025b). This is more than total global investment in oil supply, which is projected to be around USD 540 billion in 2025. This point of comparison provides a telling marker of the changing nature of modern, highly digitalised economies. Driven by surging data centre expansion, electricity consumption by AI-optimised servers increases fivefold by 2030. This contributes to a doubling of total electricity consumption by data centres by 2030 (Figure 1.16). Despite this rapid growth, data centres account for less 1 000 2 000 3 000 4 000 5 000 6 000 2024 CPS STEPS NZE CPS STEPS NZE Electricity Other energy Total (nominal terms) USD per household (2024, MER) Advanced economies 2035 2050 2035 2050 2035 2050 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 2024 CPS STEPS NZE CPS STEPS NZE 2024 CPS STEPS NZE CPS STEPS NZE EMDE excluding China China IEA.

Other sources, including industry, EVs and air conditioners, account for more of the growth in electricity demand. Figure 1.16 ⊳ Electricity consumption in data centres by server type, and global and regional electricity demand in the STEPS, 2024-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Even as electricity consumption from AI-optimised servers surges, data centres remain just one of the many sources of electricity demand growth in most economies *Space and water heating in buildings. Note: TWh = terawatt-hour; AI = artificial intelligence; EIT = energy-intensive industry; US = United States; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Data centres are geographically concentrated, with the United States, China and Europe accounting for 82% of global capacity. Over the next few years, over 85% of data centre capacity additions are set to take place in these three regions. In China and the European Union, data centres account for 6-10% of the growth in electricity demand to 2030. This is much lower than the comparable figure in the United States – the world’s largest market for data centres – where data centres account around half of the growth in electricity demand in this period. Aggregate values do not reveal the full picture. A geospatial analysis of the data centre project pipeline reveals that over half of data centres under construction or announced are being developed in or close to cities with a population of at least 1 million people, where grids already cater to large loads; that 55% of the data centres in the pipeline are larger than 200 megawatts (MW) in capacity, and would each consume as much electricity each year as around 200 000 households when they fully come online; and that nearly two-thirds of these upcoming data centres are in regions that are existing data centre clusters (Figure 1.17). 50% 100% US AE China EMDE Data centres Other sectors Electricity demand growth by region, 2024-2030 Global growth in electricity demand, 2024-2030 (TWh) 500 1 000 2024 2030 Conventional servers AI-optimised servers Data centre electricity consumption (TWh) 750 1 500 EIT Heating* Data centres Space cooling Electric transport Appliances Non-EIT IEA.

The majority of data centres in the pipeline are larger than 200 MW, are in clusters in and around large cities, and are located in the United States, China and Europe Notes: GW = gigawatt; MW = megawatt. Data centre clusters here refer to collections of facilities grouped according to the DBSCAN clustering algorithm using a neighbourhood radius of 100 km. Large clusters have at least 500 MW of maximum designed capacity and small clusters have between 100 MW and 500 MW of maximum designed capacity. Large cities refer to locations within 100 km of the centroid of cities with a population of at least 1 million people. Source: IEA analysis based on data from (OMDIA, 2025) and (IDC, 2024). This rapid build out of data centres – especially in clusters and around urban areas – comes with challenges. Grid congestion and connection queues are increasing in many regions, and connection queues for new data centres are often already long. While queue times are one to three years in the United States on average, it can take up to seven yearsto get connected in northern Virginia. In the United Kingdom and parts of Europe, the average time in the queue has been reported to be as high as seven or ten years. In Dublin, a data centre hub, new data centre connection requests have been paused until 2028. In addition, supply chains for key components like transformers, cables, gas turbines and critical minerals are already under pressure. For example, the backlog for the delivery of transformers has been lengthening, impacting the rollout of infrastructure catering to data centre construction. IEA analysis estimates that because of these factors, around 20% of the projected data centre additions by 2030 could be at risk of delay. 1.5.2 Electricity supply to meet data centre loads The rapid rollout of data centres also has implications for supply. Most data centres are connected to the grid, and the electricity mix they consume reflects the electricity mix of the region in which they are located. At the global level, renewables remain the leading source of additional electricity for data centres in the STEPS, contributing around 45% of the growth 25% 50% 75% 100% Location Capacity Cluster Region Close to large cities Not close to large cities Large cluster Small cluster Not in existing cluster United States China Europe Other >1GW 200 MW - 1 GW <200 MW IEA. CC BY 4.0. 54 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 through to 2035, nearly 400 TWh. In the CPS, renewables also provide the largest share of incremental supply, although at around 40% it is slightly lower than in the STEPS. Natural gas also plays a key role to meet electricity demand growth from data centres, particularly in certain markets such as the United States and the Middle East. Global natural gas-fired generation for data centres increases by 220 TWh to 2035 in the STEPS, and by 285 TWh in the CPS. However, the surge in orders for new gas turbines over the past two years has strained supply chains, increasing both wait times and delivery costs. Nuclear power is experiencing renewed policy support in many markets, and the technology sector is showing increasing interest in powering data centres with nuclear. In recent months, technology companies and utilities have announced deals to extend the lifetime of existing nuclear plants, and the first power purchase agreement has been signed with a demonstration small modular reactor to power a data centre. In the STEPS, nuclear power provides 190 TWh of additional electricity for data centres by 2035. 1.5.3 AI for energy The role of AI in the energy sector goes well beyond being a driver of energy demand. AI is also important to the energy sector because of its potential to enhance the efficiency, security and cost effectiveness of energy operations (IEA, 2025b). AI is already being deployed in the oil and gas industry, in electricity generation and supply, and in energy\u0002consuming sectors, but its potential goes well beyond its present uses. IEA analysis indicates that widespread uptake of AI-related solutions for the energy sector has the potential to boost efficiency by 3-10% across the transport and industry sectors globally by 2035 (Figure 1.18). This equates to total energy savings of 13.5 EJ, which is slightly larger than the total energy demand of Indonesia today. Widespread adoption of AI-led optimisation could facilitate the achievement of energy efficiency targets and unlock emissions reductions across key sectors. None of this is a given. Limited access to high-quality data sets, insufficient digital infrastructure, regulatory concerns around privacy and the need to manage cybersecurity risks are all barriers to making full use of AI. There is also a risk of rebound effects, for example if increasingly automated private transport contributes to a modal shift away from public transport. AI also offers potential to accelerate innovation in energy technologies. Many innovation challenges are characterised by the kinds of problems that AI is good at solving: multicriteria searches through extremely large and complex data sets to find optimal designs for materials, chemistries or catalysts, for example. However, the value of such searches depends critically on the data that is searched being sufficiently extensive, robust and information-rich to generate useful predictions. Once an AI model proposes candidates for further analysis, they need to be lab tested, integrated into working prototypes, and demonstrated at commercial scale. To make a real-world impact, products then need to be scaled into industrial supply chains and deployed. All of this takes time. Furthermore, some technologies may still involve a cost or efficiency penalty that hinders their adoption even after extensive AI-driven improvements. AI is therefore a useful tool, not a magic wand.

Materials research related to batteries considers historical global research and development for screening potential candidates. Conventional methods include both physical experiments and detailed mechanistic computer simulations. 1.5.4 Known unknowns: a longer term view of AI implications on the outlook While the World Energy Outlook takes a relatively long-term look at energy trajectories, its analysis on AI focuses on the near term. AI is a disruptive technology with huge promise, uncertainty and hype. Its broader economic and social impacts are not yet fully visible. There are in addition several “known unknowns” that could affect the course of its development and its implications for the energy outlook. These include:  GDP growth and rebound effects: The impact of AI on productivity and GDP growth is highly uncertain. Quantitative estimates range from modest to transformative. Higher GDP growth could lead to higher energy demand. There are potential GDP downsides as well, if the huge investment and valuation underpinning the current AI boom turn out to be misplaced in the near term.  Efficiency trends in hardware and software: Huge progress is being made to improve the efficiency of AI-optimised chips, and breakthroughs in computing paradigms are possible. There is similar potential for improvements in the efficiency of AI models. Recent analysis from Google highlights these trends, reporting a 33-fold reduction in the per-prompt energy consumption of its Gemini model median prompt in just 12 months (Elsworth et al., 2025). Candidates analysed by AI Candidates analysed by conventional methods ~200 000 Analysis of battery materials 32 million 2% 4% 6% 8% 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Cars Trucks Iron and steel Aviation Cement Buses Rail EJ Energy savings Reduction in energy consumption (right axis) Savings from the widespread adoption of AI-based optimisations IEA. CC BY 4.0. 56 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025  AI uptake: The scale of uptake of AI remains uncertain. The type of AI use also matters. Video and image generation are much more energy intensive than text generation. Agentic AI workloads, where AI models perform extended online tasks, are also highly energy intensive.  Innovation in the energy system: Perhaps the most substantial mid-term impact of the use of AI in the energy sector could come from accelerated innovation in energy technologies. Sudden solutions to highly complex engineering and scientific challenges should not be banked on. Over time, however, incremental accelerations to energy innovation could have substantial, but uncertain, cumulative effects. As and when these impacts become apparent, their implications will need to be factored into the outlook. The IEA will continue to monitor the energy sector and broader AI impacts closely. 1.6 What more needs to be done to provide universal, affordable access to electricity and clean cooking? Achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking is an integral part of strategies for economic and human development. Remarkable progress has been made over the past two decades: since 2000, 1.6 billion people have gained access to electricity, and 2.2 billion have moved away from traditional, inefficient cooking methods that harm both health and the environment. Yet the challenge remains vast. Today, around 730 million people still live without electricity, and nearly 2 billion – one-quarter of the global population – continue to rely on polluting cooking methods. Developing countries in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean have led progress over the past decades. Both regions have now achieved electrification rates of 98% and have registered major gains in clean cooking. Since 2010, almost 1.5 billion people in these regions have gained access to modern stoves and fuels, halving the total number of people without clean cooking in just fifteen years. Countries such as India, Indonesia and China have shown how ambitious policies and large-scale programmes can transform access, but less progress has been made in other countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, electrification and clean cooking initiatives have not kept pace with rapid population growth: the region remains home to 80% of the world’s population that lack access to electricity, and the number of people lacking clean cooking solutions continues to rise. Global progress has slowed in recent years. The Covid-19 pandemic, together with the impacts of the global energy crisis, strained public budgets and made affordability an even bigger challenge. Countries with large remaining access gaps face particularly steep barriers, including high financing costs, heavy debt burdens and shrinking development budgets. In 2022, for the first time in decades, the number of people without access to electricity increased worldwide. That trend has since reversed, but progress remains slower than before the pandemic across all regions. While declining costs for solar PV and batteries, innovative IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 57 1 business models, new policy initiatives and fresh investment momentum for both electricity and clean cooking access have brought encouraging signs, current trajectories fall short of the pace required to deliver universal access over the next decade and even by mid-century. Successful examples from around the world show that ambitious access programmes can close large gaps in a relatively short time. The priority now is to build on these best practices by accelerating and scaling proven, affordable solutions, policy frameworks and programmes while tackling the barriers that continue to hold back progress in the regions most in need. Building on the analysis in Chapter 6, this section explores current trends and what more needs to be done to achieve universal access to modern energy services. It introduces a new scenario, the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS), which projects how access rates would increase if countries were able to replicate the best rates of progress witnessed in other countries. 1.6.1 Clean cooking access The pace of progress to expand access has slowed in recent years. In 2019, almost 120 million people globally gained access to clean cooking, while in 2023, 100 million people did so (Figure 1.19). In Asia, the countries that drove improvements over the past decades are seeing progress slow as they approach universal access. Part of this deceleration is offset by faster progress in Pakistan, Cambodia and Myanmar, which each recorded all-time highs in households gaining access in 2023. In Latin America and the Caribbean, recent progress has been limited and largely concentrated in the Central American countries. Figure 1.19 ⊳ Population without clean cooking access by region, 2010-2024, and people gaining access by fuel, 2019-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. 58 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 While the number of people without access to clean cooking has been increasing in sub\u0002Saharan Africa, the underlying conditions for extending access have been gradually improving. Private sector businesses and financiers are participating more actively to facilitate access, and innovative technologies and business models are providing new and more cost-effective ways to broaden access. Clean cooking has also attracted recent political attention, with mentions in recent G7 and G20 communiqués and the launch of the 2024 Clean Cooking Declaration. In a rising number of countries, national strategies, targeted subsidies, tax and tariff reforms, and results-based financing are broadening access and lowering household costs. IEA tracking shows that more than half of the population without access live in countries that demonstrated progress on policies related to clean cooking in 2024. Most progress is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where seven-in-ten people without access live in countries that have recently introduced policies designed to increase access to clean cooking. Policy action is the main differentiator between the scenarios. In the STEPS, policy commitments are translated into accelerated progress, with the number of people without access decreasing to below 1.7 billion by 2030. The decrease is driven by continued progress in Asia and successful efforts to halt the rise in the number of people without access in sub\u0002Saharan Africa, which peaks in 2028. In the CPS, by contrast, constrained public budgets, higher borrowing costs and slower implementation limit the extent to which outcomes improve. The pace of access gains slows, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas, leaving around 200 million more people without access to clean cooking in 2030 than in the STEPS.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 59 1 The ACCESS shows what is possible by replicating the fastest historical rates of progress observed in comparable contexts. In the ACCESS, an average of around 130 million people gain the ability to use modern fuels for cooking each year up to 2040, putting the world on course for universal access to clean cooking around 2040 (Figure 1.20). The bulk of the acceleration occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, where success depends on a concentrated scale\u0002up of national, multilateral and private finance. Average annual investment needs for clean cooking are around USD 4 billion to 2040, with funding shifting from developing Asia, 80% of investment today, to sub-Saharan Africa, two-thirds of investment between 2035 and 2040. The make-up of financing evolves, with debt finance up from 35% today to nearly 60%. While the private sector provides the majority of capital, this is anchored in the ACCESS by public and concessional capital, particularly in less mature markets and lower income communities. In the ACCESS, demand for modern cooking fuels increases 1.5-times from current level by 2040 in emerging market and developing economies. While this is a substantial shift – roughly equivalent to current total energy use in France – it accounts for a relatively small share of global energy demand growth. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) underpins 63% of new access, increasing its use in cooking to around 3.4 mb/d by 2040; electric cooking provides access to 18% of the population and adds about 120 TWh; bioethanol supports access for 4% and use rises to roughly 6.5 billion litres; and the use of biogas and modern solid biomass also expands. In sub-Saharan Africa, the transition to modern cooking fuels has a particularly pronounced impact, reshaping regional energy consumption patterns. 1.6.2 Electricity access Progress on electricity access has been remarkable in recent decades. Since 2000, the number of people without electricity has fallen by almost a billion, and 40 countries have reached near-universal access (Figure 1.21). Aftersetbacks related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global energy crisis, the global trend is once again downward, but the pace of progress remains well below that achieved before the pandemic. In 2024, the number of people without access fell by 11 million, which is less than the average 65 million annual reductions seen between 2010 and 2019. Developing countries in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, which have driven most of the gains over the past two decades, are nearing universal access. As their contribution to global progress diminishes, attention is increasingly shifting to Africa, where 80% of the population still without access lives. In sub-Saharan Africa, the pace of electrification has also slowed. High levels of debt in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and the global energy crisis, combined with cuts in international aid, continue to weigh heavily on progress. In 2024, 27 countries made less progress on electrification than on average during the 2015–2019 period. New electrification policies and investment plans contribute to an improving outlook. Based on the IEA detailed tracking of energy access policies, around 60% of people without access live in countries that introduced new electricity access measures in 2024 and early 2025. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 60 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 These include tax and consumer incentives, electrification programmes, national strategies and other targeted actions. Such domestic initiatives are being reinforced by international efforts, including those made under South Africa’s G20 Presidency and Mission 300, and may be further strengthened by the focus on electricity and clean cooking access at the COP30 meeting that will take place in Brazil in November 2025. Figure 1.21 ⊳ Population without electricity access, 2010-2025e, and average residential electricity consumption per capita with access, 2000-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Developing Asia is approaching universal electricity access and electricity use is rising, while progress in sub-Saharan Africa is stagnating and household consumption is falling Note: 2025e = estimated values for 2025. On the basis of current trends, around 710 million people are projected to remain without access to electricity in 2030, and 650 million in 2050. Recent policy momentum improves the outlook somewhat: in the STEPS, the number of people without electricity falls by an additional 70 million in 2030 and 140 million in 2050 compared with the CPS. However, the progress made in the STEPS remains insufficient to achieve universal access by 2030 or even by mid-century. By replicating the fastest electrification progress achieved, universal access to electricity could be reached within just a decade. The ACCESS sees an average of 80 million people gain access to electricity each year to 2035, with rapid parallel deployment of grids, mini-grids and stand-alone systems (Figure 1.22). By 2040, the additional electricity demand from households gaining access in the ACCESS scenario reaches 270 TWh – roughly equivalent to electricity consumption in Italy today. The impact is particularly pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa, where new access accounts for around 45% of additional electricity demand to 2040, compared with 15% in developing Asia and 6% in other regions. 500 1 000 1 500 2010 2015 2020 2025e Sub-Saharan Africa Developing Asia Rest of world Population without access Million people 200 400 600 2000 2010 2020 2024 Residential electricity consumption per person with access kWh per capita Indonesia India Sub-Saharan Africa IEA.

Developing Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean approach universal access in the STEPS, while sub-Saharan Africa still faces a large gap Note: LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; ACCESS = Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario. The ACCESS outlook depends on around USD 250 billion of investment by 2035 to fund capital expenditure, including the cost of installing grid or mini-grid lines and equipment costs for decentralised solutions. This translates to around USD 23 billion of spending per year, which represents a sizeable portion of expected power sector investment outlays in the coming years, and would mean a sevenfold increase in the level of financing commitments directed to electricity access today. Mobilising more private finance is essential to expand electricity access at this pace, with several new financing solutions showing promise: these include off-balance sheet financing for stand-alone systems, and the use of local currency guarantees and green bonds for mini-grids. For smaller scale projects and harder-to-reach communities, private finance will rely on concessional and public finance to de-risk projects and ensure power is affordable for consumers. 1.7 How are critical minerals and other emerging issues changing the energy security landscape? In recent years, the global geopolitical landscape has been marked by more fragility and rising tensions. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and instability in the Middle East, concerns about the security and affordability of energy supply have deepened, prompting countries to prioritise security considerations in policy and investment decisions. Many countries are turning to more diversified or home-grown energy sources to reduce exposure to geopolitical 25% 50% 75% 100% 2000 2024 2040 STEPS ACCESS Electricity access rates Developing Asia LAC Sub-saharan Africa 1% 2% 3% 4% SSA Developing Asia LAC Average annual rates of progress 2019-2024 2024-2040: STEPS ACCESS IEA. CC BY 4.0. 62 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 risk. At the same time, energy and material exports are increasingly being used as instruments of foreign policy. Alongside the expansion of global trade, there has been a notable rise in the use of trade measures as geopolitical tools, including restrictions on materials and access to technologies. Traditionally, energy security focused on ensuring the adequacy of supply, but diversity, flexibility and resilience are emerging as the new watchwordsin today’s fragile environment. The focus of electricity policy is shifting from securing investment in generation capacity to mobilising investment in system flexibility that can balance increasingly volatile demand and supply. Rising risks of disruption from geopolitical tensions and extreme weather have pushed the resilience and diversity of supply sources higher up the policy agenda. At the same time, the scope of energy security has broadened as new risk factors come into play. 1.7.1 Critical minerals and energy technology supply chains The coming Age of Electricity is creating new dependencies that broaden the scope and complexity of the energy security landscape. Critical minerals, which underpin a wide range of energy and industrial technologies, are a prime example of these new hazards. These minerals are vital for power grids, batteries and EVs, but they also play a crucial role in AI chips, jet engines, defence systems and other strategic industries. This makes them central not only to energy security but also to broader economic resilience. These minerals are not directly used to run cars or heat homes, so supply shortages do not have the same immediate impacts as those for fuels like oil and natural gas. Yet disruptions to their supply can still cripple key manufacturing industries, with far-reaching consequences for economies and jobs. Diversification is central to energy security, yet the production, refining and processing of critical minerals is becoming increasingly concentrated in a few countries, heightening vulnerability to shocks and disruptions. Between 2020 and 2024, most of the growth in refined production of key energy minerals came from the leading suppliers. As a result, geographic concentration in refining increased for nearly all key energy minerals, and particularly for nickel and cobalt. The average market share of the top-three refining nations of key energy minerals rose from around 82% in 2020 to 86% in 2024. Our detailed analysis of announced projects suggests that progress towards more diversified refining supply chains is set to be slow. By 2035, the average share of the top-three refined material suppliers is projected to decline only slightly to 82%, effectively returning to the concentration levels seen in 2020. In the CPS, supply concentration is likely to remain higher than in the STEPS: it projects weaker demand, which translates into lower prices that favour incumbent producers sitting at the lower end of the cost curve. In the NZE Scenario, supply concentration challenges are compounded by volume risks as demand increases at a much faster pace. Supply concentration is similarly stark across energy technology supply chains. In solar PV, China holds over 80% of global manufacturing capacity at every stage of the supply chain. In IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 63 1 wind power, it accounts for nearly 80% of nacelle production and over 70% of blade manufacturing. China’s dominance is even stronger in batteries, where it commands at least 85% of capacity across the value chain and over 95% in the case of anodes. This high market concentration creates a risk of major supply shortfalls if production from the largest supplier is disrupted by extreme weather, technical failures or trade restrictions. For battery metals and rare earths, when the supply and demand of the largest producer are excluded, supplies outside the leading producer meet on average only half of the remaining demand in 2035. Expanding the scope of analysis to a wider set of 20 energy-related strategic minerals reveals further vulnerabilities, stemming from high supply concentration, price volatility and by-product dependence (IEA, 2025c). A key point from this analysis is that China is the dominant refiner for 19 of the 20 minerals analysed, holding an average market share of around 70% (Figure 1.23). Figure 1.23 ⊳ Top refiner share of selected energy-related strategic minerals by country IEA. CC BY 4.0. China is the leading producer for nearly all of the 20 energy-related strategic minerals analysed, with an average market share of around 70% Note: Values refer primarily to 2024, or to the latest year for which data are available in certain cases. Source: IEA (2025c). With a recent proliferation of export controls on key materials and technologies, these supply risks are no longer just a theoretical concern. As of October 2025, more than half of these 20 strategic minerals are subject to some form of export controls. A notable development came in April 2025, when the Chinese government introduced export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements, along with their related compounds, metals and 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Gallium Graphite Manganese Rare earths Silicon Molybdenum Cobalt Tellurium Antimony Germanium Indium Lithium Titanium Vanadium Tantalum Tungsten Copper Nickel Chromium Zirconium China Indonesia IEA. CC BY 4.0. 64 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 magnets. As export volumes fell sharply, many automotive manufacturers in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere struggled to secure rare earth magnets, and some were forced to cut utilisation rates or even temporarily shut down factories. In October 2025, these export controls were tightened to include parts, components and assemblies produced using Chinese materials or technologies. While the market sizes for these strategic minerals are relatively small compared with bulk materials, disruptions in their supply can nevertheless have outsized economic impacts. For example, a 10% disruption in rare earth magnet exports could affect the production of 6.2 million conventional cars, or almost 1 million industrial motors, or 230 000 civilian aircraft, or the construction of over 650 hyper-scale AI data centres. Determined action is required in the near term to enhance preparedness against potential disruptions, and over the longer term to diversify supply chains. 1.7.2 Electricity security As the share of electricity in the global energy mix rises across all IEA scenarios, the need to ensure the resilience and security of power systems is moving to the top of the energy policy agenda. Its growing importance as a major energy carrier means that the economic cost of power outages and system failures is rising sharply. Recent blackouts in Chile and the Iberian Peninsula illustrate how quickly supply interruptions can cascade through increasingly interconnected systems, affecting millions of households and businesses (see Chapter 8). Ensuring electricity security begins with maintaining adequate supply to meet rising and increasingly variable demand. Electrification, climate change and shifting consumption patterns are reshaping electricity demand profiles. In the STEPS, global peak electricity demand increases by about 40% between 2024 and 2035. The CPS sees similar growth in peak demand, with lower levels of electrification counterbalanced by slower efficiency improvements. In the NZE Scenario, peak demand increases even faster as electrification accelerates across sectors, particularly in industry and transport. However, improvements in cooling efficiency and the widespread adoption of heat pumps for space heating reduces the temperature sensitivity of electricity demand, enhancing its resilience to weather extremes. On the supply side, the rapid deployment of variable renewables introduces new operational challenges. Systems dominated by renewables must be able to meet demand when low wind and solar output coincides with periods of high demand. Periods of high renewables generation can also pose stability challenges as low system inertia increases the risk of frequency deviations. Flexibility, defined as the ability to balance the variability of demand and supply, has become a critical element of electricity security. Short-term flexibility requirements, currently around 10% of average demand in many systems, rise two- to seven-times by 2035 in the STEPS, outpacing electricity demand growth. The NZE Scenario projects a significantly higher need for short-term flexibility requirements, which rise two- to ten-times by 2035 to ensure system reliability amid the swift expansion of variable renewables and changing patterns of electricity demand (Figure 1.24). While dispatchable plants such natural gas, coal, IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 65 1 hydropower or nuclear plants remain essential, their role increasingly shifts from bulk generation towards ensuring secure capacity and flexibility. Batteries and demand response are set to become major contributors to system reliability, supplying most of the needed short-term flexibility by 2035. In 2024, global battery storage additions reached 77 GW thanks to strong policy support and declining technology costs. Total installed battery capacity reaches nearly 1 700 GW by 2035 in the STEPS, around 1 400 GW in the CPS, and close to 2 900 GW in the NZE Scenario. Figure 1.24 ⊳ Short-term flexibility needs and peak electricity demand by scenario, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Both short-term flexibility needs and peak demand rise through to 2035; higher efficiency makes demand more resilient to extreme weather in the NZE Scenario Notes: GW = gigawatt. STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; Adv. Economies = advanced economies; EMDE excl. China = emerging market and developing economies excluding China. Peak demand does not include the activation of demand response. There are other important facets of electricity security as well. In many regions, seasonal flexibility needs grow faster than overall electricity demand by 2035 in the STEPS, and even more in the NZE Scenario, as a result of the increasing requirement to manage prolonged periods of low renewables output or temperature-driven demand changes. Ageing transmission and distribution networks pose increasing reliability risks, calling for targeted modernisation and digitalisation. Traditional market designs focused on ensuring sufficient generation capacity need to value flexibility, ancillary services and resilience, and market frameworks need to include incentives that reward demand response, smart infrastructure, and innovative technologies that facilitate efficient and secure management of controllable loads. 600 1 200 1 800 2 400 Adv.

CC BY 4.0. 66 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 1.7.3 Infrastructure resilience The resilience of energy infrastructure in the face of natural hazards is becoming increasingly important. These hazards include geophysical risks such as earthquakes and tsunamis as well as extreme weather and related events such as storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and wildfires. Extreme weather events are becoming more consequential, undermining the reliability of energy systems through outages and increasing delivery costs to consumers through losses, damages and higher insurance premiums. A new IEA dataset shows that extreme weather events caused nearly 300 disruptions of critical energy infrastructure in 2023. Power lines proved most vulnerable, with damages to transmission and distribution grids accounting for about 85% of these incidents (Figure 1.25). Other notable impacts include: drought-related water scarcity that constrain hydropower output; wildfires that force utilities to de-energise power lines; and hailstorms that damage solar PV facilities. Rising electrification and digitalisation of economic activity means that power outages carry much more significant economic costs. Figure 1.25 ⊳ Impacts of extreme weather events in 2023, and additional power capacity needed from extreme heat in the STEPS, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Extreme weather caused power outages in more than 200 million households in 2023, additional capacity will be needed to compensate for extreme weather impacts Notes: GW = gigawatt; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. The year 2023 provides a snapshot of the impacts of extreme weather events on energy infrastructure. It does not necessarily represent an average weather year, as weather is variable. Outage numbers are likely underestimated due to variability of reporting by region. Events are recorded as a single type, which consolidates compound effects such as storms leading to floods. “Extreme heat” is the difference between the median and the top-three peak demand values across 30 years of weather data (see Chapter 5, section 5.2.4). Recent trends show that some extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense. Extreme heat is a case in point.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 67 1 as the use of air conditioners increases, and this particularly affects peak demand. In the STEPS, income-driven growth in the use of air conditioning raises peak demand by over 330 GW by 2035 compared to today, and increasing use driven by long-term temperature rise adds another 170 GW. In very hot years, extreme peak temperatures could push demand up by an additional 260 GW. These cumulative increases would raise peak demand by over 15% by 2035 over today’s level. The impacts are even more significant in the CPS, where less efficient air conditioning units and higher extreme temperatures amplify peak demand pressures. These pressures can be compounded by the effects of extreme weather on power infrastructure, for example when droughts reduce hydropower output or when there are long periods of low wind power output. High temperatures can also lower generation capacity at thermal plants due to constraints on the discharge of water used for cooling, equipment stress and physical decreases in production efficiency. When such capacity reductions coincide with surging demand from extreme heat, we estimate that the combined effect could add an additional 6% to projected peak demand by 2035 in both the CPS and the STEPS. This is equivalent to around one-half to one-third of typical reserve margins, highlighting the importance of considering extreme high temperatures during capacity adequacy planning. 1.7.4 Oil and gas supply chains The importance of addressing emerging vulnerabilities does not imply any lessening of the need for vigilance when it comes to traditional oil and gas security. Concerns about tightness in fossil fuel markets are beginning to ease, but shifting geopolitical dynamics and persistent risks to oil and gas supply chains could quickly erode existing buffers and alter market balances. For example, accelerating decline rates in existing oil and gas fields pose major supply risks if adequate investment is not maintained. IEA analysis of around 15 000 fields worldwide shows that natural decline rates are becoming steeper (IEA, 2025d). If all capital investment in current oil and gas production were to cease immediately, global oil supply would fall by around 5.5 mb/d each year and natural gas output by 270 bcm. In 2010, these figures were 3.9 mb/d and 180 bcm respectively. Nearly 90% of upstream investment today is directed to offsetting declines rather than expanding capacity. Both the CPS and the STEPS see rising import dependence in major consuming regions, particularly Asia and Europe. Emerging market and developing economies in Asia, including China, are the destination for around 60% of the oil and gas exported worldwide in 2035 in both scenarios. Asia’s share of global oil imports increases in the STEPS from just over 70% today to 80% by 2050 (Figure 1.26). The Middle East remains the dominant oil exporter, sending out three-times more oil than the next-largest exporter in 2035. Oil and gas trade flows become increasingly dominated by exports from the Middle East to Asia. This increases the sector’s vulnerability to disruptions at key maritime chokepoints, including the Strait of Hormuz, the Strait of Malacca, the Suez Canal and Red Sea, and the Panama Canal, and at major ports in key exporting and importing regions. Oil and gas exports are also vulnerable IEA. CC BY 4.0. 68 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 to weather-related disruption. By 2035, nearly 30% of LNG passes through the US Gulf Coast, an area historically exposed to hurricane-related disruptions. Figure 1.26 ⊳ Oil export and import share by region in the STEPS, 2020-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Oil trade flows are becoming increasingly concentrated between the Middle East and Asia, heightening exposure to disruptions at major maritime chokepoints and key ports Note: C & S America = Central and South America; Other APAC = Other Asia Pacific. 1.8 Where will all the LNG go? Since 2015, consumption of LNG has increased twice as fast as that of natural gas, and LNG overtook large-scale pipelines in 2023 as the predominant way of trading gas over long distances. The rise of LNG has reshaped global gas trade, opening new markets, upending established trade patterns, reconfiguring geopolitics and bolstering energy security for those countries able to afford it. LNG supply has tended to expand in cycles. After a relatively muted period of export capacity growth between 2020 and 2024, the period from 2025 to 2030 is set to see an unprecedented 300 bcm of new LNG export capacity come online (Figure 1.27),2 which will lead to a 50% increase in available global LNG supply. Based on projects currently under construction, more than half of the capacity is being built in the United States, and a further 25% in Qatar. Unlike previous waves of capacity growth, around three-quarters of the new 2 This translates into a 265 bcm increase in available LNG capacity, which takes into account maintenance work, unplanned outages and issues at upstream facilities, as well as 10 bcm of existing capacity that is set to shut by 2030.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 69 1 supply is flexible, either as uncontracted gas that can be sold on the spot market or under a long-term contract with flexible destination clauses. The key questions, therefore, are in which markets, at what price and under what conditions this rising tide of LNG supply can be absorbed. Figure 1.27 ⊳ LNG capacity under development by supplying country, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. United States has driven global liquefaction capacity growth for the past decade and it is set to expand its capacity by a further 160 bcm to 2035 Note: bcm = billion cubic metres. 1.8.1 Global LNG outlook to 2035 In the CPS, global LNG demand increases by 260 bcm between 2024 and 2030 (Figure 1.28), absorbing the increase in available LNG capacity over this period. Gas prices reflect this demand pull, and are close to the long-run marginal cost of delivering LNG, which includes the full capital costs associated with developing liquefaction, shipping and regasification. Large, well-established importers such as China, Europe and Japan absorb around half of the increase in LNG supply to 2030. There are also large increases in LNG demand in emerging market and developing economies in Asia, but high gas prices limit the degree of uptake of natural gas in the CPS in lower income and more price-sensitive countries. By 2035, around 20 bcm per year of LNG export capacity is required above what is currently existing and under development. In the STEPS, LNG demand increases by 200 bcm between 2024 and 2030. This is smaller than the change in available LNG export capacity, and puts downward pressure on LNG prices, bringing them close to short-run marginal costs. Stronger renewables growth, increased electrification, and more rapid efficiency gains in the STEPS lead to more LNG being crowded 100 200 300 2010-2014 2015-2019 2020-2024 2025-2030 2031-2035 Other Canada Australia Qatar United States bcm IEA.

This frees up relatively low-cost LNG for price-sensitive consumers in other markets, notably in India and other parts of South and Southeast Asia, but – given their stated policy settings and continued efforts to electrify and deploy renewables – the increase in demand from these consumers is not sufficient to absorb all of the remaining wave of new LNG supply. This results in an overhang of available LNG capacity of around 65 bcm in 2030. The surplus is gradually worked off by 2035. Figure 1.28 ⊳ Existing and under construction available LNG export capacity and LNG trade by scenario to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The large upcoming wave of additional LNG export capacity is fully absorbed in the CPS but results in well-supplied global gas markets in the STEPS through to 2035 Note: CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. In the NZE Scenario, the sharp decrease in global natural gas demand means that many of the LNG projects currently under construction are no longer necessary. If they were to go ahead, aggregate capacity utilisation would fall to 75% in 2030 and 50% in 2035, and several plants that found themselves unable to compete in a supply glut would be likely to end up closing or being repurposed to trade hydrogen-based fuels such as ammonia or methanol. 1.8.2 Advanced economies The European Union vastly increased its LNG imports after dramatic cuts to Russian pipeline deliveries in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Acutely aware of dependence on imported fossil fuels as a strategic vulnerability, the European Union has made clear that its efforts to reach net zero emissions are driven by security concerns as well as concerns about climate change. 300 600 900 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 bcm Existing LNG capacity STEPS CPS Under construction NZE IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 71 1 Natural gas demand in the European Union peaked in 2010, and it fell by 20% between 2021 and 2024. Demand is set to fall further, but LNG imports expand in both the CPS and the STEPS to 2035 as domestic production dwindles, and pipeline imports continue to decline. In the CPS, where the transition to low-emissions energy sources is slower than in the STEPS, gas demand falls by 35 bcm between 2024 and 2035, and LNG imports increase by 80 bcm. In the STEPS, demand falls by 75 bcm to 2035 as the European Union continues to electrify light industry and heating, and the increase in LNG imports is 35 bcm. Gas will nevertheless remain essential to EU energy security in both the CPS and the STEPS in the years ahead, providing power system stability and significant seasonal storage capabilities (Figure 1.29). Figure 1.29 ⊳ Change in LNG demand in the European Union and Asia by scenario, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Strong demand from established importers raises prices in the CPS, moderating growth elsewhere; in the STEPS, ample supply and low prices boost LNG in developing Asia Japan and Korea are nearly fully dependent on imported LNG to meet domestic gas demand. In Japan, the prospects for additional LNG use depend to a large extent on nuclear restarts: every 1 GW of capacity brought back online would reduce LNG demand by around 1-1.5 bcm. In the CPS, LNG imports in Japan in 2035 reach around 100 bcm, 7% higher than 2024 levels; in the STEPS, there is a slight reduction in LNG imports. In Korea, LNG imports in the CPS are flat to 2035; in the STEPS, expanding use of renewables slightly lowers gas use in the power sector and offsets modest industrial gas demand growth, and LNG falls slightly to 2035. 1.8.3 Emerging market and developing economies in Asia Since 2015, around 35% of global LNG supply growth has been absorbed by China, even though natural gas accounts for a relatively small share of its overall energy mix. This reflects significant gas infrastructure expansion, an opening of the domestic market, and broad\u0002based growth in demand. - 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 European Union China Japan and Korea Southeast Asia India Other CPS STEPS bcm 2024-2035 developing Asia IEA. CC BY 4.0. 72 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 China is a wild card for global LNG. Its LNG imports are set to be lower in 2025 than in recent years due to stronger domestic production, increased imports of pipeline gas from Russia, and muted gas demand growth. The deepening energy relationship between China and Russia, including the prospect of a second Power of Siberia pipeline, raises questions about China’s long-term appetite for additional LNG volumes. A key engine of gas demand growth in China in recent years has been light industry, which is projected to continue to electrify in the STEPS. Gas has also been used to meet rising power demand, but its share of the generation mix has remained around 3% since 2019, while the solar share has risen from 3% in 2019 to 8% in 2024. In the STEPS, LNG demand in China increases from 110 bcm in 2024 to 165 bcm in 2035. LNG demand in the CPS in 2035 is higher at 180 bcm, due to slower electrification and renewables growth. Fast-growing emerging market and developing countries in Asia offer another major opportunity for future LNG demand growth. This diverse group of countries includes: established importers like Singapore; major current LNG producers such as Indonesia and Malaysia; and relative newcomers to the business of importing LNG such as Viet Nam and the Philippines. In India, LNG has been growing in recent years, driven by opportunistic buyers and strong potential growth in demand, especially in industry. In countries with mature domestic gas production, such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, LNG is a logical replacement for declining domestic gas. In many of these countries, natural gas is viewed as a cleaner and more convenient alternative to coal and heavy fuel oil, and there are policies targeting improved air quality or programmes to expand gas infrastructure (Box 1.5). The critical variable affecting the scale of demand growth is price. In the STEPS, weighted average gas import prices in emerging market and developing countries in Asia are around USD 7.5 per million British thermal units (MBtu) in the 2030-2035 period, around 40% lower than today. This underpins significant LNG demand growth, especially in energy-hungry price-sensitive markets: in Southeast Asia LNG imports quadruple by 2035, and in India they triple. However, this growth depends on overcoming infrastructure constraints: in Southeast Asia, several regasification projects remain in the planning stages; in India, downstream infrastructure is insufficient to fully utilise some of its LNG terminals. Even at prices near to the short-run marginal cost of supply, LNG remains a premium fuel in a number of markets in Asia. Abundant supply may offer these countries significant optionality for security of supply reasons, and may help them to manage periods of system stress, but the economics of LNG make it difficult to penetrate these markets as a baseload fuel in the long run. 1.8.4 Implications for exporters The period of LNG surplus in the STEPS makes it difficult for some exporters to fully recover their long-run marginal cost of supply, creating risks that project sponsors write off the value of the assets. The United States, as the most flexible supplier, sees the highest level of exposure to reduced rates of utilisation. This risk is borne primarily by those with equity or IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 73 1 trading positions in LNG supply in the United States, such as portfolio players, rather than by LNG liquefaction terminal owners, who primarily sell export capacity at terminals, whether it is used or not. Suppliers selling LNG cargoes on a long-term take-or-pay basis could also pass much of the volume and price risk to off-takers. However, the potential for LNG surpluses is not just a risk in the United States. The lower rates of LNG capacity utilisation in the STEPS become visible in exporters around the world as volume flexibility in existing contracts is fully exercised, legacy contracts are not renewed, and older plants with relatively high operating costs undergo prolonged maintenance or refurbishment. Box 1.5 ⊳ Can coal-to-gas switching absorb the wave of new LNG? A central argument made by those that maintain the coming wave of LNG supply can be fully absorbed is that cheap gas could displace coal, especially in emerging market and developing economiesin Asia. The potential is indeed significant: global LNG supply today is equivalent to just eight weeks of coal use in China and India alone. Since 2010, around 30% of the 380 bcm of natural gas demand growth in emerging market and developing economies in Asia has come from coal-to-gas switching, and virtually all of this happened in China. In the STEPS, softer near-term market balances encourage additional switching of around 40 bcm between 2024 and 2030, primarily in China as well as other coal-rich price-sensitive markets in Asia. There is significant additional scope for coal-to-gas switching in 2030, although several factors limit this potential from being fully realised. For example, the role of coal in power generation is often shielded from market competition, with coal-fired plants operating in regulated markets or under long-term contracts guaranteeing minimum output (IEA, 2022). In addition, many industrial facilities and coal plants rely on cheap domestic coal; in practice the scope for switching using LNG is limited to plants using imported coal. There are also infrastructure and locational constraints, such as the capacity of electricity or gas grids to support near-term switching. Taking these factors into account, we estimate nearly 400 bcm of coal-to-gas switching potential in the power and industry sectors is technically feasible beyond what occurs in the STEPS (Figure 1.30). This is the short-term switching potential, i.e. electricity generation or industrial output that can switch from coal-fired units to gas-fired units based on facilities and infrastructure that exist in 2030. If delivered LNG prices were to fall to USD 5/MBtu, this would unlock an additional 100 bcm of short term coal-to gas switching, mainly in China’s power sector. Further switching could occur if prices were to remain at this level for an extended period as this may encourage long-term decisions to replace existing or planned coal units with gas units instead, for example in power, steel or chemicals. However, the long-run marginal cost of global LNG supply is well above USD 5/MBtu and so it is unlikely that prices could remain around this level for a prolonged period. IEA.

Recent years have seen substantial investment in clean energy technology manufacturing. This has led to significant surplus capacity in the manufacturing of some key technologies (Figure 1.31). Global manufacturing capacity for PV modules was two-times higher than actual production in 2024, with a significant share of this production going into inventories; and three-times higher for battery cells. One of the key questions facing this Outlook is what happens to this surplus capacity in the context of increasing trade tensions, substantial pressure on technology prices, and falling profit margins for some technology producers. These themes and others impacting the future of clean energy technology manufacturing and trade will be explored in more detail in the forthcoming edition of Energy Technology Perspectives. Much of this surplus capacity is in China. Since the largest outlet for its manufacturing capacity is its own huge domestic market, what happens in that market has a critical bearing on whether this capacity will be used. In recent years, the rapid growth of renewables deployment, EV sales and battery storage installations in China has been partly driven by aggressive pricing and competition as its producers seek market share. Curtailment rates of wind and solar have ticked up recently, and China raised its wind and solar PV curtailment 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 100 200 300 400 Potential gas switch (bcm) Break-even gas price (USD per MBtu, 2024 MER) China India Southeast Asia Other developing Asia China India Southeast Asia Other developing Asia Power Industry IEA.

On the other hand, EV sales continue to increase and are spreading to segments beyond passenger cars, such as medium and heavy-duty trucks.

Production used to supply inventories is only included for solar PV. Source: Energy Technology Perspectives, a forthcoming IEA publication, includes information on the data sources used in IEA analysis of clean energy technology supply chains. Both the STEPS and CPS see continued momentum behind clean energy technology deployment in China driven by economic competitiveness, manufacturing momentum and policy support. Electric cars account for more than 90% of passenger car sales in China in both the CPS and the STEPS by 2035, up from around 50% in 2024; electric freight truck sales account for more than 50% of sales by the same year, up from just over 20% of the market in the first-half of 2025. In 2024, wind and solar PV accounted for 18% of electricity generation in China. In the STEPS, their combined share of total generation reaches roughly 50% by 2035. In the CPS, it is around five percentage points lower because less capacity is added and curtailment rates are higher in this scenario. 500 1 000 1 500 Capacity Production Solar PV modules (GW) 100 200 300 Capacity Production Wind power nacelles (GW) 1 200 2 400 3 600 Capacity Production Battery cells (GWh) 10 20 30 Capacity Production China North America Europe Rest of world Electric cars (Million units) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 76 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 China’s exports of clean energy technologies have increased by around four-times since 2019 and now account for around 5% of China’s total goods exports. In the first-half of 2025, around two-thirds of these exports by value went to advanced economies and around one\u0002third to emerging market and developing economies (Figure 1.32). This mix looks somewhat different by technology. Emerging market and developing economies accounted for over half of China’s exports of solar PV equipment in 2025, but only one-quarter of battery exports. Exports by nominal value underplay the continuing growth in the scale of China’s clean energy technology exports, as many of these technologies have experienced substantial price deflation in recent years.

These exports have the potential to bring about significant changes in the energy sectors of importing countries.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 77 1 manufactured low-cost electric cars are seeing rapid sales growth in some other emerging market and developing economies, and EV sales shares are now larger than in advanced economies in some cases (IEA, 2025e). The dominance of China in global clean energy technology manufacturing and its surging exports have triggered concerns among a number of countries. China’s manufactured goods surplus increased from around USD 1 trillion in 2019 to around USD 2 trillion in 2024, two\u0002times faster than the rate from 2010 to 2019. Its extensive industrial policies, which are opaque and difficult to quantify, have been estimated to cost around 2-4% of GDP: this is far more than in advanced economies (IMF, 2025). A highly competitive market, high rates of innovation, and extensive government support enable China to produce energy technologies at very low cost. However, in some cases, such as solar PV panels, current low prices are unsustainable, and companies are losing money (IEA, 2025f). Countries have responded by raising trade barriers, including targeting energy technologies such as EVs and solar PV. In response, Chinese companies have pledged around USD 230 billion in clean energy-related manufacturing investments overseas. China has also sought – thus far unsuccessfully – to promote consolidation in some of its clean energy technology manufacturing sectors. Energy transitions hinge on sound domestic policy frameworks. For example, large-scale imports of solar PV in some cases are driven by defections from a dysfunctional central grid. Distributed solar PV can bring substantial benefits: it can reduce consumer costs, cut fuel import bills, and provide a first rung of energy access for underserved communities. However, distributed generation can also accelerate revenue losses for distribution companies. A fragmented electricity sector, with chronically weak distribution companies, is unlikely to provide a lasting basis for economic growth. In the case of EVs, infrastructure provision is essential to support high and expanding sales levels, and this requires effective policy and planning. Key questions for the outlook therefore include whether international markets remain open to clean energy technology trade and investment, and whether domestic policy frameworks can learn and adapt to support energy transitions driven by disruptive, commercially available technologies. In the CPS, these obstacles to the diffusion of new technologies loom large, creating significant pressure on new energy industries to consolidate in order to lift utilisation rates and ensure profitability. In the STEPS, these constraints are less binding, and global deployment trends allow for more diversified clean technology value chains to emerge over time. However, only in more rapid energy transition outlookslike the NZE Scenario does the world fully utilise today’s manufacturing capacity and then expand it. Wind and solar PV show how the dynamics play out in the CPS and the STEPS. Together they met around one-fifth of electricity generation in advanced economies in 2024. In the CPS, this rises to around one-third by 2035, building on policy support and market competitiveness in many of these countries (Figure 1.33). Faster transitions in the STEPS see the share rise to two-fifths by 2035. In China, wind and solar PV reach around 45% of total generation by 2035 but are held back from increasing further by rising curtailment rates and IEA. CC BY 4.0. 78 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 challenges of grid integration. In the STEPS, market reforms and additional investment in grids, flexibility and storage see this share rise to nearly 50%, leading to substantial declines in coal generation. In emerging market and developing economies other than China, there is a substantial rise in the share of wind and solar PV in both the CPS and the STEPS, although it is more pronounced in the STEPS. Figure 1.33 ⊳ Wind and solar PV in total generation and market share of EVs in car sales by region and scenario, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Clean energy deployment expands in all scenarios, but is held back by weaker policy frameworks and growing system integration challenges in the CPS Note: CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. EVs are also important in this context. They are highly competitive in the Chinese market, and achieve high levels of penetration in 2035 in both the STEPS and the CPS. In other emerging market and developing economies, EV sales shares essentially flatline in the CPS as many of them lack explicit, longer term supportive policies. In advanced economies, the STEPS sees rapid growth of EV sales, with the sales share increasing from around 15% today to around 55% in 2035; in the CPS, it reaches 45%. 1.10 Where are the gaps in global energy investment? Energy investment worldwide exceeded USD 3.2 trillion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 3.3 trillion in 2025 (IEA, 2025g). The future trajectory for energy investment varies by scenario. In the CPS, average annual energy investment between 2025 and 2035 remains similar to 2024 levels; in the STEPS, it reaches over USD 3.4 trillion; in the NZE Scenario, it reaches nearly USD 4.8 trillion. In this section, we analyse what these energy investment projections tell us about potential gaps and risks. 25% 50% 2024 CPS STEPS Advanced economies China EMDE excluding China Wind and solar PV 2035 50% 100% 2024 CPS STEPS EVs 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 79 1 1.10.1 By fuel and technology Our analysis of current energy investment flows and future needs by fuel and technology raises three main concerns. First is energy efficiency. The rate at which global energy efficiency is improving, as measured by the energy intensity of global GDP, slowed in recent years. There are several reasons including significant gaps in the coverage of efficiency standards and the lack of stringency in some of the standards that do exist. For example, around 40% of newly built floor area is not yet covered by efficiency requirements, and the regulations in place vary significantly among countries in their scope and stringency. Similarly, just three-out-of-five industrial electric motors in use globally are covered by minimum energy performance standards. While spending on end-use electrification is rising, notably for EVs, investment in technical efficiency improvements to help deliver more efficient housing stock or equipment has been flatter. Additional investment to help deliver such improvements could bring benefits for energy security, cut energy bills and reduce the environmental impact of energy use. The second concern relates to grids and other investment in electricity security. Overall spending in the power sector has surged in recent years: investment in today’s power sector now accounts for over 40% of energy sector spending, and this level rises to over 50% when investment in end-use electrification is included. However, the rise in investment has been uneven. Annual investment in power generation increased from around USD 600 billion in 2015 to over USD 1 trillion today, led by a massive expansion in spending on solar PV. Spending on grids has risen much more gradually to around USD 400 billion. Ten years ago, for every dollar spent on generation, around USD 0.60 was spent on transmission and distribution networks. The comparable figure today is around USD 0.40. Grid investment is not just a question of money, important as that is. Significant practical impediments to getting grid-related projects off the ground include slow permitting processes and tight supply chains for transformers, cables and other components. Around 1 700 GW of renewable energy projects at advanced stages of development are being held up today because grid connections are not available. Much more needs to be done to ensure that these and other projects can proceed quickly. Adequate investment in networks also needs to be accompanied by spending on dispatchable sources of generation and on other sources of power system flexibility and stability, including storage and demand-side response measures. Third is the concern more broadly for investment in support of energy transitions. Investment that tackles global emissions typically involves higher upfront costs that are offset over time by much lower operating expenditures, mainly through lower fuel costs. This is a major reason why the investment levels in the NZE Scenario are higher than in the exploratory scenarios (Figure 1.34). The largest gaps over the next ten years are for energy efficiency and end-use electrification, where annual investment more than doubles from current levels to reach USD 1.7 trillion on average between 2025 and 2035 in the NZE Scenario. Compared with the CPS and the STEPS, there are also significant increases in the NZE Scenario for annual investment in renewable power and low-emissions fuels. All scenarios see a continued rise in spending on nuclear power. IEA.

CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. In other sectors the gaps between current investment levels and the scenario projections are less pronounced. Recent average spending of about USD 825 billion on oil and gas supply is only marginally below the annual investment needs in the CPS, USD 890 billion, and slightly above what is needed in the STEPS, USD 800 billion, over the next decade. Much less is required in the NZE Scenario. In all scenarios, the vast majority of upstream spending on oil and gas is to offset declines in production from existing fields. All scenarios see a continued need for mining operations, including a rising need for critical minerals. In the NZE Scenario, overall extractive operations fall dramatically, despite the increased call for battery metals, copper and rare earth elements for a more electrified and renewables-rich system (Box 1.6). 200 400 600 800 2022-2024 CPS STEPS NZE Billion USD (2024, MER) Supply Power End-use Renewables Grids and storage Nuclear Efficiency Electrification Midstream oil and gas 2025-2035 Upstream oil and gas Coal Low-emissions fuels Fossil fuels 1 265 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 81 1 Box 1.6 ⊳ How much material is extracted in our scenarios? The global energy system requires the extraction of vast quantities of materials from fossil fuels to critical minerals. The total weight of useful products for the energy system was around 17 billion tonnes in 2024. Even larger quantities of material are extracted to deliver these useful products (Figure 1.35). Operators must remove and handle material such as waste rock, drilling cuttings, slag, water and sludge. On average, around 7 tonnes of material, mostly rock and water, are extracted for every tonne of coal produced. For every tonne of oil produced, nearly 6 tonnes of water and other residues are extracted. Critical minerals require far larger amounts of material to be processed: for typical ore grades, more than 100 tonnes of residue are extracted for every tonne of mineral produced. For example, ore grades are usually below 1% for copper, resulting in more than one hundred parts of material being extracted to obtain one part of copper. Much less material is usually involved in gas extraction, with less than 1 tonne of water and drilling cuttings extracted for each tonne of natural gas produced. Figure 1.35⊳ Raw material extraction of fossil fuels and critical minerals by scenario, 2000-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Despite the increase in critical mineral extraction, the total amount of raw material for the energy system declines in all scenarios Notes: CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Critical minerals include lithium, copper, nickel, cobalt, graphite and magnet rare earths. In total, we estimate that around 120 billion tonnes of raw materials related to fossil fuels and critical minerals were extracted from the earth in 2024, of which coal production accounted for more than half of the total. The weight of energy-related materials extracted falls slightly by 2035 in the CPS, mainly because of declines in coal mining. This reduction is more pronounced in the STEPS and even more so in the NZE Scenario, despite 40 80 120 2000 2010 2020 2024 Coal Oil Natural gas Critical minerals Billion tonnes CPS STEPS NZE 2035 2050 2035 2050 2035 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 82 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 an increase in extraction related to critical minerals. Less raw material extraction implies less land-use change and environmental degradation, lower energy use and a decrease in emissions and water use. 1.10.2 By country and region At a country and regional level, many of the most striking gaps in energy investment are in emerging market and developing economies, with the notable exception of China. As detailed in section 1.1.1, these are the economies that take over as the primary drivers of energy demand growth, with India and Indonesia in the lead. In many cases, however, these are also the economies that have faced difficulties to mobilise sufficient capital to meet their increasing needs for energy infrastructure. In Africa, energy investment today is around one\u0002third below where it was ten years ago because a large drop in spending on fossil fuel supply has only been partially offset by a rise in other areas. This is a particular concern given strong expected population growth in Africa and the large number of people that continue to lack access to electricity and clean cooking. How emerging market and developing economies meet their rising energy needs is a pivotal question for the energy outlook. Analysis and surveys conducted for the IEA Cost of Capital Observatory highlight some of the issues that can deter investment. A key issue is that the cost of capital for power generation projects in emerging market and developing economies is over twice as high as it is in advanced economies. This reflects higher real and perceived risks at the country, sectoral and project levels. A high cost of capital pushes up financing costs and makes it much more difficult to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, especially for relatively capital-intensive investment in clean technologies. Broad country-related risks and macroeconomic factors typically explain a large share of country-by-country variations in the cost of capital. For example, investors may have concerns about the rule of law and sanctity of contracts, or about currency fluctuations and convertibility. As the balance of capital spending on energy in emerging market and developing economies shifts from globally traded commodities such as oil towards projects that rely on domestically generated revenues, notably in the electricity sector, the quality and predictability of the business environment are likely to become even more important for investors. There are also risks that can be addressed directly by energy policy makers and regulators, notably regarding the reliability of payment, availability of transmission infrastructure and land, and how these issues are defined in contracts. A positive aspect of the Outlook is that, in our scenarios, most of the required investment in emerging market and developing economies over the next ten years is in mature technologies and in sectors with tried and tested policy formulas for success (Figure 1.36). Nonetheless, scaling up investment remains a major challenge, especially if national energy and sustainability objectives are to be met in full. Success will depend to a large extent on more private sector involvement; on well-co-ordinated, enhanced international financial and technical support; and on the creation of deeper domestic capital markets and financial systems in developing economies that can channel savings towards productive investments. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings 83 1 Figure 1.36 ⊳ Average annual energy investment by type, region and scenario, 2022-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Huge investment opportunities remain in emerging market and developing economies across all scenarios Note: MER = market exchange rate; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. In the NZE Scenario, for example, we estimate that international public finance of about USD 120 billion per year is needed to mobilise both domestic and international private capital. With development finance budgets falling, these limited resources must shift from providing direct funding at senior tranches towards riskier junior and first loss tranches. Where equity is in short supply, they also need to be used to provide more equity capital. To achieve mobilisation at scale, leverage ratios need to rise sharply. Every dollar of international public finance today mobilises USD 0.60 of private capital, and the aim should be to see that ratio rise to at least five to seven dollars. At a regional level, Africa needs to be a priority given the imbalances in current capital flows.

Electricity use expanded rapidly across a range of sectors. Deployment of renewable power generation again broke records in 2024, meeting more than 70% of the increase in electricity demand. Consumption of each of the fossil fuels rose. Global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached another all-time high. • The energy sector faces many uncertainties. The global economy is projected to grow at an average rate of 3% in the 2024-2030 period, but changes in the global policy environment and trade outlook could lead to different outcomes. In parallel, a drift towards greater fragmentation and increased geopolitical rivalry could have major implications for energy-related trade flows. These uncertainties underscore the value of supply diversification and resilient supply chains, notably for critical minerals. • Energy policies continue to evolve. The United States enhanced its backing for domestic fossil fuels and nuclear energy, while cutting support for wind, solar and electric vehicles. Many other countries also launched new policy initiatives in the last year, including a boost in policies designed to enhance energy security. Meanwhile, major gaps persist in the world’s provision of energy: 730 million people still lack access to electricity and nearly 2 billion are without access to clean cooking. • These new starting conditions are reflected in a fully revised and updated set of scenariosin this World Energy Outlook (WEO). All take as their starting point the same GDP and population assumptions. None of the scenarios are forecasts. • The Current Policies Scenario (CPS) considers a snapshot of policies and regulations that are already in place and offers a generally cautious perspective on the speed at which new energy technologies can be deployed in the energy system. • The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) considers the application of a broader range of policies, including those that have been formally tabled but not yet adopted as well as other official strategy documents that indicate the direction of travel. Barriers to the introduction of new technologies are lower than in the CPS, but this scenario does not assume that aspirational targets are met. • Further scenarios have normative elements and work towards defined outcomes. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario maps out an updated global pathway for the energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 87 2 2.1 Introduction The World Energy Outlook-2025 (WEO-2025) unfolds against an uncertain and unpredictable backdrop. Some key energy-producing countries are either parties to ongoing conflicts, notably Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, or vulnerable to spillovers from instability in the Middle East. At the same time, the economic outlook remains clouded by tensions over trade, fiscal weaknesses and high levels of debt. Worries about the security and affordability of energy supply spiked during the global energy crisis in 2022, and governments are reaching different conclusions about the best ways to respond. Meanwhile, rapid technological change continues, accelerating the rollout of energy technologies like batteries and the advance of artificial intelligence (AI). Despite this turbulence, demand for energy services is rising as the global economy grows and the world’s population increases, and electricity is playing an increasingly important role in meeting rising demand. It is also clear that difficult challenges lie ahead. Many people around the world still do not enjoy the benefits that modern energy can bring, while emissions from the energy sector are closely bound up with the risks and impacts of a changing climate, which are becoming clearer with each passing year. There can be no single or simple view on how the global energy outlook might develop. This is why the WEO includes a suite of updated scenarios, each based on a different set of assumptions about the policies, technologies and other factors that shape the outlook. None of these scenarios should be viewed as a forecast. Our aim is not to predict what will happen, but to provide a rigorous, data-driven framework for decision makers to consider their options and the consequences of different choices. This chapter sets the scene for the WEO by providing the broad energy and macroeconomic context, and by noting the new policies and geopolitical developments that shape the starting point for the analysis. It then introduces the revised set of WEO scenarios, which reflect a spectrum of possible outcomes, and discusses the inputs and assumptions that underpin them. There are two exploratory scenarios, the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) and the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), that examine different ways in which existing policies and policy announcements affect the development of the energy system. These scenarios do not assume that aspirational targets or objectives are met. There are also pathways with normative elements, that map out ways to achieve specific energy or climate goals. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario provides an updated pathway that brings emissions from the energy sector to net zero by mid-century. Chapter 6 introduces for the first time the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS) which charts an ambitious yet feasible pathway to universal access to clean cooking and electricity.

CC BY 4.0. 88 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 2.2 Context for the World Energy Outlook-2025 2.2.1 Energy demand, investment, technology and emissions trends Energy demand and electricity generation Total global energy demand continues to increase, rising by 2% in 2024 to more than 650 exajoules (EJ). Fossil fuels accounted for nearly four-fifths of total energy demand – a share that has decreased only marginally since 2000 (Figure 2.1). More substantial changes have occurred in the geographical breakdown of demand. In 2000, advanced economies accounted for more than half of global energy demand, but their demand peaked in 2007 and their share of global demand fell to one-third in 2024, which is much lower than their share of global gross domestic product (GDP) (measured at market exchange rates). By contrast, energy demand in emerging market and developing economies, led by China, has more than doubled since 2000. Overall energy demand increased by over 20% since 2010. Reductions in energy intensity averaged around 2% per year from 2010 to 2019, which mitigated the impact of rising demand, but recent years have seen a deceleration, and energy intensity fell by only 1.1% in 2024. Figure 2.1 ⊳ Global energy demand by fuel, and share in demand and GDP by region, 2000-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Global energy demand has increased 20% since 2010, with all the increase taking place in emerging market and developing economies Notes: EJ = exajoule; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. GDP is measured in market exchange rates. Demand for fossil fuels has continued to rise, although coal, oil and natural gas have followed different trajectories.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 89 2 renewables and natural gas began to play a larger role in global electricity generation. Today, coal demand growth is driven by emerging market and developing economies in Asia, while demand in advanced economies has declined by half from its 2007 peak. Oil and natural gas have both grown at a relatively steady rate since 2010, with average annual increases of 1.4 EJ and 2.4 EJ respectively. Growth in demand for renewables has accelerated, increasing by around 3 EJ per year on average over the last decade in primary energy terms. Total global energy demand increased in 2024 by over 2%, much more than the long-term average of 1.4% (2010-2023), partly as a result of soaring cooling demand amid record heatwaves. Renewables met much of this growth, rising by 5 EJ on the back of significant capacity additions for wind and solar PV (photovoltaics), and the cyclical recovery from a poor year for hydro in 2023. Natural gas demand also rose faster than in recent years. The jump in energy demand in 2024 was driven in particular by a surge of 1 100 terawatt\u0002hours (TWh) in electricity demand, which was nearly twice the long-term average. Over half of this surge in 2024 was in the buildings sector. The record increase in electricity generation from wind and solar PV in 2024, totalling nearly 700 TWh, was enough to meet 60% of the growth in electricity demand. Other renewables also expanded output well above recent trends. Nuclear power demonstrated a strong increase as a result of reactor restarts in advanced economies and new nuclear power plants in emerging market and developing economies. Long-term trends for electricity generation from fossil fuels indicate a slowdown in the increase of generation both from coal and natural gas (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2 ⊳ Annual change in electricity generation by source, 2010-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity demand increased in 2024 by nearly twice the long-term average, most of which was met by growth in renewables output, capping the upside for fossil fuels Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour.

CC BY 4.0. 90 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Total final consumption across end-use sectors increased by nearly 2% in 2024, rising faster than the average since 2010 and reaching over 450 EJ for the first time. This reflects, in part, a recent uptick in global energy consumption in industry, especially electricity-intensive manufacturing and oil-based feedstock for petrochemicals (Figure 2.3). The growth of energy consumption in industry, however, slowed markedly over the course of the last decade, not least as a result of economic restructuring in China, where industrial coal consumption peaked in 2014. Energy consumption in the transport sector also increased, though the growth of oil consumption in transport has been slowing as electric vehicles (EVs) and biofuels displace oil demand growth. Aviation and shipping accounted for all the 1 EJ increase in transport oil consumption in 2024, with oil demand for road transport flat. The long-term trend in the buildings sector is one of relatively linear increases in demand, averaging slightly more than 1 EJ per year since 2010. However, 2024 witnessed a larger increase in energy demand from buildings, mostly in the form of electricity. Record temperatures drove higher cooling needs, while demand rose for uses such as data centres and AI services. Figure 2.3 ⊳ Annual change in final consumption by source and sector, 2010-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity demand surged in 2024 in the industry and buildings sectors, while oil consumption growth in transport continued to slow Note: EJ = exajoule. Major gaps in global energy access persist, with many communities underserved or without any access to modern energy. Some progress has resumed since the disruption caused by the Covid pandemic and the global energy crisis, but the latest tracking data indicate that 730 million people around the world remain without access to electricity, largely in sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly 2 billion people still lack access to clean cooking. Instead, they rely on traditional stoves and open fires, which expose households to harmful smoke and -5 0 5 10 Industry Transport Buildings Coal Oil Natural gas Electricity Renewables -16 EJ 2010202420102024201020242010202420102024 IEA.

The lack of access to modern energy also constrains efforts to increase economic prosperity, improve access to education and meet a range of other objectives. Energy investment Investment in the energy sector rose to US dollars (USD) 3.2 trillion in 2024, up from an annual average of USD 2.6 trillion over the previous decade (Figure 2.4). The share of investment for sectors other than fossil fuels has risen quickly: low-emissions power, grids, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and end-use sector spending together accounted for USD 1 trillion ten years ago, which was less than 40% of the global total, but increased to over USD 2 trillion in 2024, accounting for more than 60% of the total. Figure 2.4 ⊳ Global energy-related investment, 2015-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy-related investment increased sharply from 2020, led by more spending on renewables, grids and storage, efficiency and end-use sectors Notes: MER = market exchange rate. Low-emissions fuels include modern bioenergy, low-emissions hydrogen\u0002based fuels and carbon capture, utilisation and storage associated with fossil fuels, including direct air capture. Spending on low-emissions power generation, notably solar PV, has almost doubled over the past five years. Investment in electricity grids is rising too, but is struggling to keep pace with the growth in power demand and rapid deployment of renewables. Nuclear investment is on a smaller scale, but is making a comeback, rising by over 70% over the past five years. Approvals of new gas-fired power have also risen, led by the United States and the Middle East, while fast growing electricity use and concerns about electricity security have spurred a wave of coal plant approvals in China. Weakening oil prices and demand expectations have weighed on upstream oil investment, which remains well below levels seen prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. 1 2 3 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Energy efficiency and end-use Grids and storage Nuclear Renewables Low-emissions fuels Coal Natural gas Oil Trillion USD (2024, MER) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 92 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 The geographic spread of energy investment is uneven and evolving: China is by far the world’s largest energy investor. Itsshare of global clean energy investment rose from around 25% ten years ago to almost 30% today. At the other end of the scale, many developing economies, especially in Africa, struggle to mobilise capital for energy infrastructure. Energy technologies Several energy technologies have seen substantial cost reductions and performance improvements in recent years. The global average prices of both solar PV and electric vehicle batteries fell by more than 80% between 2014 and 2024. As a result, the levelised cost of electricity from solar PV is now among the lowest of any power technology in history, although a fuller assessment of competitiveness should also include the value that different technologies bring to electricity systems (see Chapter 4, Box 4.4). Total system costs, including grid infrastructure, provide a comprehensive view of the impact of technology choice on electricity affordability (see Chapter 1, section 1.4). With the fall in battery prices, electric cars often have a lower total cost of ownership than internal combustion engine (ICE) equivalents. In some markets, most notably in China, they often also have a lower upfront purchase cost than equivalent ICE models (IEA, 2025a). On the other hand, capital cost reductions in wind power have been muted in recent years, due to higher commodity prices and supply chain constraints. The upstream oil and gas sector continues to experience some upward pressure on costs, partly as a result of expenses arising from technology development and deployment, though this has been offset to some extent by increases in capital efficiency (IEA, 2025b). Figure 2.5 ⊳ Global electricity generation capacity additions by type and annual sales of passenger cars by type, 2015-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 93 2 Solar PV capacity additions increased by ten-times from 2015 to 2024, with nearly 540 gigawatts (GW) added in 2024 (Figure 2.5). Capacity additions for wind increased from 65 GW in 2015 to around 115 GW in 2024, although annual trends show some volatility in individual years. Capacity additions of coal and natural gas-fired power plants halved from a total of 160 GW in 2015 to around 80 GW in 2024. However, the announced pipeline for new natural gas-fired power plants has jumped in recent years. Announced project pipelines for coal-fired plants rose after several years in which project cancellations outpaced new announcements. Capacity additions of hydropower and nuclear have been broadly stable at around 26 GW per year and 8 GW per year respectively since 2015. Sales of electric cars continued to expand in 2024, accounting for over 20% of the global car market. Global sales of ICE cars decreased by 1.5% in 2024 and are now almost one-quarter lower than in 2017, the year in which ICE car sales reached their highest point. Pure battery electric vehicles sales reached over 10 million in 2024, up fivefold since 2020. Building on similar underlying cost reductions, capacity additions of battery storage in the electricity sector in 2024 were more than 60-times higher than in 2015, reaching nearly 80 GW. Projects to capture energy-related CO2 emissions have only resulted in an operational capture capacity of around 50 million tonnes per year. Projects under construction look to more than double this capacity by 2030. Hydrogen production worldwide has increased by nearly 20% since 2015, though less than 1% of this was low-emissions hydrogen production. Low-emissions hydrogen production from projects that are operational, under construction or have reached a final investment decision is set to reach 4.2 million tonnes per year by 2030, representing a fivefold increase compared with 2024, but still well below government and industry ambitions at the start of this decade. Energy-related emissions and climate change Global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached an all-time high of 38.2 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2024, while energy-related emissions of methane remained at about 4.4 Gt CO2-equivalent. The annual pace of increase in CO2 emissions slowed to below 1% in 2024, with emissions continuing to decouple from economic growth at the global level. Most of the increase in emissions in 2024 was from natural gas, followed by coal. Low-emissions energy technologies – solar PV, wind, nuclear, electric cars and heat pumps – deployed since 2019 now prevent 2.6 Gt CO2 annually, equal to 7% of global emissions (IEA, 2025c). In advanced economies, total energy-related CO2 emissions fell by 1% in 2024, 20% below the peak level in 2007, but this decline was more than offset by increases elsewhere. Most of the global 2024 increase came from emerging market and developing economies other than China, where CO2 emissions rose by 2.4%. Emissions growth in China slowed in 2024, but its per capita emissions are nevertheless now 16% higher than in the advanced economies as a group (Figure 2.6). It is notable that 2024 was the warmest year ever recorded, with the global mean near\u0002surface temperature about 1.55 degree Celsius (°C) above pre-industrial levels(WMO, 2025). It was also confirmed as the first calendar year in which the average global temperature was IEA. CC BY 4.0. 94 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 more than 1.5 °C above its pre-industrial level.1 Extreme temperatures and climate change can affect the energy system in a number of ways, for example by pushing up electricity demand for cooling, increasing wildfire risks to energy infrastructure and affecting the efficiency of power plants and transmission lines (see Chapter 5). Extreme heat increased electricity demand in 2024, especially for cooling, contributing to the rise in energy-related CO₂ emissions (IEA, 2025c). If the weather in 2024 had been the same as in 2023, about half of the increase in global emissions would have been avoided.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now projects the global economy to grow by 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026 (IMF, 2025a). This increase comes despite headwinds caused by geopolitical instability and uncertainty about tariffs, highlighting the robustness of the global economy. 1 The Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C applies to long-term warming, typically measured over 20 years, rather than shorter periods, which can be strongly affected by natural climate variability. 4 8 12 16 2000 2024 China European Union India Japan United States World Total (Gt CO₂) 5 10 15 20 2000 2024 Per capita (t CO₂) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 1950 2024 Temperature rise (°C) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 95 2 Emerging market and developing economies are projected to grow by 4.2% in 2025 and 4% in 2026, and advanced economies by 1.6% in both years (IMF, 2025a). Poverty reduction in emerging market and developing economies slowed during the Covid-19 pandemic, and stronger inclusive growth will be critical to reversing this (World Bank, 2025a). Inflationary pressures have continued to ease in many countries, following spikes linked to the easing of lockdowns in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. One important contributory factor has been the continued moderation in global energy prices, despite geopolitical tensions. In part, this reflects adjustments in market balances for oil and gas, as highlighted in the WEO-2024. This cooling of inflation has allowed for a relaxation of monetary policy in many jurisdictions (Figure 2.7). Figure 2.7 ⊳ Central bank policy rates for selected economies, 2000 to July 2025 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Since 2024, rates in the United States, Euro Area and United Kingdom have fallen by up to 2%, while the rate in China fell modestly and in Japan it rose slightly Notes: US = United States Federal Reserve federal funds rate; Euro Area = European Central Bank marginal lending facility rate; Japan = Bank of Japan policy rate; UK = Bank of England bank rate; China = China one year benchmark lending rate (2000 to August 2019), People’s Bank of China loan prime rate one year (August 2019 to September 2025). Sources: FRED (2025a and 2025b); ECB (2025); Bank of England (2025); Bloomberg (2025). There are plenty of near-term uncertainties that bear on the economic outlook: notably the path for inflation and interest rates; the outcomes of current trade negotiations; the prospects for equity markets, some of which are trading at historically elevated valuations; and the course of political and geopolitical developments. There are also plenty of uncertainties about the global economy in the longer term, but a number of key structural trends have implications for the future (Figure 2.8). One of these is that the benefits of growth in global GDP per capita over the last decade have been uneven. Emerging market and developing economies other than China, as a group, have -2% 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 United States United Kingdom Japan China Euro Area IEA.

Whether this trend can be reversed will have important implications not only for poverty reduction but also for global energy demand trends in the decades to come. Figure 2.8 ⊳ Key trends influencing the global economy, 2008-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Sources: BIS (2025); CPB World Trade Monitor (2025); GTA (2025); United Nations Population Division (2024); World Bank (2025b). Another notable trend is the rise in government debt as a percentage of GDP in both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies. This risks potentially hampering efforts to invest in key infrastructure and implement energy policies that require a fiscal outlay, such as energy subsidies. It may also have knock-on effects such as higher long-term interest rates. 40% 80% 120% 2008 2024 20 40 60 2008 2024 1 2 3 2008 2024 60 120 180 40 80 120 2008 2024 Trade indicators Selected adv. economies Emerging market economies LDCs (external debt) China Advanced economies Other EMDE High-income countries Low/mid-income countries Replacement rate World trade volume (2021=100) Announced export restrictions (right axis) Birth rate (births per woman) Debt as share of GDP GDP per capita (thousand USD, 2024 PPP) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 97 2 Birthrates meanwhile have continued to decline across much of the world in recent years, in some cases substantially faster than expected on the basis of official forecasts. Declining birthrates and higher dependency ratios are likely to create a drag on GDP growth and increase fiscal pressures. Another macroeconomic issue relates to the outlook for geopolitics and its potential impact on trade and growth. Although trade volumes continue to expand, there has been a notable rise in the use of restrictive trade measures, including measures that place restrictions on access to technologies. Future developments in this area could have important implications for the macroeconomic and energy sector outlooks. Political and geopolitical uncertainties In a fragile international environment, energy-related trade has become increasingly subject to geopolitical considerations. The most obvious example is the reorientation of European energy imports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Russia sought to gain political leverage by withholding natural gas supplies and exposing European consumers to higher energy bills. In response, European Union imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), picked up sharply, particularly from the United States which accounted for 55% of EU LNG imports in the first half of 2025. The period of energy market volatility that followed Russia’s invasion also saw an acceleration in the deployment of renewables and efforts to increase energy efficiency in some key markets as governments sought to reduce fuel import bills. At the same time, attention is turning to risks in some newer value chains related to critical minerals and key energy technologies. These include risks arising from market concentration: the average market share of the top-three countries undertaking the refining of key energy minerals rose from around 82% in 2020 to 86% in 2024 (Figure 2.9). While many supply chain issues are not related to the geopolitical context, notable vulnerabilities have been exacerbated by recent policy developments. Since early 2025, for example, China has introduced a range of export controls on rare earth magnets, which are key to electric motor and generator components used in various energy-related technologies as well as in other strategic economic sectors. Due to these restrictions, exports from China of these key components fell by 75% between April and June 2025 impacting manufacturing activities in Europe and the United States. Concerns about supply chains – both in the energy sector and more broadly – are leading to a rise in industrial policies and strategies, as well as a series of new international partnerships. A fragile international environment also heightens potential risks associated with energy infrastructure and transit routes. These include risks related to key maritime routes, undersea infrastructure and electricity grids. International maritime shipping of energy products remains particularly sensitive to potential disruption at key chokepoints, including the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal and Red Sea, and the Panama Canal. There are also risks to energy infrastructure arising from vulnerabilities in the digital world: as energy systems have become increasingly electrified, integrated and connected, their vulnerability to cyberattacks has increased. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 98 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Against this background, governments face a difficult balancing act as they seek to manage potential trade-offs while trying to align as far as possible the goals of energy security, energy transitions, supply chain security, affordability and industrial policy. The approaches they take and the results they achieve will have a critical bearing on the outlook for energy. Figure 2.9 ⊳ Top-three supplying countries of selected critical minerals and clean technologies, 2020 and 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Both the supply of refined critical minerals and manufacturing of key energy technologies have become more concentrated in recent years Notes: Nickel and cobalt are for refining. Graphite is for battery grade production. Solar PV is for solar cell production. EV batteries are for battery cell production. Sources: IEA (2025a); IEA (2025d); IEA (2025e). 2.2.3 Energy policy developments Energy policies and regulations have critical influence on the direction of the energy sector. However, their impact is not always clear cut. Policies may have ill-defined or ambiguous objectives, can overachieve or undershoot their original goals, are subject to change over time and may be only near term in focus. Other factors such as market, price and technology trends also play crucial roles in shaping the direction of the energy sector. Nonetheless, given their importance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) tracks energy policies closely and maintains an up-to-date database of policies and measures covering 85 countries (IEA, 2025f). IEA policy tracking indicates that the last year has seen major new policies emerge in 48 countries covering a wide range of objectives and instruments, from energy performance standards to government financial incentives and pricing schemes. In this section we survey policy initiatives across multiple countries and sectors, including the new direction for energy policy in the United States. We also include a spotlight looking at the burgeoning adoption of measures related to energy security and emergency response. 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 2020202420202024202020242020202420202024 Rest of world Third-largest Second-largest China Indonesia Nickel Cobalt Graphite Solar PV EV batteries IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 99 2 The United States has made major changes to its federal priorities for energy research, investment and resource development. These changes are focused on removing obstacles to the development and use of domestic oil, natural gas and coal, and supporting nuclear energy and other technologies such as geothermal, while rolling back energy efficiency measures and reducing support for solar and wind power generation, and EVs (Box 2.1). The number of countries adopting regulations for energy performance standards saw a notable increase in the 2010s. These include emissions and fuel economy standards for vehicles and minimum energy performance standards for appliances and industrial motors. Major energy consuming countries adopted such standards early on, but the level of coverage plateaued in the 2020s (Figure 2.10). The recent repeal of efficiency measures in the United States reduces the policy coverage in several sectors. Renewable energy policies have seen similar trends, with a significant rise in policy adoption for power generation since 2010, and also a shift from use of feed-in tariffs to an increasing role for tendering and auctions. The scale of funding commitments and disbursements for various energy-related programmes has increased substantially since 2020, thanks in large part to provisions in post\u0002Covid-19 recovery plans put in place by advanced economies. New government support earmarked for the deployment of clean energy technologies and infrastructure since the pandemic totals over USD 2 trillion, although actual disbursements vary across countries and sectors. Box 2.1 ⊳ United States energy policy changes course In the past five years, the United States has seen very significant federal energy policy changes. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 in several respects represents a substantial change in direction for the energy sector, when compared to legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Policy changes in the United States can have a major impact on long-term energy trends globally as well as domestically. For example, together the shale revolution and the 2015 reversal of the US ban on crude oil exports fundamentally reshaped global oil markets and geopolitics, positioning the United States as the world’s leading oil producer, and at the same time bringing about lower prices and increased resilience in the face of oil supply disruptions. The rise of US shale is also an example of the way that multiple factors drive change in the energy sector: energy policies played an important role, but private sector innovation, risk-taking capital markets and high global energy prices also helped to drive growth. Announced and recently enacted policy measures affecting trade, regulation, funding and financing, are set to reshape US energy production, demand, end-uses and exports. The changes are designed to stimulate domestic production across a range of energy sources, focusing on oil, natural gas and coal as well as nuclear, geothermal, hydrogen and biofuels. The changes to energy-related tax credits and grants in the OBBBA (selected IEA. CC BY 4.0. 100 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 provisions summarised in Table 2.1) are reflected in the updated US projections in both the Current Policies Scenario and the Stated Policies Scenario, which also take state-level policies into account.

For example, Japan’s 7th Strategic Energy Plan outlined its Safety, Energy Security, Economic Efficiency and Environment (S+3Es) principles, alongside guidance on the envisaged energy mix to 2040. In Brazil, the Energy Transition Acceleration Programme sets new ambitions for the energy sector to promote clean energy employment, innovation and transition in coal mining regions. And in November 2025, an amendment to the European climate law was endorsed by EU Environment Ministers, setting a target to reduce emissions by 90% by 2040, relative to 1990 levels. Alongside ongoing policy developments, fourteen countries and regions adopted new targets for power generation over the past year. For example, the European Union member states agreed new goals for offshore wind capacity for 2030, 2040 and 2050; Korea set a target to raise the share of renewables and nuclear by 2038; along with its 7th Strategic Energy Plan, Japan referenced a goal for the share of generation to be met by renewables in 2040; both Indonesia and Viet Nam set goals for renewables and nuclear power capacity. In the buildings sector, several countries including Nigeria, Morocco and Malaysia put in place or announced new efficiency standards for air conditioners. Countries with expanding cooling needslike India and Saudi Arabia are upgrading their building energy codes to ensure new buildings are more resilient to heatwaves and other extreme weather events. Many countries with clean cooking and electricity access deficits, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are taking steps to bring about improvements. The IEA has tracked 25 new clean cooking access policies enacted or announced since 2024 in countries that are home to more than a third of people without clean cooking access. In the transport sector, some new incentives for EVs and charging infrastructure were introduced. Nigeria has started to exempt EVs and charging infrastructure from value-added tax, while India launched an incentive scheme for EVs (PM E-Drive). By contrast, a few countries, such as the United Kingdom, introduced greater flexibility in meeting their zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandates by allowing higher shares of plug-in hybrids. Canada paused its 2026 ZEV mandate to give the automotive industry additional time to prepare. Australia is implementing its first fuel efficiency standard and Indonesia increased its biodiesel blending mandates. In the industry sector, changes to emissions trading systems were announced in the last year related to carbon pricing as well as new support schemes. In February 2025, for example, the European Commission launched its Clean Industrial Deal, aiming to boost EU industrial competitiveness and decarbonisation through efforts to provide more affordable energy, stimulate demand for low-emissions industrial products, mobilise significant financing support, and promote access to critical raw materials. Some policy shifts come in waves, often in response to specific events or shocks. This has been the case with energy security policies in recent years, as countries have responded to the global energy crisis and emerging security vulnerabilities (Spotlight). However, the direction in which policy settings evolve is not preordained or uniform, and the adoption of specific policies reflects different national circumstances and priorities. The aim of the scenario analysis in the WEO-2025 is not to anticipate or prescribe changes, but to place them within a broad analytical framework to help understand their implications. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 103 2 Are governments better positioned to respond to energy security shocks than in the past? With geopolitical uncertainty on the rise and renewed volatility in energy markets, energy security has once again become a top priority for governments around the world. They are deploying a wide range of policies to be better prepared in case of an energy emergency. Since the oil crises of the 1970s, governments in net oil importing countries adopted policies and emergency response measures to mitigate the impacts of potential supply disruptions, while diversifying and increasing the efficiency of their energy portfolios. Virtually all main oil importers now have in place stockholding and demand restraint measures advocated by the IEA. Prior to the first oil crisis in 1973, only a handful of countries – representing less than 1% of net oil imports – had such emergency measures in place. Today, countries responsible for 99% of net oil imports have one or more oil security measure in place, and 61 countries have introduced emergency oil stock requirements (Figure 2.11). Figure 2.11 ⊳ Cumulative number of countries with selected emergency response and energy security policies, 1970-2025 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Since the 1970s, global events and energy crises have triggered a rise in emergency response and energy security policies worldwide Note: The analysis focuses on 85 countries, covering 93% of global primary energy demand, 87% of global oil demand and 95% of global natural gas demand. The number of natural gas security measures in place has grown rapidly in recent years. In 2015, stockholding requirements only covered countries accounting for 10% of net gas imports, a figure that has now risen to 34%, mostly made up by EU member countries. 10 20 30 40 50 60 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2025 1973 First oil crisis 1991 Gulf war 2022 Russia's invasion of Ukraine 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas crisis 1979 Second oil crisis Oil stockholding Oil demand restraint Gas demand restraint Gas stockholding Critical minerals stockholding 2011 Libyan civil war SPOTLIGHT IEA. CC BY 4.0. 104 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Demand restraint measures for natural gas such as fuel switching, interruptible contracts and load shedding have become increasingly common since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Over 40 net gas importing countries now have legislation in place to implement such measures, with 15 introducing them in the past ten years, including most European Union and Balkan countries. The focus of policy is expanding to cover emerging energy security threats, including those with a bearing on the supply of critical minerals, technology supply chains, electricity security, cybersecurity and climate resilience. To take one important example, the expanding number of trade restrictions on critical minerals and related manufactured products is leading to efforts to strengthen resilience to potential supply disruption, notably by putting in place strategic reserves of critical minerals, as the United States, China, Japan and Korea have done, and by adopting measures to diversify supply. The rising number of cyber and physical attacks on power infrastructure represents another important threat, especially against the background of rapid growth in demand for electricity. Countries are increasingly taking steps to integrate long-term strategic planning and reform regulatory frameworks and market design to improve operational security and resilience. The IEA supports regulatory discussions in each of these emerging security areas and established a Voluntary Critical Minerals Security Programme in 2022 and an Electricity Security Advisory Board in 2024 to help address these challenges. 2.3 WEO scenarios Analysis in the World Energy Outlook (WEO) provides a framework for understanding the future of energy, not by setting out a single vision of the future, but by examining several different potential scenarios for its development. Each scenario has the same starting point and is based on the latest data for energy supply and demand, markets, technology costs and policies, as well as the same pathways for future population and economic growth. None of the individual WEO scenarios should be regarded as a forecast. The energy system described and explored in each scenario evolves in a distinctive pathway that delivers energy services with a different mix of technologies and fuels, with varying implications for energy security, affordability and emissions. This is primarily due to differing assumptions about how energy policies are implemented and evolve, and how these interact with the evolution of energy technologies and markets. This edition of the WEO examines the outlook for the energy system through an updated set of scenarios. The first two, the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) and the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) do not target a specific endpoint or objective but rather establish different sets of starting conditions and explore where they may lead. Of the many factors that can influence the evolution of the energy sector, policies play a profound role, and are the key differentiating factor between these two scenarios. However, IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 105 2 policies are generally only a partial guide to the direction of travel. They are sometimes imprecise, can have unintended consequences, and are subject to change. To reflect the wider complexity of factors that can shape the evolution of the energy system, the design of the CPS and STEPS also reflects the speed and extent to which technology challenges and barriers to change in the energy sector are overcome.  The Current Policies Scenario (CPS) returns in this Outlook, setting out a pathway for the future of the energy system in which no change in energy-related policies is assumed beyond what is already in place. The CPS therefore builds on a narrow reading of today’s policy settings, only considering those that are adopted in legislation and regulation, and assuming no change, even where governments have indicated their intention to do so. Where existing policies target a range of outcomes, it is assumed that the lower end of the range is achieved. In the CPS, policies that are time-bound or that target specific years are not strengthened after they expire. Alongside this view of the policy landscape, the CPS also offers a generally cautious perspective on the speed at which new energy technologies are deployed and integrated into the energy system. It tends to project slower growth in the adoption of new technologies in the energy system than seen in recent years, or than projected in the STEPS.  The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) builds on a broader reading of the policy landscape than the CPS, also taking account of those policies that have been formally tabled but not yet adopted as well as other official strategy documents that indicate the direction of travel. These could include, for example, development plans for the power sector that aim to achieve a certain mix of generation assets by a specific date; or plans to reform the regulatory framework for part of the transport sector or to achieve a certain level of efficiency for new or retrofitted buildings. Such targets are not automatically assumed to be met; the prospects and timing for their realisation are subject to an assessment of relevant market, infrastructure and financial constraints. Another difference with the CPS relates to time-bound policies. Whereas the CPS assumes no further change in a policy once it expires, the STEPS assumes that time\u0002bound policies are prolonged into the future and retain a similar pace of change. In addition, the STEPS offers a more dynamic perspective on energy technology and market trends, and it allows for a slightly more rapid introduction of new energy technologies than the CPS. However, like the CPS, the STEPS does not assume that aspirational goals, such as those included in the Paris Agreement, are achieved. In addition, we include scenarios that have normative elements relating to energy access or the achievement of various goals related to emissions. This means that these scenarios work toward a defined outcome and map out a way to achieve it.  The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario maps out a pragmatic but ambitious global pathway for the energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and is consistent with a long-term goal of limiting the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5 °C (with a 50% probability). In contrast with previous editions of the WEO, the IEA. CC BY 4.0. 106 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 NZE Scenario is no longer a limited-overshoot scenario, as warming peaks above 1.6 °C and exceeds 1.5 °C for several decades before returning below 1.5 °C by 2100. These changes in the scenario trajectory reflect the reality of persistently high emissions in recent years and slow or uneven momentum behind the deployment of some policies and technologies. In addition to very rapid progress with the transformation of the energy sector, bringing the temperature rise back down below 1.5 °C by 2100 also requires widespread deployment of CO2 removal technologies that are currently unproven at large scale.  The Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS) – an additional scenario included for the first time in this WEO – is a data-driven roadmap to achieve universal access to electricity by 2035 and clean cooking by 2040. It is grounded in practical constraints and solutions, examining what historical rates of progress have been achieved in the past, and then prioritises cost-effective, proven means to replicate those successes. It explores all relevant fuels and technologies needed to achieve universal access as well as the infrastructure, policies and financing needed to scale them up. This year’s Outlook does not include the Announced Pledges Scenario, which models a future for the energy system in which all national energy and climate targets, such as countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term, low-emissions development strategies, are achieved in full and on time.2 Our assessment of the new round of NDCs due this year, generally covering the period to 2035, will follow once there is a more complete picture of these pledges. 2.3.1 GDP and population The global economy is assumed to grow by 2.6% on average annually to 2050 across all scenarios (Table 2.2). Out to 2030, our GDP assumptions at a country and regional level are based on the IMF World Economic Outlook (April 2025), with global GDP projected to grow by 3% annually over this period (IMF, 2025c). This projection is similar to the rate of growth in the IMF October 2025 assessment (IMF, 2025a). After 2030, GDP growth assumptions are based on Oxford Economics forecasts (Oxford Economics, 2025) and the application of the Solow growth model (World Bank, 2022). The Solow model estimates future GDP on a country and regional basis by accounting for labour supply, capital stock, and total factor productivity (TFP). TFP growth reflects catch-up dynamics in lower income countries and convergence towards advanced economy levels.3 Economic assumptions are held constant across the various scenarios to facilitate comparisons between them, although we recognise 2 NDCs are national climate action plans by each country under the Paris Agreement, submitted every five years to the UNFCCC secretariat. The Paris Agreement provides that successive NDCs will represent a progression compared to the previous NDC and reflect its highest possible ambition. 3 Details on GDP and other macroeconomic assumptions are available in the IEA GEC-Model documentation (IEA, 2025g). IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 107 2 that decisions taken by policy makers in the energy sector have broader economic implications. The global population – another major driver of global energy trends – is expected to expand from 8.1 billion in 2024 to 9.6 billion in 2050, based on the medium population projection of the United Nations World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2024). This represents a slowing of annual global population growth from roughly 1% over the last decade to 0.6% by 2050, although the population in sub-Saharan Africa increases by 70% over the period. Demographic changes impact GDP growth and therefore energy demand. Regions with rising working age populations, such as India and Indonesia, are set to see stronger energy demand growth, whereas ageing societies, such as Japan and Korea, are likely to experience slower growth or declines in energy demand. These demographic shifts also influence the structure of energy use: younger populations drive energy demand in transport, construction and manufacturing, while older populations tend to increase residential energy consumption.

Sources: IEA analysis based on IMF (2025c) and Oxford Economics (2025). UN projections for future global population growth have been successively lowered in recent years. Population growth to 2050 is concentrated in emerging market and developing economies, which are expected to account for over 95% of the global increase over the period, and these regions have seen the most significant downgrades (Figure 2.12). Projectionsin this Outlook are based on a population growth figure for these economiesfrom 2019 to 2050 which is 161 million lower than in the WEO in 2022. IEA.

For further details on population assumptions used in this World Energy Outlook, see Annex B. Source: United Nations (2024). The largest change is in China, whose population in 2050 is now assumed to be 51 million lower than estimated in the WEO-2024, and 127 million lower than in the WEO-2022. China’s population peaked in 2021 and is now in long-term decline. Indeed, China is set to experience the largest absolute decline of any country between 2024 and 2050, with its population falling by nearly 160 million to levels last seen in 1999. This Outlook update also includes downward 2050 population revisions for Africa and Southeast Asia, and smaller upward revisions for the Middle East. The downward shift in assumptions about global population growth to 2050 has implications for long-term energy use: it implies fewer additional cars on the road and homes to heat and cool, and lower additional demand for material goods. 2.3.2 Prices Oil prices In our scenarios, oil prices function as a balancing mechanism for global supply and demand, ensuring market stability. As such, the trajectories are smooth and show a sustained equilibrium, although in practice volatility and uncertainty are ever-present features of oil markets (Table 2.3). In the Current Policies Scenario, strong and sustained growth in oil demand leads to oil prices reaching USD 106/barrel in 2050 to incentivise the necessary production of resources. 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 WEO-2022 (UN 2019) WEO-2024 (UN 2022) WEO-2025 (UN 2024) Population growth, 2019-2050 Billion people -150 -100 -50 0 50 Other EMDE Middle East India SE Asia Africa China WEO-2022 to WEO-2024 WEO-2024 to WEO-2025 Change in population growth, 2019-2050 Million people IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 109 2 Market balances in this scenario depend on how major producers in different regions maintain high levels of production and how they manage their costs. In the Stated Policies Scenario, decreasing oil demand brings down the price at which markets find equilibrium, but high levels of investment are still required to compensate for declining output from existing fields and for the development of new resources (IEA, 2025b). Prices remain around 2024 levels over the next decade and decrease modestly to 2050. In the NZE Scenario, robust policies are required to effectively neutralise any increase in demand that might result from lower prices, ensuring that climate objectives remain on track. In the NZE Scenario, oil prices fall to USD 33/barrel by 2035 and USD 25/barrel by 2050 as oil demand declines.

MER = market exchange rate; MBtu = million British thermal units. The IEA crude oil price is a weighted average of import prices among IEA member countries. Natural gas prices are weighted averages expressed on a gross calorific-value basis. The US natural gas price reflects the wholesale price prevailing on the domestic market. Natural gas prices in the European Union and China reflect a balance of pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, while the Japan gas price is solely for LNG imports. LNG prices are those at the customs border prior to regasification. Steam coal prices are weighted averages adjusted to 6 000 kilocalories per kilogramme. The US steam coal price reflects mine mouth prices plus transport and handling costs. Coastal China steam coal price reflects a balance of imports and domestic sales, while the European Union and Japanese steam coal prices are solely for imports. Wholesale prices exclude any emissions pricing applied at the point of use. Natural gas prices In contrast to oil, there is no global natural gas price but rather a series of regional prices that are loosely connected by an increasingly liquid market for internationally traded gas, primarily in the form of LNG. Around 60% of LNG is currently delivered under long-term contracts with oil-linked pricing formulas or indexed to gas market prices: the remainder is traded on the spot market. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 110 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Our gas price benchmarks are weighted average prices that incorporate these different pricing methods. They represent an equilibrium between supply and demand that ensures that new projects come online in a timely manner and can cover their long-run marginal cost of supply. They also consider market conditions in the years ahead; in periods of ample supply availability, prices may for a period reflect the short-run marginal cost of supply. For example, the price of LNG in the European Union in 2035 in the STEPS is around USD 6.2 per million British thermal units (MBtu), based on the US Henry Hub price plus a 15% uplift, some capital recovery for LNG liquefaction terminals, variable shipping fees and a regasification charge. The oil-indexation price is just above USD 8/MBtu. Around 90% of gas in 2035 is priced on a gas hub-indexation basis and 10% on an oil-indexation level, meaning the weighted average gas import price is around USD 6.5/MBtu. Global gas trade is expected to continue shifting toward LNG. Over the period to 2030, around 300 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new LNG export capacity is set to come online, led by the United States, Qatar and Canada – the largest wave of global capacity additions ever. This will put downward pressure on prices over the coming years, but the impacts vary by scenario. In the CPS, the new supply is absorbed relatively quickly by robust increases in demand. With strong domestic demand growth and a surge in LNG exports, the United States sees its domestic gas price rise from USD 2.2/MBtu in 2024 to USD 4.5/MBtu in 2035; afterwards China, European Union and Japan also see modest price increases to 2050 driven by their increasing exposure to tightening LNG balances. In the STEPS, downward price pressures and a well-supplied global gas market remains into the 2030s. In the NZE Scenario, global demand and prices are both much lower throughout the Outlook period: they remain significantly below 2024 levels by 2035 as the rapid expansion of renewables and electrification limits gas demand growth, despite abundant LNG availability. Coal prices Over time, demand for steam coal declines across all the WEO-2025 scenarios, which has implications for price trajectories. In the CPS, prices need to be high enough to maintain existing mines and incentivise the opening of new ones: this maintains prices at relatively high levels, although some major importers nonetheless see significant declines from current levels. In the STEPS, an earlier downturn in demand in China pulls down global prices more quickly. In the NZE Scenario, falling demand brings prices down to very low levels: higher cost mines are forced to close, and no new mines are needed. More than for any other fuel, the global trajectory for coal is determined by a handful of major consuming countries, notably China and India, whose consumption of coal for power generation accounts for nearly half of current coal use worldwide. Critical mineral prices Critical mineral prices are increasingly important in today’s energy sector. They do not have the same economic influence on near-term energy prices as fuel prices, but they significantly influence the overall cost of key energy technologies. For example, lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite have a major impact on battery manufacturing; copper is at the heart of a more IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 111 2 electrified energy system. Prices for base metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc rebounded in 2024 and have continued to rise in 2025, driven by increasing demand and tightening supply dynamics. By contrast, demand growth for many battery metals has been outstripped by new supply growth, bringing prices down sharply: lithium prices, which had surged in 2021-2022, have fallen by over 85% since the start of 2023. We do not yet generate equilibrium prices that balance supply and demand of critical minerals in the same way as for fuels, as there are many sources of demand coming from outside the energy sector, but our analysis of current technology trends and future market balances nonetheless provides insights about possible price pressures. Ample supply means that prices for battery metals are likely to remain subdued in the near term, although our project-by-project analysis of lithium supply indicates that further project development will be required to keep pace with strong demand growth. Copper presents a more worrying picture: mined output growth has been relatively slow because of declining resource quality, the increasing complexity and capital intensity of projects, and long project lead times – all factors that are likely to persist in the future. Despite the possibility of some material substitution and additional recycling, there is a significant risk of tighter markets for copper as demand increases for its use not just in energy technologies and power grids but also in construction and industrial applications. Price and volume risks for critical minerals are also linked in many cases to the highly concentrated nature of supply, with China having an exceptionally strong position in refining and processing of many minerals. Carbon prices Carbon pricing instruments are increasingly being used to mitigate emissions in the energy sector. Eighty direct carbon pricing instruments are now in place – five more than in 2024. Coverage of these schemes has risen to about 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with most of the increase stemming from the expansion of the emissions trading system (ETS) in China to the cement, steel and aluminium sub-sectors. Despite this increased coverage, government revenues of USD 102 billion in 2024 were 1.9% lower than in 2023. This slight decrease in revenue reflects a decline in ETS allowance prices in large systems, including the European Union and United Kingdom emissions trading systems. It also reflects the abolition in Canada from March 2025 of the federal fuel charge, which was introduced in 2019 to price carbon emissions from the transport and buildingssectors. However, Canada’s Output-Based Pricing System for power and industry remains unchanged. The CPS only considers laws and regulations already in place. It excludes carbon taxes, emissions trading systems and reforms to extend existing systems that have yet to be implemented. The STEPS incorporates both existing and scheduled carbon pricing systems. It assumes that ETS allowance prices rise continuously, and that carbon taxes and other non\u0002market mechanisms remain constant unless scheduled to increase. It also includes planned reforms to extend coverage and to phase out free allowances. The NZE Scenario assumes that carbon prices are introduced in all regions and most energy sectors, and that they vary with the level of mitigation required in each region and level of development. Prices reach USD 250 per tonne of carbon dioxide (t CO2) in 2050 for advanced economies, USD 200/t CO2 for selected emerging markets, and USD 55/t CO2 for other emerging market and developing IEA. CC BY 4.0. 112 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 economies, on the assumption that regions also pursue more direct policies to adapt and transform their energy systems. The level of carbon prices included in our scenarios should be interpreted with caution. A broad range of energy policies and accompanying measures, including energy performance standards and incentive programmes, interact with carbon pricing, lowering the need for a high CO2 price to reduce emissions. As a result, CO2 prices in our scenarios do not represent the marginal cost of abatement. (See Annex B for more details of assumptions and coverage). 2.3.3 Technology costs The evolution of technology costs in the WEO-2025 scenarios is built into the modelling framework via a continuous process of technology improvement and learning over time, offset in some cases – notably for fossil fuels – by upward pressure on costs due to resource depletion. These processes play out differently in each scenario. Technology costs differ from the prices ultimately paid by end-users, which are shaped not only by underlying costs but also by market design, regulatory frameworks, and policies affecting trade and affordability. In the case of energy technologies, costs are linked to cumulative deployment, so they come down more quickly in scenarios where deployment is faster. In the case of fossil fuels, high demand scenarios tend to feature higher costs as more remote, geologically challenging and expensive resources come into play. We do not assume any major new technology breakthroughs in the WEO scenarios, but the modelling framework contains a very rich representation of energy technologies across all parts of the energy sector, including those that are judged to be approaching commercialisation. The IEA Clean Energy Equipment Price Index tracks price movements for a global basket of solar PV modules, wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries for EVs and battery storage, weighted by shares of investment (Figure 2.13). High critical minerals prices and supply chain problems pushed up the cost of a number of key clean energy technologies in 2021 and 2022, but prices for most energy technologies have fallen significantly since then. The index reached its lowest ever level in 2024, thanks in large part to price reductions for batteries and solar PV. This comes after a decade of cost decreases for these technologies, during which prices for solar PV and EV batteries have both fallen by more than 80%. Battery prices hit a record low of USD 115 per kilowatt (kW) in 2024, with average battery pack prices falling by 20% – the largest annual drop since 2017. This was largely driven by major price declinesfor lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite. Other factors include: fierce price competition as battery manufacturers vied for market share amid considerable excess manufacturing capacity, particularly in China; increasing adoption of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries (around 30% cheaper than lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries); and improved economies of scale. Battery prices fell in all markets, but the extent of the drop varied across regions. In China, prices fell around 30% in 2024, compared with 10-15% in the United States and Europe, due to stronger price competition and more rapid adoption of LFP battery technologies. IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Nominal prices. Sources: IEA analysis based on company financial reports and BNEF (2024). Solar PV prices reached historic lows in 2024, almost 45% lower than in 2023 as the cost of panels rapidly decreased. As with batteries and as detailed in previous World Energy Outlooks, significant excess manufacturing capacity for solar PV underpinned intense competition between the main Chinese manufacturers, which pushed margins into negative territory across the supply chain from polysilicon production through to module manufacturing. The resulting financial turmoil has since prompted a series of efforts in China to stabilise the market, but these have met with limited success so far, and the overhang of manufacturing capacity is likely to maintain downward pressure on solar PV prices. Although global wind turbine costs decreased by 2% in 2024 from 2023, western manufacturers maintained higher prices in order to recover from the financial difficulties of previous years in which project profitability fell. Onshore projects generally are proving resilient in the face of higher turbine prices, but the offshore market has suffered considerable setbacks, exacerbated in some cases by policy changes: investment and projects have been scaled back, and some major oil companies have spun off their offshore wind portfolios. Natural gas turbines, like other mature technologies, have seen comparatively limited underlying cost changes in the past decade, having already benefited from the type of cost reductions that technologies experience as they mature.

CC BY 4.0. 114 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 recent upward price pressure for some gas turbines, particularly for new orders that incur premiums to avoid the already long queue. For example, in the United States, reported construction costs for new efficient gas turbines to be added in 2030 are roughly double recent costs (GridLab, 2025). While this may affect short-term trends, it is less likely to indicate long-term implications for gas turbine prices. Nuclear power experienced significant delays and cost overruns in recent years for large\u0002scale reactors in Europe and the United States, which on average have been completed eight years later than planned and cost 2.5-times as much as originally estimated (IEA, 2025h). However, some nuclear projects have been completed closer to original timelines and cost estimates in other countries, including China, Russia and Korea. Grid investment costs have been pushed up by recent price increases for new transformers and cables; however, new manufacturing facilities are being planned and built that should ease these constraints over time. These include major projects such as a medium-voltage cable manufacturing plant in Morocco that is expected to begin operation in 2026. Upstream oil and gas operations face some upward cost pressure driven by high utilisation rates for specialised equipment such as drill ships and semi-submersibles. In addition, trade frictions in the United States have raised the price of imported steel and aluminium, both of which are critical inputs to pipelines, rigs and other oilfield infrastructure, further intensifying cost pressures.

Chapter 2 | Setting the scene 115 2 Looking ahead, the installed costs of renewables such as solar PV, onshore and offshore wind are set to continue to decline, as are costs for battery storage (Figure 2.14). The extent of these declines varies by country, region and scenario, depending on starting points and global deployment trends. The IEA Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model incorporates a technology-specific, local learning-by-doing process for projected capital costs – particularly for technologies such as renewables whose markets are maturing – as well as global learning through technology innovation. By contrast, oil and gas resources are generally set to become more expensive to extract over time, with continued upstream innovation and technology improvements more than offset by the effects of resource depletion (IEA, 2025b). However, recent experience provides a reminder that cost trajectories are unlikely to be smooth and linear, and that governments need to pay close attention to potential vulnerabilities and imbalances in supply chains. IEA. CC BY 4.0. PART B OUTLOOKS BASED ON EXISTING TRENDS AND POLICIES Part B describes the trends for energy demand, emissions, power generation, and fuels in our exploratory scenarios. Neither of which is a forecast or prediction. Chapter 3 explores the Current Policies Scenarios, which considers a snapshot of policies and regulation that are already in place and offers a generally cautious perspective on the speed at which new energy technologies can be deployed and integrated into the energy system. Chapter 4 examines the Stated Policies Scenario, which considers the application of a broader range of policies, including those that have been formally tabled but not yet adopted as well as other official strategy documents that indicate the direction of travel. Barriers to the introduction of new technologies are lower than in the Current Policies Scenario, but this scenario does not assume that aspirational targets are met. Chapter 5 compares the outcomes of the Stated Policies Scenario and the Current Policies Scenario, examining both elements of continuity and change across all fuels and technologies. It assesses the implications of the two scenarios for energy security, emissions and the environment, as well as investment and affordability trends. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 119 Chapter 3 Current Policies Scenario Expanding the world we know • Total final consumption rises in the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) by around 1.3% each year over the next decade, similar to the average annual increase over the last decade: global industrial output, appliance ownership and demands for mobility all increase, while energy efficiency gains are modest. • Demand for oil rises to 113 million barrels per day by 2050, mainly due to its increased use in emerging market and developing economies for road transport, petrochemical feedstocks, and aviation. Electric vehicle (EV) uptake stalls in regions lacking strong policy support: China and Europe are the main exceptions, and they see continued growth in EV sales. Global natural gas demand rises to 5 600 billion cubic metres by 2050: demand in the Middle East increasesstrongly, but developing economies in Asia are the largest source of demand growth, and their rising supply needs are met by new pipelines from Russia to China and by increased flows of liquefied natural gas. • Oil and gas prices rise to 2050 in the CPS. The United States remains the world’s largest oil and gas producer through to 2050, but oil production of the OPEC+ in 2050 is 15% higher than at any point in history. The CPS assumes that, by the latter part of the projection period, constraints on oil production and trade in countries currently subject to sanctions ease, so their output is determined by the underlying economics. If this is not the case, and geopolitical constraints remain in place, demand could be met through increased production in other countries, but this would entail increased investment, and would probably also mean higher prices. • Electricity demand rises in all countries and regions, with the strongest growth in India and Indonesia, but the push for a much more electrified energy system does not gain broad momentum in the CPS. Solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are cost competitive in many regions, but deployment faces integration challenges that slow further growth: annual solar PV capacity additions average 540 gigawatts to 2035, similar to the level in 2024. Coal remains the largest single source of global power generation for the next ten years. Construction of new nuclear facilities accelerates in the 2030s. Global electricity gridsincrease by 25 million kilometres (km), a 30% increase, to 2035, and by a further 40 million km to 2050. • Annual global energy-related CO2 emissions rise slightly from current levels and approach 40 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year in the early 2030s, remaining around this level through to 2050. Emissions fall in aggregate in advanced economies, most substantially in Europe, and decline in China from 2030 onwards, but they increase elsewhere. Total greenhouse gas emissions lead to a global average surface temperature rise of around 2 °C in 2050 and 2.9 °C in 2100. SUMMARY IEA.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 121 3 3.1 Introduction This edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO) reintroduces the Current Policies Scenario (CPS). It was a regular feature of the International Energy Agency suite of scenarios until the WEO-2020, when it was discontinued amid turmoil in energy markets and rapid changes in the policy landscape during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now that the world has passed through the pandemic and the global energy crisis triggered at the outset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there is merit in revisiting the CPS, a scenario that relies only on measures that are formally written into existing legislation and regulation, and which does not consider any additional changes to policy, even where governments have announced an intention to enact them. (Details of the Current Policies Scenario design are in Chapter 2). The CPS is not a forecast or a prediction of the way the energy system will unfold. Nor should it be interpreted as a “business-as-usual” scenario. There are several parts of the energy system today where innovative technologies are already being deployed at scale, underpinned by robust economics and mature, existing policy frameworks. In these areas, business-as-usual would imply continuing the current process of change. However, in the CPS, we assume that potential constraints, whether due to insufficient infrastructure, a lack of institutional capacity or financing, or the absence of continued policy support, slow the uptake of these new technologies. The CPS sees higher levels of total energy demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than our other scenarios. This should not be taken as a sign that more energy needs are met in the CPS than in the other scenarios. Slightly higher prices curtail energy service demands in some cases, for example, reducing the distances projected to be travelled by car, while the slowdown in efficiency measures means that more energy is used in the CPS to deliver the same level of energy service compared with other scenarios, for example for space cooling. This chapter describes the key outcomes of the CPS projections. It starts with an overview of the headline findings for energy demand and emissions, and moves on to review consumption in the main end-use sectors, exploring policy and technology assumptions. The electricity sector discussion examines the interplay between new and traditional sources of generation in various markets, as rapid electricity demand growth is met by expanding the use of almost all sources of electricity, including nuclear power. The concluding section is the outlook for fossil fuels, with a focus on the wide range of production sources and the supply dynamics that are needed to satisfy continued growth in demand for oil and natural gas. 3.2 Overview 3.2.1 Total energy demand Global energy demand rose by 1.6% per year between 2015 and 2024. In the CPS, it increases by 1.2% annually to 2035, adding demand equivalent to that of the United States today. Emerging market and developing economies account for 90% of the increase. After 2035, the annual average increase in demand slows to 0.8% (Figure 3.1). IEA. CC BY 4.0. 122 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Figure 3.1 ⊳ Total energy demand by fuel and region in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Around 90% of global energy demand growth comes from emerging market and developing economies, and global oil and natural gas use rises through to 2050 Notes: EJ = exajoule; C & S = Central and South America. Other includes traditional use of biomass and non-renewable waste. Among emerging market and developing economies, energy demand in India grows the fastest, increasing by 3% each year on average to 2035. Energy demand increases by 2.6% per year in Southeast Asia, 2.4% per year in the Middle East, and 2.1% per year in Africa. China was responsible for more than half of the global increase in total energy demand over the past 25 years, but as its economy changes shape, demand grows by 1.1% each year on average to 2035, much lower than the 3.6% annual increase seen between 2015 and 2024. Energy demand in advanced economies increases by around 0.15% on average each year to 2035 in the CPS. Demand rises in the United States in all end-use sectors, but falls in Europe and Japan, where rising demand, notably from data centres and space cooling, is more than offset by efficiency and electrification policies that drive down overall energy use. Deployment rates of clean energy technologies and efficiency measures stagnate or decline in many regions in the CPS, but continue to rise in a number of countries, including those where efficiency measures have short payback periods, where clean energy technologies are the most affordable option, or where current policies point towards increased deployment of particular clean energy technologies, including nuclear. More than 40 countries have policies in place to expand the use of nuclear power, investment has doubled since 2015, and there is a growing pipeline of projects under development: as a result, global nuclear capacity in the CPS expands by one-third by 2035. The rapid growth seen in recent years in solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind capacity additions fades in the CPS. Yet, renewable energy expands by around 70% to 2035, with two-thirds of the global solar PV and wind capacity additions installed in China in the next decade (Figure 3.2). 200 400 600 800 1 000 2015 2024 2035 2050 Rest of world Africa Middle East C & S America Southeast Asia India China Japan and Korea European Union North America By region (EJ) 50 100 150 200 250 2015 2024 2035 2050 By fuel (EJ) Renewables Oil Natural Coal Nuclear Other gas IEA.

Renewables and nuclear rise fastest to 2035 in China; India leads oil and coal growth; and the Middle East sees the largest increase in natural gas Note: EJ = exajoule; C & S America = Central and South America. Coal use starts to decline globally before 2030. Today power generation accounts for two\u0002thirds of worldwide coal consumption, but continued deployment of solar PV, wind and nuclear starts to outpace electricity demand growth in most regions, driving down the use of coal in power generation in nearly all regions, with the main exception of Southeast Asia. Coal use in industry falls in China and most advanced economies but it expands in India and other emerging market and developing economies, and it remains broadly flat globally through to 2050. Oil demand, excluding biofuels, rises by more than 5 million barrels per day (mb/d) to reach 105 mb/d in 2035 in the CPS, mainly because of increased use of oil in road transport in emerging market and developing economies, for aviation and shipping, and as petrochemical feedstock. Meeting this demand leads to increased production from a wide range of countries, including countries currently subject to sanctions, and low-cost producer countries that expand beyond announced capacity limits. It also brings about an increase in oil prices to facilitate new development in regions where production costs are relatively high. If today’s geopolitical constraints were to remain in place to 2050, other countries could increase supply in place of those subject to sanctions, but this would require additional investment and might well raise oil prices further. Natural gas demand increases by 800 billion cubic metres (bcm) to around 5 000 bcm in 2035 in the CPS, with volumes traded as liquefied natural gas (LNG) expanding by 60% to 880 bcm. -12 -6 0 6 12 18 24 China India European Union North America C & S America Southeast Asia Middle East Japan and Korea EJ Renewables Oil Natural gas Coal Nuclear Africa IEA. CC BY 4.0. 124 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 3.2.2 CO2 emissions Annual global energy-related CO2 emissions rise from 38 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2024 to 39 Gt in the early 2030s and remain around this level to 2050, with increasing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use in the industry and transport sectors offset by declining emissions in the power sector. The share of total emissions accounted for by the power sector declines from 40% in 2024 to less than 35% in 2050 as coal-fired generation is replaced by renewables and natural gas. However, emissions from coal use in industry rise marginally to 2050, and coal remains the largest single source of CO2 emissions. Figure 3.3 ⊳ CO2 emissions by sector and region in the CPS, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. CO2 emissions increase in industry and transport but decline in power, leading to a broad plateau in emissions through to 2050 Note: Gt CO2 = gigatonnes of carbon dioxide; C & S America = Central and South America. Large differences in emissions trends emerge (Figure 3.3). CO2 emissions in advanced economies – accounting for about 30% of today’s global total – decline by around 1% per year, as they have on average over the last decade. To 2050, CO2 emissions drop by around 60% in the European Union and by 10% in North America. CO2 emissions in China, which accounts for a further one-third of the global total today, rise marginally to 2030, before starting a slow decline. The rest of the world – accounting for just under 40% of global emissions today – increases CO2 emissions by around 1% per year, and accounts for more than half of total emissions in 2050. In 2050, per capita emissions in emerging market and developing economies excluding China are around 2.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide (t CO2), which is a fraction of the level in the rest of the world in 2050: 5.7 t CO2 per person in advanced economies and 7.5 t CO2 per person in China. Methane emissions from the energy sector decline from around 145 million tonnes (Mt) today to 140 Mt in 2035, with emissions arising from increased fossil fuel use more than offset by continued efforts in some countries to reduce the emissions intensity of production. 10 20 30 40 2015 2024 2035 2050 North America European Union Japan and Korea China Southeast Asia C & S America Middle East Africa By region India Rest of world 4 8 12 16 2015 2024 2035 2050 By sector Gt CO2 Power Industry Transport Buildings Other IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 125 3 Taken together, the level of CO2, methane and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would lead to a global average surface temperature rise of around 2 degrees Celsius (°C) in 2050 and 2.9 °C in 2100 (see Chapter 5). 3.3 Total final consumption Total final consumption rose by an average of 1.3% each year over the past decade to reach just over 450 exajoules (EJ) globally in 2024. In the CPS, it continues to increase by around 1.3% per year through to 2035. The average annual reduction in end-use energy intensity, measured as total final consumption excluding the traditional use of biomass per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), was 1.7% over the past decade. In the CPS, it averages 1.6% to 2035 and 1.4% between 2035 and 2050 (Figure 3.4). Current policies, such as those that have energy efficiency standards for new vehicle and appliance sales, contribute to some of these future reductions in intensity, and so does the gradual replacement and updating of the existing stock. In the CPS, however, policies are not renewed or strengthened after they reach the end of the current policy period, which means that increases in efficiency and electrification slow over time. In most advanced economies, per capita total final consumption has been declining since the 2000s. In the CPS, it remains at around today’s level to 2035. In many emerging market and developing economies, per capita total final consumption, excluding the traditional use of biomass, has been rising in recent years, and in the CPS it rises at the same pace to 2035 than over the last decade. Even so, average per capita consumption of emerging market and developing economies in 2035 (44 GJ/capita), remains well below the current global average of 54 GJ/capita. Figure 3.4 ⊳ Reductions in energy intensity and total final consumption by region in the CPS, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Over the next decade, reductions in energy intensity are smaller than recent years, while total final consumption increases at a faster rate in many regions Notes: GJ/capita = gigajoule per capita; C & S = Central and South America.

CC BY 4.0. 126 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Industry accounts for the largest share of growth in total final consumption, around 45%, with demand for base materials and other industrial outputs continuing to rise. The buildings sector is responsible for almost 30% of the increase, in particular reflecting increasing ownership of appliances and air conditioning. The transport sector accounts for more than 20%, in large part because of rapid rises in car ownership and freight transport in emerging market and developing economies. 3.3.1 Transport With rising demand for passenger and goods transport, especially in emerging market and developing economies, transport energy demand increases in the CPS by more than 10% through to 2035 (Figure 3.5). Oil currently accounts for 90% of transport energy consumption, and it continues to dominate energy use in the sector through to 2050. Electric car sales have surged in recent years as a result of policy support and declining battery prices. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to account for more than one-quarter of new cars sold worldwide in 2025, although uptake has slowed in the United States and Canada in the first\u0002half of 2025. In the CPS, the share of the market taken by EVs continues to rise, though not as rapid as in recent years, with EVs accounting for around 40% of the over 100 million passenger cars sold worldwide in 2035. China accounts for more than 50% of total electric cars sold globally in 2035, and Europe for another 30%. EV deployment is much more subdued elsewhere, with sales shares remaining close to current levels through to 2050. Increases in efficiency of conventional technologies – cars, trucks, aircraft and ships – also slow from historical levels, as the CPS assumes that standards are not strengthened any further after their specified policy period. Figure 3.5 ⊳ Energy demand in transport by fuel and economic grouping in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 127 3 Road transport The road transport sub-sector is responsible for around 45% of global oil use today, mostly used in passenger cars. Today there are around 1.4 billion cars on the road, and around 80 million new cars are sold each year. Rising demand for cars is concentrated in emerging market and developing economies, where the level of ownership, (one car per ten people), is much lower than in advanced economies, (five cars per ten people). This rise in demand takes the number of cars in emerging market and developing economies from nearly 0.7 billion today up to 1.3 billion in 2050, which is the largest source of energy demand growth in road transport. The size of new vehicles sold in recent years has grown. Sports utility vehicles (SUVs),1 which use about 15% more fuel than an average medium-size car, are now around 30% of the global car fleet and account for about 50% of all new car sales. Around 60% of new electric cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, though around 95% of the SUV fleet still runs on oil. Absent policies to limit the size and use of SUVs, their share of sales continues to rise in the CPS. Figure 3.6 ⊳ Fuel economy of new conventional cars and electric car sales by selected region/country in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Fuel economy of ICE cars slowly improves; electric car sales rise in China and the European Union, but are muted in other major car markets Note: ICE = internal combustion engine; Lge = litre of gasoline equivalent. Sources: Historical numbers for electric car sales are based on ACEA (2025); EV Volumes (2025); European Commission (2025); Marklines (2025). 1 The definition of an SUV varies by country. Here we include small SUVs, sometimes known as crossovers, as well as large SUVs such as those with off-road features. Crossovers are the most popular options in the European market.

CC BY 4.0. 128 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Today in China, two-thirds of electric cars on the market are cheaper to buy than their conventional equivalents. In other countries, measures such as subsidies and fuel economy standards have underpinned EV sales. In the CPS, electric car sales continue to rise in some markets: the vast majority of cars sold in the European Union in 2035 are electric as a result of existing CO2 standards, and around 90% of those sold in China are electric as a result of their low prices and operating costs (Figure 3.6). However, EV sales stall elsewhere, especially in regions that lack policy support or have limited charging infrastructure available. Globally, the market share of EVs rises from around 25% in 2025 to over 40% in 2035 in the CPS: it then falls slightly to 2050 as more global car sales take place in countries with relatively low EV adoption rates. Over the past decade, the fuel economy of new internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, (measured as fuel consumption per distance travelled), has improved in countries and regions with established policies, including China, European Union, Japan and United States. This reflects advances in gasoline and diesel engine technology together with widening use of hybrid vehicles. The rising share of heavier and less efficient vehicles, such as SUVs, however, has offset some of these gains. In the CPS, ICE car fuel economy continues to improve broadly in line with historical trends, though in some advanced economies it does so a little more slowly than in the past. Global total oil demand for passenger cars declines by more than 1 mb/d to 2035 in the CPS. An increase of 1.2 mb/d in emerging market and developing economies is more than offset by a 2.5 mb/d decline in advanced economies which reflects mainly fuel economy standards and zero emissions car mandates in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and Korea. Road freight is responsible for around 40% of road transport energy demand today, more than 90% of which is fuelled by oil.2 Global annual average fuel economy improvements for ICE heavy freight trucks slow to around 0.1% to 2035, down from 0.5% over the past ten years. Energy use in heavy freight trucks rises nearly 25% to 2035, which accounts for over 80% of the total growth in road freight energy demand. Electric heavy freight trucks accounted for just under 3% of global heavy freight trucks sold in 2024 and this rises to around 15% of global sales in 2035, mainly in China and the European Union (Figure 3.7). The growth of electric heavy freight trucks in these regions is driven by cost competitiveness in China and by CO2 standards in the European Union. Alternative powertrains such as hydrogen comprise a further 1% of global sales. Sales of LNG heavy freight trucks have been rising, mainly in China, where around 1 million were on the road in 2024. The market dipped slightly in the first-half of 2025, but in the CPS, the LNG heavy freight truck fleet more than doubles to 2035. 2 Road freight includes light commercial vehicles, which have a gross weight of less than 3.5 tonnes, medium freight trucks, which have a gross weight between 3.5 and 15 tonnes, and heavy freight trucks, which have a gross weight of more than 15 tonnes.

Aviation Aviation is a fast-growing sub-sector of transport: activity levels are up over 35% in the past decade. In the CPS, aviation activity increases by a further 50% to 2035. Around 80% of energy demand in aviation is for passenger transport; the rest is mainly for freight, military use and private flights. Increases are led by emerging market and developing economies, where its energy demand rises 4.2% per year to 2035, compared with around 1.5% in advanced economies (Figure 3.8). Soon after 2035, aviation demand in emerging market and developing economies rises to more than 7.5 trillion revenue passenger-kilometres each year, which is greater than the level in advanced economies. 3 Aviation activity swells 70% in China over the period and more than doubles in India. Aircraft fuel efficiency improved by around 2.5% per year on average over the last decade. Consequently the 35% increase in aviation demand over the period led to a much smaller increase of nearly 20% in energy demand. In the CPS, few new aircraft models are developed and introduced, and the annual average rate of improvement in aircraft fuel efficiency falls to 0.9% through to 2035. 3 Revenue passenger kilometres is a measure of airline passenger traffic, calculated by multiplying the number of paying passengers by the distance flown in kilometres. 10 20 30 40 50 2015 2024 2035 United States India China European Union Fuel economy of new ICE HFT sales Lge per 100 km 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 2015 2024 2035 Electric heavy freight truck sales share IEA. CC BY 4.0. 130 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 The use of biofuels and other sustainable aviation fuels has expanded in recent years, supported by policies such as ReFuelEU in the European Union, but oil still accounted for more than 99% of total aviation fuel consumption in 2024. The CPS sees some limited further expansion of sustainable aviation fuels, just under 60% of the current pipeline of projects are developed, and the share oil in the aviation fuel market stays above 95% to 2035. Oil use in aviation increases from 7 mb/d in 2024 to over 9 mb/d in 2035. Figure 3.8 ⊳ Aviation activity and energy demand by economic grouping and fuel in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. By 2035, aviation activity in emerging market and developing economies is similar to levels in advanced economies; global oil demand in aviation rises by 2 mb/d to 9 mb/d Note: RPK = revenue passenger kilometre; mb/d = million barrels per day; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Shipping and rail Shipping activity increased by almost 30% in the 2015 to 2024 period. Thanks in large part to efficiency gains, oil demand rose by much less, just under 5% to 5 mb/d in 2024. In the CPS, projected changes in patterns of trade mean that growth in shipping activity slows, but shipping tonne-kilometres still rise by a further 15% by 2035, and oil demand increases by another 3%. Although turnover in the shipping fleet remains gradual, more LNG-powered ships enter the fleet, and the fuel mix adjusts to meet the requirements of FuelEU maritime regulation in the European Union. As a result, the share of oil in shipping drops from more than 90% in 2024 to around 80% in 2035, and the share of LNG rises to nearly 15%. Some energy efficiency technologies that offer a positive return on investment are introduced for new ships. This leads to a 4% decline in shipping energy use per tonne-kilometre by 2035 in the CPS. Oil demand for rail rises by 2.5% to 2035 in the CPS to reach 0.6 mb/d.

In the CPS, minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and building codes are not strengthened beyond their current levels, and sales of more efficient appliances, such as heat pumps, remain flat to 2050 except in markets where they are already cost competitive without subsidy support. As a result, energy demand in the buildings sector increases by around 1.3% each year on average to 2035 in the CPS (Figure 3.9). Figure 3.9 ⊳ Energy demand in buildings by economic grouping and fuel in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity use in buildings increases rapidly in all regions, though fossil fuel use in the sector decreases in advanced economies Notes: EJ = exajoule; Other = non-renewable waste and hydrogen; Other renewables = solar thermal and geothermal. Buildings sector includes energy consumption for data centres and desalination. Nearly all of the growth in energy demand in the buildings sector is from emerging market and developing economies. There are large increases in demand for air conditioning and appliances in Southeast Asia, India and Africa, driven by socioeconomic development and rising temperatures. Although the efficiency of new air conditioners has increased by more than 3% annually since 2015, it does not improve further in the CPS because MEPS are not reinforced. Globally, electricity demand for space cooling climbs by almost 1 500 terawatt\u0002hours (TWh) by 2035. 30 60 90 120 2015 2024 2035 2050 2015 2024 2035 2050 Other Other renewables Modern bioenergy Traditional use of District heat Electricity Natural gas Oil Coal EJ biomass Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies IEA. CC BY 4.0. 132 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 In advanced economies, energy use in buildings fell an average of 0.3% per year over the last decade. This decline comes to an end in the CPS, and demand rises by 0.4% each year to 2035. Much of the increase stems from the use of electricity by artificial intelligence (AI) and data centres, notably in the United States. Some of it reflects the tendency of households to acquire larger appliances over time (e.g. televisions, refrigerators) and since the CPS sees no major change in efficiency standards, the larger appliances sold in 2035 in advanced economies consume more electricity than the ones sold today. Figure 3.10 ⊳ Change in activity and demand by end-use in the CPS between 2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Activity increases in all regions; all end-uses push up demand for both electricity and natural gas, notably for cooling, appliances and heating Notes: EU = European Union; C & S America = Central and South America; SE Asia = Southeast Asia. Activity driver for space cooling is air conditioner ownership. Coal use in the buildings sector has fallen by around 6% on average each year since 2015, and oil use by an annual average of 0.4%. In the CPS, their use declines at slightly faster rates to 2035, mostly as a result of a shift to other fuels in advanced economies and China. In contrast, natural gas demand in the buildings sector increases by around 0.7% on average each year to 2035, by when demand totals around 32 EJ (910 bcm). All of this increase is in emerging market and developing economies, where natural gas meets 45% of the increased demand for space and water heating, and cooking (Figure 3.10). In regions where networks are available or where countries have current plans to expand them, e.g. China, India and across much of Eurasia, natural gas helps to meet new energy service demand. In advanced economies, there is a 0.1% annual decline in natural gas use, lower than the 0.4% annual decline seen in the last decade. Since the CPS does not assume any increase in retrofit rates, further strengthening of mandatory building codes, or new gains from voluntary building codes, energy efficiency in buildings increases at a slower pace than it has done over the last decade. 25% 50% 75% 100% Electricity Natural gas Space heating Water heating Cooking Appliances Space cooling Other Demand growth by end-use and fuel 25% 50% 75% 100% North EU China Middle East C & S SE Asia India Africa America America Activity growth by end-use and region 195% 305% 125% IEA.

Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 133 3 Electricity demand in the buildings sector increased by 2.6% each year on average over the last ten years, and this rises to an average of 3.2% over the next decade in the CPS. Space cooling and appliances contribute 60% of the growth in demand. In emerging market and developing economies, electricity use increases by close to 400 TWh per year to 2035, accounting for more than 90% of the total increase in energy demand in buildings; the number of appliances increases by 35% to 2035, and the number of air conditioning units increases by 70%; the new air conditioners purchased are on average about 20% less efficient than those in advanced economies. In advanced economies, rising demand for AI and other information technology services push electricity consumption in data centres to increase by an annual average of 50 TWh to 2035, while space cooling and appliances increase annual electricity demand in buildings by a further 45 TWh each year. Figure 3.11 ⊳ Efficiency improvements of key end-uses and demand for heating services by fuel in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Slower increases in efficiency improvements for appliances and cooling equipment mean faster growth in energy demand in buildings In the CPS, the global average annual increase in equipment efficiency in the buildings sector falls from 1.2% over the last decade to 0.7% through to 2035 (Figure 3.11). Much of the efficiency gain that occurs in the CPS stems from natural turnover, as the existing stock of equipment and appliances is gradually renewed with new and often more efficient models. Only space heating efficiency increases above historical trends as heat pump sales rise in markets where such systems are already cost competitive (mostly air-to-air heat pumps in China and the United States), helping electricity to account for a rising share of total energy use for heating in buildings. While air-to-water heat pumps can offer similar costs to gas boilers over their lifetimes, current policies are not sufficient to persuade many households to accept the higher upfront costs that they entail, and sales remain flat. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% Space heating Water heating Cooling Appliances 2015-2024 2024-2035 Average annual increase in efficiency 20% 40% 60% 80% 2015 2024 2035 Fossil fuels Electricity District heating Renewables Share of heating service demand IEA. CC BY 4.0. 134 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 3.3.3 Industry Energy demand in the industry sector increased by 1.3% each year on average over the past ten years. In the CPS, recycling rates for plastics and aluminium increase at a slower rate than over the past decade, and industrial facilities invest in efficiency projects only if they have a short payback period. In addition, there is limited switching to electricity, infrastructure development is delayed, and funds from industrial financing support schemes are only disbursed if they are already earmarked. So, for example, the USD 1.1 billion auction for industrial decarbonisation from the EU Clean Industrial Deal is not disbursed. As a result, continued growth in demand for basic materials and industrial products drives a 1.5% average annual increase in energy use to 2035 in the CPS (Figure 3.12). Figure 3.12 ⊳ Energy demand in industry by fuel in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Increasing activity and slower reductions in energy intensity lead to substantial industrial energy demand growth, with demand for virtually all fuels rising to 2035 In emerging market and developing economies, energy demand in industry rises by 1.8% per year on average to 2035 as activity increases. Advanced economies see an average annual increase of around 0.6% to 2035 as industry gradually recovers from the suppressed demand levels seen after the Covid-19 pandemic and the global energy crisis. Coal use in industry rises marginally between 2024 and 2035 in the CPS, but remains well below its 2014 peak: increased materials production fuelled by coal in many emerging market and developing economies is almost offset by declining demand in advanced economies and China. Oil demand in industry increases by 2.1% per year to 2035, up from 1.9% per year since 2015, mainly for use in petrochemicals. Natural gas demand rises by 2% on average per year to 2035, and electricity demand by 1.9%, in both economy groupings mainly as a result of demand from rapidly growing non-energy-intensive industries, especially the machinery sub-sector. 50 100 150 200 250 2015 2024 2035 2050 Other Bioenergy and waste Electricity Natural gas Oil feedstock Oil Coal By fuel EJ 2015 2024 2035 2050 Other industry Paper Non-ferrous metals Chemicals Non-metallic minerals Iron and steel By sector IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 135 3 Energy intensity, measured per unit of value added, of the global industry sector decreases by around 1.2% each year to 2035 in the CPS, compared with a 1.1% annual reduction over the past decade. This stems mostly from a continuation of the global structural shift towards higher value added and less energy-intensive industries, rather than from efficiency gains: there is only a limited increase in global average recycling ratesfor most materialsin the CPS, and the reduction of clinker use in cement manufacturing only advances marginally. All sub\u0002sectors contribute to the increase in global energy demand in industry to 2035 in the CPS, but the chemicals and non-energy-intensive industries together account for around 85% of the total (Figure 3.13). Figure 3.13 ⊳ Industrial production growth by region/country and contribution of sub-sectors to energy demand growth in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chemicals and non-energy-intensive industries in emerging market and developing economies drive energy demand growth in industry Note: SE Asia = Southeast Asia; C & S America = Central and South America; AE = advanced economies. Petrochemical production rises by around 30% to 2035, mainly in emerging market and developing economies, notably China, India, and some countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. A number of countries have announced targets to increase recycling rates or restrict single-use plastics. In the CPS, these measures are not strengthened after their implementation deadlines, and the global average plastics collection rate, 19% in 2024, rises only marginally to 21% in 2035. The share of non-energy-intensive production in total industrial energy demand increased from around 29% in 2015 to 30% today. It rises to around 32% in 2035 in the CPS. Non\u0002energy-intensive industries include sub-sectors such as machinery, textiles and food processing, all of which are growing rapidly.

Box 3.1 ⊳ Switching growth engines for energy-intensive materials: other countries take the lead as China shifts gear China accounted for more than half of the global energy demand growth in the industry sector since 2015, of which more than 75% is in its energy-intensive industries. More recently, lower domestic material demand slowed the rate of growth in some energy\u0002intensive sub-sectors and caused industrial production in others to peak. For example, with a slowdown in its real estate sector, cement production fell by more than 25% in 2024 from its peak in 2014. It continues to decline in the CPS, but per capita cement demand in China remains far above the level seen today in advanced economies in Asia. Steel production in China peaked in 2020, and it too is set to fall further to 2035. As a result of such changes, in the CPS, energy demand in energy-intensive industries in China rises by just 0.3% each year on average to 2035, well below the 2% annual increase seen over the past decade, and its industrial coal use falls by around 1.6% per year (Figure 3.14). Figure 3.14 ⊳ Energy demand of energy-intensive industries, and industrial production in selected sub-sectors in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. As industry in China moves towards higher value production, other emerging market and developing economies start to drive growth in energy-intensive industries Note: Chemicals = primary chemicals production; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.

In the CPS, they account for almost two-thirds of global demand growth in industry to 2035, of which most is in energy-intensive industries. India and Southeast Asia contribute almost half of the global growth: for example, around a quarter of currently announced new steel plant capacity is located in these regions, and steel production there almost doubles by 2035. 3.4 Electricity 3.4.1 Demand Global electricity demand rose 2.9% on average each year over the last decade. China accounted for two-thirds of this growth. Demand for electricity also grew rapidly in India and Southeast Asia, both of which registered annual average growth rates of over 5%. In the CPS, global electricity demand increases by 3% per year to 2035 (Figure 3.15). Some countries and regions, including Japan and the European Union, have seen a plateau or decline in electricity consumption over the last decade, but this changes: in the CPS, every region sees growth in electricity demand to 2035. Figure 3.15 ⊳ Electricity demand by region/country in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity demand per capita rises to 2035 in all regions, and global electricity demand increases rapidly, predominately in emerging market and developing economies Note: MWh = megawatt-hour; TWh = terawatt-hour; C & S America = Central and South America. Global electricity demand increases by almost 1 000 TWh each year to 2035 in the CPS, which is roughly equivalent to adding Japan’s current total demand every year. Demand from appliances and cooling equipment account for 30% of the global increase, reflecting boosts in appliance ownership and in average temperatures.

Industry accounts for 25% of the increase. New uses of electricity, such as EVs and data centres, contribute a further 20% increase: demand for such uses is largely concentrated in advanced economies and China (Figure 3.16). Figure 3.16 ⊳ Electricity demand by end-use, 2024-2050, and demand growth by end-use in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity demand increases by almost 1 000 TWh each year, mostly driven by appliances, cooling and industry Notes: Other buildings include electric space and water heating excluding heat pumps, lighting, cooking, desalination and data centres. Other includes agriculture, non-road transport and other energy sector. Today, electricity demand per capita in advanced economies is almost three-times higher than in emerging market and developing economies: higher incomes tend to increase residential electricity consumption, and advanced economies in general rely heavily on electricity for their economic output. Increases in efficiency and slow growth or declining production in certain industries have tempered the increase in electricity demand in advanced economies over the past decade. Yet, new sources of demand such as EVs, AI and data centres mean that demand in advanced economies rises in the CPS by around 200 TWh in aggregate each year to 2035. Electricity demand in emerging market and developing economies increases by much more, surging by around 750 TWh each year to 2035. It increases by 50% between 2024 and 2035 in China, where electricity consumption increases to 10 megawatt-hours (MWh) per capita – a higher level than in Japan and Europe. India has the fastest rate of growth of any region, with an increase in demand of 80% to 2035, driven by the rising use of air conditioners and appliances: despite this, it still has one of the lowest rates of electricity demand per capita among major economies in 2035.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 139 3 increase is in Indonesia, which sees a 70% increase in demand for electricity in the CPS, for broadly similar reasons as in India. Electricity demand growth in the CPS stems mainly from population increases and higher levels of economic activity, e.g. a 50% increase in the stock of air conditioning units, a 20% increase in floorspace in buildings, and a 35% increase in industrial value added. The electrification of end-uses that have previously relied on other fuels, notably the uptake of EVs in Europe and China, also contributes to more demand for electricity. Efficiency gains, notably in appliances, housing and industry, reduce overall growth in electricity demand to 2035 by around 15% in the CPS. Electrification and efficiency gains are strongest in advanced economies, while in emerging market and developing economies, their impact is marginal relative to the impact of increased activity (Figure 3.17). Figure 3.17 ⊳ Annual average growth in electricity demand by economic grouping, driver and sector in the CPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Most growth in electricity demand reflects higher activity; increased electrification boosts demand while efficiency gains subdue it, but both have a relatively minor impact Note: TWh = terawatt-hours; Elec. = electrification; Other includes agriculture and other energy sector. 3.4.2 Electricity generation Over the past five years, annual capacity additions of solar PV and wind expanded by 30% per year. Both technologies remain competitive in many markets in the CPS, and an average of almost 700 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity is added each year to 2035 – about 5% more than the amount added in 2024 – but the pace of growth slows.

Coal-fired power generation increases in the near term and remains the largest source of electricity through to 2035 in the CPS. Natural gas remains the second-largest source of electricity into the 2030s, and its use continues to rise through to 2050 in the CPS, providing both bulk power and flexibility in many markets. Nuclear output meanwhile rises by about 35% to 2035 and over 80% by 2050 as over 40 countries have policies in place to expand their use of nuclear power (Figure 3.18). Figure 3.18 ⊳ Global electricity generation by source in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Coal and natural gas continue as the bedrock of global electricity supply into the 2030s, complemented by a nuclear comeback and fast deployment of renewables Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour; CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Other renewables include bioenergy and renewable waste, concentrating solar power, geothermal and marine. Other includes oil, non\u0002renewable waste and other sources. In advanced economies, electricity demand growth through to 2035 is met in the CPS primarily by solar PV, wind, and nuclear (Figure 3.19). This is despite recent policy changes that lead to a notable reduction in the pace of solar PV deployment in the United States compared with 2024 levels. Solar PV sees the largest increase in electricity generation in advanced economies to 2035, followed closely by wind mainly because of robust growth in the European Union. Geothermal energy for power generation in advanced economies expands by more than 50% to 2035, led by its further development in the United States (IEA, 2024a). Nuclear power meets more than 10% of demand growth, supported by reactor restarts in Japan and new units in the United States, Japan, Korea and France. Natural gas plays an important role to meet electricity demand growth in the United States in the CPS, notably to provide power for data centres.

Coal-fired generation falls by 40% over the period to 2035, continuing its long-term decline. From 2035 to 2050, nuclear and renewables each expand by over one-third, while natural gas declines by about 10% and coal by nearly 35%, further shifting the generation mix toward low-emissions sources.

Nuclear and renewables expand to meet most new demand in advanced economies; virtually all sources of generation expand in emerging market and developing economies Notes: TWh = terawatt-hours; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Other renewables include bioenergy and renewable waste, concentrating solar power, geothermal and marine. Other includes oil, non-renewable waste and other sources. In emerging market and developing economies, rapid electricity demand growth is met by expanding the use of virtually all sources of electricity. Solar PV accounts for half of the total increase in electricity generation to 2035: much of the new capacity is located in China – the global leader in solar manufacturing – and India (IEA, 2024b). Wind accounts for about 20% of the increase in electricity supply, and nuclear power for just over 5%, with China again in the lead in terms of capacity additions for both technologies. Coal-fired generation peaks before 2030 but it remains the largest source of electricity until 2040. Natural gas-fired generation increases by more than 45% from 2024 to 2035, meeting a sizable portion of new electricity demand.

CC BY 4.0. 142 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Fossil fuels accounted for nearly 60% of global electricity generation in 2024, compared with 66% in 2015. In the CPS, fossil fuel generation increases by 5% to 2035, but its share of total generation continues to decline, falling to around 40% in 2035 and 30% by 2050 (Figure 3.20). The share of coal-fired power declines steadily over time, and the share of oil continues to fall; the share of natural gas remains close to 20% through 2035. Figure 3.20 ⊳ Electricity generation by source and region/country in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Gas-fired generation continues to expand, particularly in emerging market and developing economies, while coal generation peaks before 2030 and oil continues to decline Note: TWh = terawatt-hours; C & S America = Central and South America. Coal-fired power generation is projected to peak before 2030, and in 2035 it is around 5% below 2024 levels, asrobust electricity demand in several of itslargest markets – China, India and Southeast Asia – is offset by declinesin coal generation elsewhere. In China, coal remains its largest source of electricity to 2035, though by then its overall share of generation is in decline as the deployment of additional solar PV, wind and nuclear power outpaces electricity demand growth. In India, coal-fired generation rises in the near term before reaching a plateau by 2035 as renewables and nuclear advance. In Southeast Asia, coal use continues to grow to support economic development and rising demand. Meanwhile, several advanced economies, including Canada and many member states of the European Union, are on track to phase out unabated coal by 2035 in favour of renewables, nuclear and natural gas. In addition, Japan and Korea reduce unabated coal-fired generation to 2035 in the CPS. Natural gas remains a key contributor to global electricity supply growth in the CPS, though regional trends diverge. The United States generates more electricity from gas today than any other country, and that continues to be the position through to 2050.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 143 3 remains the second-largest user of gas-fired electricity to 2035, with gas use increasing in order to meet rising demand and to displace oil-fired generation. Major growth is also projected in China, Southeast Asia, Africa and India, where natural gas helps meet rising electricity demand. In Japan, natural gas rises 15% to 2035 before reaching a plateau. In contrast, countries such as Canada and Korea reduce gas-fired generation as its role shifts from bulk supply to the provision of system flexibility. Oil-fired power generation in the CPS remains heavily concentrated in the Middle East, which accounts for around 40% of the global total through to 2035, even though Saudi Arabia and several other countries in the region are actively reducing oil use in the power sector to free up supply for export. In Africa, oil continues to play a major role to provide electricity access, particularly in remote areas through mini-grids and off-grid systems (see Chapter 6). While many countries around the world are working to phase out oil in power generation, its use persists in remote areas where alternatives remain limited or costly to deploy. Renewables increase from one-third of global power generation in 2024 to nearly half by 2035 in the CPS. Solar PV and wind continue to expand, but they face mounting integration challenges in the CPS in the absence of additional government policies, which slow their deployment. Annual solar PV capacity additions average 540 GW to 2035, holding steady at roughly the 2024 level, and halting the trend that has seen deployment rise ten-fold from 2015 to 2024. Annual wind capacity additions average about 150 GW to 2035, which is 30% above the level in 2024, largely thanks to the pipeline of wind projects in the European Union; while many other markets, including the United States, see deployment stagnate.

CC BY 4.0. 144 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 The rising share of variable renewables in the power mix of many countries alters the operational dynamics of power systems, increasing the need for flexibility, storage and enhanced grid management (see Chapter 5). Ensuring that sufficient dispatchable capacity4 is available to meet hours of peak electricity demand is critical to overall electricity system security. Nearly all dispatchable sources of electricity increase to 2035 in the CPS (Figure 3.21). Coal-fired power is the largest dispatchable source of electricity in the world today, with over 9 000 units in operation in close to 80 countries, over 280 GW of additional coal-fired power units are currently under construction around the world, including over 200 GW in China, and many more coal plants are at the planning stage. In the CPS, global coal-fired capacity additions average almost 55 GW per yearto 2035, which is one-third more than additions in 2024, while capacity additions of other dispatchable sources of electricity accelerate, including gas-fired power, hydropower, nuclear and geothermal power, which is set to benefit from recent advances in drilling and stimulation techniques (Box 3.2). Battery storage is the fastest growing power technology, averaging 90% market growth over the past five years: around 135 GW of new battery capacity is added per year to 2035 in the CPS, 75% above the level of deployment in 2024. Box 3.2 ⊳ Nuclear power is making a comeback Several prominent nuclear energy projects in the United States and Europe face project delays and cost overruns, and the industry is still grappling with various public concerns, notably about long-term waste disposal challenges. Yet momentum for nuclear power is building, driven by concerns about rising CO2 emissions or energy security, or both. Over 40 countries now include nuclear in their energy strategies and have taken concrete steps to develop new projects. Investment in nuclear power is rising. A record high in nuclear power output is expected in 2025. Technology advances – particularly in small modular reactors – are improving the outlook for nuclear power (IEA, 2025). As demand surges and the need for reliable, low-emissions baseload electricity increases, nuclear is increasingly seen as a critical part of a secure, affordable and diverse electricity mix. Global nuclear power capacity increases by three-quartersfrom the current level by 2050 in the CPS, as the current pipeline of projects helps raise deployment in the 2030s to levels not seen since the 1980s (Figure 3.22). China leads the way, having steadily built up its nuclear supply chain to enable it to deliver a stream of new reactor projects. China accounts for close to half of all nuclear capacity under construction today, and is on track to become the world’s largest nuclear power operator around 2030. In the United States, recent policy developments are revitalising the nuclear industry after nearly three decades of limited construction, supported by strong interest from technology companies in developing small modular reactors to provide power to data centres. US nuclear capacity begins increasing by 2035 in the CPS, and expands by over 80% by 2050. 4 Dispatchable sources of electricity are generally available around-the-clock and can be controlled or scheduled to meet demand. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 145 3 In Europe, nuclear power is increasingly viewed as essential to achieve both energy security and climate goals: several countries, including France, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Sweden, have established policies, agreements with vendors and project plans, and are securing investment to start, expand or restart nuclear construction activities. Efforts to diversify the nuclear fuel supply are also underway in the United States, Europe and China. Figure 3.22 ⊳ Nuclear power capacity and capacity additions by region/country in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Global nuclear power capacity increases by 75% to 2050 as a growing number of countries aim to bolster electricity security and diversify their electricity mixes Note: GW = gigawatt; C & S America = Central and South America. 3.4.3 Electricity grids Status of grids today Grids are the backbone of electricity systems, serving as the bridge between power generation and end-use demand. They are essential to deliver secure and affordable electricity to consumers, support economic development and enable the evolution of electricity systems. Without resilient and modern electricity grids, achieving policy goals, such as providing sufficient volumes of secure, affordable and low-emissions electricity, or expanding electricity access, would remain out of reach. Today’s global electricity networks stretch more than 84 million kilometres (km) – nearly 52 million km in emerging market and developing economies, and over 32 million km in advanced economies (Figure 3.23). Over the past decade, global transmission grids have expanded by nearly 30% to almost 6 million km. Most of this expansion has been in emerging market and developing economies, where total line length increased by almost 40%, compared with 8% in advanced 300 600 900 1990200020102020203020402050 North America European Union Japan and Korea China Southeast Asia C & S America Middle East Africa Installed capacity GW India Rest of world 10 20 30 1970s1980s1990s2000s2010s 2020s2030s 2040s Average annual capacity additions IEA. CC BY 4.0. 146 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 economies. Grids have expanded in lockstep with electricity demand, which rose 30% worldwide over the last decade, over 50% in emerging market and developing economies, and 4% in advanced economies. Electricity demand in China surged by 80%, spurring the construction of an additional 490 000 km of lines, over one-third of the global transmission network increase. Fast-growing electricity demand in other emerging market and developing economies led to the length of transmission systems increasing by 75% in Indonesia, 60% in India and 45% in Africa. By contrast, advanced economies, where electricity demand was more stable, extended their transmission grids by 120 000 km in aggregate. The United States added just 2% to its total, while the European Union enlarged its grid by over 10%, driven less by rising electricity demand than by the need to connect new variable renewables, which are often sited far from existing lines. Figure 3.23 ⊳ Global electrical grids by region/country and type, and growth rates by region, 2015-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity networks expand in all regions, creating opportunities for modernisation to support evolving power systems Note: km = kilometres; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Distribution grids have experienced similar growth patterns over the past decade. Driven by rising electricity demand, they have increased rapidly in emerging market and developing economies. In India, grids extended by more than 50%, by 4.6 million km, and in China by around one-third, by 2.2 million km. They have nearly doubled in Indonesia, which has added nearly 0.8 million km of additional lines, connecting many households and other customers for the first time. Mature distribution systems in advanced economies have seen modest additions as well, with an increase of close to 10% in both the United States and European Union, together totalling 1.8 million km. 30 60 90 2015 2024 Distribution Transmission Distribution Transmission Grid length Million km EMDE: Advanced economies: 2% 4% 6% United States European Union China India Middle East Southeast Asia World Average annual growth rate 2015-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 147 3 Electrical grids face several challenges. These include regional congestion, supply chain bottlenecks, public opposition and siting challenges. The risk of delay in grid expansion is evidenced in the growing interconnection queues: some 2 800 GW of solar and wind projects, more than half of them at an advanced stage, are waiting for a connection. Meanwhile, demand hotspots such as data centre clusters can strain local grids: in parts of the United States, they already draw over 10% of electricity demand, and in Ireland around 20%. Another pressing issue is ageing of grid assets, particularly in advanced economies. Older grids tend to be more vulnerable to faults and to require investment to extend their operational lifetimes. Large parts of the transmission and distribution networks in Europe and North America date back to the mid-twentieth century: only around 20% of the grid infrastructure is less than ten years old, while more than 50% has been in service for more than twenty years. In emerging market and developing economies, in contrast, roughly 40% of the grid infrastructure was commissioned in the last decade, and around 35% is more than twenty years old (Figure 3.24). Figure 3.24 ⊳ Grid length by type, age and region/country, 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Many advanced economies have ageing grid infrastructure in need of modernisation, emerging market and developing economies have newer grids Purchase and installation of new power lines and transformers are costly, involve long lead times and require complex planning. Faced with these challenges, grid operators have tended to opt for digital and power electronic upgrades rather than new lines in recent years, especially in advanced economies. Flexible alternating current transmission systems, known as FACTS, especially enhanced static synchronous compensators, known as STATCOMs, can provide fast, dynamic reactive power that stabilises voltage and short-term inertia during periods of high variable renewable electricity generation and free up additional transmission capacity. At the same time, tools such as dynamic line rating can increase thermal limits in United States European Union China India Southeast Asia Middle East World Less than 10 years old Between 10 and 20 years old Older than 20 years Transmission 50% 100% 50% 100% Distribution IEA. CC BY 4.0. 148 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 real time, and large-scale monitoring and control systems can provide comprehensive visibility of what is happening in grid systems, optimise the use of existing assets, prevent cascading power outages, and accelerate system restoration if needed. Grid operators are also making use of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technology, which has become essential for modern grid operations. HVDC can transport large amounts of electricity over long distances and offers complete bidirectional flow control and valuable black start capability. Its use has increased notably in parallel with the growth of offshore wind farms, which are often connected via HVDC links because of their remote locations. HVDC can also connect national grids in neighbouring countries or geographic regions, helping them to pool reserves, balance renewable energy variability, and reduce the overall capacity required to ensure reliability. Grid expansion and replacement Grid systems need to develop in tandem as electricity systems expand to provide electricity to new demand centres and to connect new generation sources. In the CPS, global electricity grids increase by 25 million km from 2024 to 2035, becoming 30% more extensive than today, and by a further 40 million km to 2050. Increasing electricity demand is responsible for over 90% of total grid expansion to 2050. Most of this is in emerging market and developing economies, which in aggregate add over 20 million km to their grids by 2035. China accounts for close to 40% of this total, extending its grid to 2035 by nearly three-times as much as advanced economies combined (Figure 3.25). Figure 3.25 ⊳ Expansion of grid lines by driver in selected region/country in the CPS, 2024-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Most new lines are installed to meet increased demand; nearly 90% of all new lines are in emerging market and developing economies Note: AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. 3 6 9 2024 2030 2040 2050 United States European Union Other AE Million km Advanced economies 20 40 60 2024 2030 2040 2050 China India Southeast Asia Middle East Other EMDE Emerging market and developing economies Increased demand Renewables IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 149 3 Grid expansions are also driven by the deployment of variable renewables such as solar PV and wind, which are often located far from demand centres. Connecting additional variable renewables in advanced economies requires a half million km of new lines; connecting them in emerging market and developing economies, many of which have less developed grids, requires 1.5 million km of new lines by 2050 in the CPS. However, all electricity network projects, especially high voltage interconnections, are complex in terms of both permitting and construction. Line route plans and reports have to be drawn up covering the entire length, conditions and specifications have to be assessed, and stakeholders need to be engaged. People living near the proposed line routes may oppose their development. Longer distances between power generation and demand centres and other technical issues can make high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission attractive in some cases, especially for connecting offshore wind farms. A growing number of electricity network lines and cables will need to be replaced or refurbished in the years ahead as they reach the end of their typical lifetime of around 40 years. In some areas, such as Germany, the distribution grid is mostly underground, and extensive ground works will be needed for replacement. In others, such as the United States, the widespread use of more accessible overhead lines means that line replacement planning primarily involves tasks such as replacing masts and conductors, without the need for extensive earthworks. Figure 3.26 ⊳ Grid line replacement by selected region/country and replacement share of grid additions in the CPS, 2024-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. More than 45 million km of grid line are replaced by 2050, accounting for 40% of all cumulative grid additions, of which more than two-thirds are in advanced economies Note: AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. In the CPS, grid line replacements worldwide total nearly 20 million km by 2035.

CC BY 4.0. 150 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 States and Europe, and over 25 million km in emerging market and developing economies. In all cases, 90% of the replacements are for distribution lines (Figure 3.26). Replacements account for over two-thirds of all grid additions in advanced economies, where future grid expansion is limited and the existing grid network is ageing. In emerging market and developing economies, where the existing grids are newer and expanding rapidly, replacements comprise about 30% of total grid additions to 2050. Grid investment needs Global investment in electricity transmission and distribution networks is set to continue to increase in the years ahead, driven by rising electricity demand and changes in the generation mix. Annual spending on grids rose by 2.5% a year on average between 2013 and 2024, increasing from under USD 300 billion to nearly USD 390 billion in 2024. In the CPS, it is projected to increase at 5% a year on average through to 2035, with annual grid-related investment spending reaching about USD 650 billion in 2035. Figure 3.27 ⊳ Average annual grid investment by economic grouping in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Grid investment rises in nearly all regions to modernise and expand transmission and distribution to meet rising electricity demand and to connect new sources of generation Note: MER = market exchange rate. Advanced economies and China have largely driven recent growth in grid investment. In the United States, investment in grid infrastructure more than doubled to nearly USD 110 billion between 2013 and 2024, supported by federal incentives and streamlined permitting processes. The European Union saw a 60% rise over the same period to nearly USD 70 billion, much of which was focused on the integration of variable renewables and cross-border grid development (Figure 3.27). China invested more than USD 80 billion in grids in 2024. 200 400 600 800 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025- 2030 2031- 2035 2036- 2050 Billion USD (2024, MER) Transmission Distribution blank blank Transmission Distribution Emerging market and developing economies Advanced economies IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 151 3 However, investment in emerging market and developing economies as a whole, excluding China, has declined by over 10% in recent years, despite rising electricity demand. Annual spending has increased in Africa by around USD 4 billion from 2013 levels, but it has contracted in Southeast Asia and India by 15% and 8% respectively. The picture needs to change. Grid investment in China more than doubles by 2035 in the CPS, as electricity demand continues to rise and renewables growth is much higher over the next decade than they were the last ten years. Investment in other emerging market and developing economies, which have recently lagged, nearly doubles to USD 160 billion annually by 2035, increasing at an annual rate of about 6%. By the mid-2030s, roughly two\u0002thirds of global grid investment is in emerging market and developing economies. Grid investment levels in advanced economies in the CPS, which have risen at a relatively rapid rate in recent years, stay at elevated levels and increase at an annual rate of around 2%, rising from USD 220 billion in 2024 to USD 275 billion in 2035. The rapid expansion of investment in electricity networks is already straining supply chains. Lead times for large power transformers and high-voltage cables have nearly doubled in many regions and wait times for HVDC systems stretch into the 2030s. Prices for key materials such as copper and aluminium remain high. European cable manufacturers are operating at full capacity, with order books committed for the next several years due to strong demand from interconnection and offshore wind projects. Labour shortages, especially of skilled technicians, engineers and project managers, alongside permitting hurdles, are also causing considerable delays and driving up costs. 3.5 Fossil fuels Oil and natural gas demand increase by 16% to 2035 and continue to rise through to 2050 (Figure 3.28). Their prices also generally rise over this period. Oil demand in 2050 is 113 mb/d and natural gas demand is 5 600 bcm. To meet this demand, high levels of new resource development are necessary together with new fossil fuel infrastructure such as upstream facilities, pipelines, export and import terminals, and ships. The CPS also assumes that, by the latter part of the projection period, constraints on oil production and trade in countries currently subject to sanctions ease, so their output is determined by the underlying economics. This brings additional potential sources of supply into the picture, but their availability cannot be taken for granted if geopolitical constraints remain in place. Oil remains the dominant fuel to 2050 in the CPS. China accounted for more than 75% of oil demand growth over the past ten years, but this picture is changing, and India becomes the new epicentre of growth in oil demand. Half of the increase in demand for natural gas to 2035 isfrom the power and industry sectors in emerging market and developing economies in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. The global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1 020 bcm in IEA. CC BY 4.0. 152 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 2050. By 2035, the United States is both the world’s largest natural gas consumer at just over 1 000 bcm and the world’s largest LNG exporter at 250 bcm. Coal use starts to decline globally before 2030, and by 2035 demand is around 8% lower than in 2024. Coal use in advanced economies declines by 35% to 2035 and it declines by 10% in China as renewable electricity expands and coal use in industry falls, although this drop is partially offset by continued growth in coal demand in other emerging market and developing economies. Figure 3.28 ⊳ Fossil fuel demand in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Oil and natural gas demand continue to rise to 2050; coal use falls, mainly as a result of reductions in the power sector in China and advanced economies Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; tce = tonne of coal equivalent. 3.5.1 Oil Demand Global demand for oil was 100 mb/d in 2024. In the CPS, it rises to 105 mb/d in 2035 and 113 mb/d in 2050, an average annual increase of around 0.5 mb/d (Figure 3.29). The largest increases to 2035 are for oil use as petrochemical feedstock and other industrial activities, and in aviation. Demand in road transport in 2035 is similar to levels in 2024: by 2035, there are 430 million electric cars on the road worldwide – 60% of which are in China and 25% in Europe – and these avoid more than 6 mb/d of oil demand. Oil use for power generation falls by 2 mb/d to 2035, led by declines in countries in the Middle East. Nearly all of the growth in oil demand takes place in emerging market and developing economies, with some of the largest increases coming in India, Southeast Asia and Africa, and there is a continued decline in oil use in advanced economies. China accounted for more than 75% of oil demand growth globally between 2015 and 2024, but the outlook for its future is changing with the rapid electrification of its vehicle fleet and 20 40 60 80 100 120 2000 2050 Oil (mb/d) Natural gas (thousand bcm) Coal (billion tce) 1 2 3 4 5 6 2000 2050 1 2 3 4 5 6 2024 2000 2024 2050 2024 Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies International bunkers IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 153 3 its gradual shift to a less energy-intensive form of economic growth (Figure 3.30). Total oil demand in China falls slightly from around 16.2 mb/d in 2024 to 15.8 mb/d in 2035, mainly as a result of reduced oil use in road transport, although a large portion of this decline is offset by increased oil use as petrochemical feedstock. Figure 3.29 ⊳ Global oil demand by sector and economic grouping in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Global oil demand rises to 105 mb/d in 2035 and 113 mb/d in 2050 led by increases in petrochemical feedstock and aviation Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; Other industries = industry sector excluding petrochemicals; Other = other non-energy use, other energy sectors, power, agriculture and other transport. Excludes biofuels. India leads global oil demand growth over the next ten years, with almost half of the additional barrels produced globally to 2035 heading in its direction. Its oil use increases from 5.5 mb/d in 2024 to 8 mb/d in 2035 as a result of rapid growth in car ownership, increasing demand for plastics, chemicals and aviation, and a rise in the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking. Oil demand in Africa rises by one-third to around 6 mb/d in 2035. Road transport accounts for about three-quarters of the increase, while oil use in the buildings sector – mainly in the form of LPG to replace the use of traditional solid biomass – also rises marginally, as does oil use in aviation and industry. Oil demand in the Middle East was around 8.5 mb/d in 2024 and increases by close to 1 mb/d to 2035 in the CPS. There is limited uptake of electric cars, partly because many countries in the region subsidise the use of gasoline and diesel, and efforts to expand the oil-to-chemicals value chain cause oil use as petrochemical feedstock to rise substantially. Increases in demand are partially offset by a 1 mb/d drop in oil use in power, mainly as a result of current policy plans in Saudi Arabia. 30 60 90 120 2000 2035 2050 Cars Road freight Aviation Petrochemicals Other industries Buildings mb/d Shipping Other By sector 2024 20 40 60 80 2000 2035 2050 Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies By region 2024 IEA.

Other = aviation, other industries, shipping, other non-energy use, other energy sectors, agriculture and other transport. Oil demand in advanced economies falls by around 3.5 mb/d to 2035, but there are large differences between countries. Around 80% of the drop occurs in Europe, and there are also reductions in Japan and Korea, Canada, and Australia and New Zealand, mainly as a result of current road transport electrification and space heating policies. Oil demand in other advanced economies increases slightly to 2035: there are some reductions of oil use in passenger cars as older cars are gradually replaced by more efficient versions, but these are more than offset by increases in freight transport and oil use as petrochemical feedstock. Supply Between 2015 and 2024, the United States increased supply by 8 mb/d while global oil demand increased by 6.5 mb/d (Figure 3.31). Meeting the rise in oil demand in the CPS to 2050 requires contributions from a much wider range of supply sources. This includes more output from countries currently under sanctions, a willingness among low-cost producers to expand beyond announced capacity limits, and a substantial rise in oil prices to incentivise new exploration and development in higher cost regions. Non-OPEC+ supply rises by 4 mb/d to 2035 – three quarters of the increase in global oil demand over this period – led by increases in the United States, Canada, Guyana, Brazil and Argentina. Supply then falls back to 2024 levels by 2050. US oil supply reached a record high of 21 mb/d in 2024, and it increases by 0.8 mb/d to 2035 in the CPS.

In Canada, oil supply increases from 6.1 mb/d in 2024 by 0.8 mb/d to 2035, driven mainly by debottlenecking oil sands operations and rising NGLs output from shale plays. Higher prices and expanding pipeline trade with the United States support a new wave of large-scale mining and in-situ extra-heavy oil and bitumen projects after 2035. Offshore production in Guyana rises from 0.6 mb/d in 2024 by 1.2 mb/d to 2035, with further increases thereafter, reliant on further exploration success. Output in Brazil increases by from 3.5 mb/d in 2024 by 1 mb/d to 2035, despite some delays in the commissioning of new floating production storage and offloading units. Output in Argentina rises to 1.4 mb/d in 2035, its highest level ever, driven by tight oil development in the Vaca Muerta formation. Suriname’s first offshore barrels are assumed to come online in 2028 from the Sapakara and Krabdagu fields, and to be followed by additional developments. Africa produced more than 7 mb/d of oil in 2024. Production dips slightly to 2035, and then picks up again to 7 mb/d in 2050 in the CPS. Several countries in Africa, including Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Cameroon and Angola, have launched new licensing rounds and are revising fiscal terms to attract new investment. There have been a number of major recent discoveries, including two large, liquids-rich discoveries in Namibia and Côte d’Ivoire, although these will take time to generate new supply. 20 40 60 201520242035204020452050 Other Venezuela Nigeria Kuwait UAE Iraq Iran Russia Saudi Arabia OPEC + (mb/d) 201520242035204020452050 Other Middle East Africa Europe China Brazil, Guyana Canada United States Non-OPEC + (mb/d) and Argentina IEA.

OPEC+ production in 2050 is 15% higher (8 mb/d) than at any point in the history of oil markets. Annual real revenues for members of OPEC+ from oil production rise from USD 1.4 trillion in 2024 to 1.7 USD trillion in 2035 and USD 2.5 trillion in 2050, which is around 25% higher than the level in 2022 during the global energy crisis. Saudi Arabia leads production growth to 2035 as it develops new onshore and offshore fields, increases natural gas liquids (NGLs) production, and draws on its giant unconventional Jafurah field. Conventional crude oil production from Saudi Arabia, excluding NGLs and production from the neutral zone, rises beyond its current announced maximum sustainable capacity level of 12 mb/d from the mid-2040s and exceeds 13 mb/d by 2050 in the CPS. Supply in Iraq grows marginally from today’s level to 4.6 mb/d in 2035, which depends on progress in water injection capabilities to maintain production. The United Arab Emirates boost production by 0.6 mb/d to 4.8 mb/d in 2035, most of which comes from increased NGLs production. A gradual normalisation of the international situation in countries subject to sanctions – notably Russia, Iran and Venezuela – is assumed in the CPS. Supply from these three countries remains flat to 2035 and then increases over the longer term by 4 mb/d to 2050, reaching 20 mb/d in 2050. However, sanctions could remain in place on these countries for longer, in which case additional supply would need to come from elsewhere. Increases above the levels of the CPS may be possible from the United States, Canada, Brazil and other major resource-holders in the Middle East, but this would require additional investment and would very likely entail higher prices (Box 3.3). Russian oil supply fell by 0.3 mb/d in 2024 to 10.7 mb/d, largely due to sanctions, rising costs and infrastructural challenges. Supply remains around this level through to 2050 in the CPS, supported by progress in the Vostok Oil Project in the 2030s and increased output from currently hard-to-access resources which offset declines in its legacy supergiant fields. Box 3.3 ⊳ How high and for how long can US tight oil production rise? The growth of tight oil production in the United States in recent years has far surpassed anything seen previously in the history of oil supply. Production rose by 0.5 mb/d each year on average between 2015 and 2024 to 9 mb/d, which was roughly equivalent to adding current oil production in Guyana to the global balance every year. Tight oil wells are characterised by high initial production followed by steep decline, with continued drilling essential to maintain and extend production. US tight oil production is particularly sensitive to the oil price, and the dip in prices at the beginning of 2025 had an immediate impact on future production projections. In the CPS, the oil price rises to around USD 90 per barrel in 2035, unlocking around USD 60 billion average annual investment to 2035 as the price moves up (around 20% less than was invested in the sector in 2024). Tight crude oil and condensate production IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 157 3 rises by around 1.4 mb/d to 2035 in the CPS. This increase depends on increased investment and on the timely development of new infrastructure to avoid bottlenecks (Figure 3.32). Figure 3.32 ⊳ US tight crude oil and condensate production at various average annual levels of investment in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. US tight oil production rises by 1.4 mb/d to 2035; it could rise by an additional 2.5 mb/d if investment averages around the highest levels seen in recent years Higher investment levels than in the CPS would lead to larger production increases. Nonetheless, higher spending and drilling activity tend to be associated with rising input costs, production levels are limited by the overall level of oil that can be recovered,5 and recent evidence suggests that wells in a number of the key US tight oil plays are becoming more gas-rich. The industry is increasingly focused on maximising returns to shareholders and maintaining capital discipline. If annual investment averaged USD 90 billion to 2035 – similar to the highest ever levels seen in tight oil in 2018 and 2019 – then we estimate that tight oil production could rise to around 13 mb/d in 2035. Refining Oil use as petrochemical feedstock and jet fuel consumption increase by 2% each year on average to 2035 in the CPS. Aggregate gasoline and diesel demand stays broadly flat to 2035, with declines in advanced economies and China broadly offsetting increases in other emerging market and developing economies: the balance changes after 2040, leading to a 5% rise in road transport fuel demand to 2050 (Figure 3.33). 5 The US Energy Information Administration indicates 220 billion barrels of resources remaining (EIA, 2025). 5 10 15 2015 2024 2030 2035 mb/d USD 50 billion USD 60 billion (CPS) USD 80 billion USD 90 billion USD 70 billion IEA. CC BY 4.0. 158 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Around 9 mb/d of new refining capacity comes online in the CPS between 2024 and 2035. With around 5 mb/d in closures over this period, net refining throughput increases by 4 mb/d. Asia sees a net increase of around 3 mb/d in refining capacity between 2024 and 2035, led by increases in India. Since 2022, India has emerged as a global swing supplier, refining volumes of Russian crude oil exports that previously flowed to Europe. India’s refining capacity grows from 6 mb/d in 2024 by 1.5 mb/d to 2035 which solidifies its role as a key exporter of transport fuel. The refinery and petrochemical rationalisation programme in China shuts down some capacity, but additions and retrofits keep overall capacity levels broadly flat at just under 19 mb/d to 2035, and falling domestic demand drives a rise in oil product exports. Figure 3.33 ⊳ Demand for selected refined and fractionated products, 2015- 2050 and refinery runs by region in the CPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Demand for petrochemical feedstock rises much more strongly than demand for other refined products, while Asia increasingly cements itself as a refining hub Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; Petrochemical feedstock = naphtha, liquefied petroleum gases and ethane used as a feedstock; diesel, gasoline and kerosene includes transport use only. Refining capacity in the Middle East increased notably in recent years(to 11.5 mb/d in 2024), largely driven by Saudi Arabia, reflecting a strategic focus on increasing downstream integration. In the CPS, it rises by an additional 1.7 mb/d to 2035. In Africa, around 0.7 mb/d of new capacity comes online by 2035, including the Dangote refinery in Nigeria, (not yet at full capacity in early 2025). In North America, new refining capacity mostly comes online after 2035, increasing its total capacity to just over 22 mb/d in 2050, driven by rising domestic demand for petrochemical products, kerosene and diesel. Refining capacity in Europe falls from 16 mb/d in 2024 by 2.5 mb/d to 2035, reflecting both lower demand and a loss of competitiveness. 6 12 18 24 30 2015 2024 2035 2050 Gasoline Diesel Petrochemical feedstock Kerosene Product demand (mb/d) Change in refinery runs, 2024-2035 (mb/d) -4 -2 0 2 4 6 Asia Middle East Africa North America Europe IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 159 3 Box 3.4 ⊳ How could natural gas liquids momentum shift? Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are hydrocarbons separated and extracted from natural gas streams during processing. They include both condensates and natural gas plant liquids. NGLs production increased by one-third over the past decade, reaching 21 mb/d in 2024. As production rose, NGL-derived ethane and LPG increased in importance as low-cost competitors to crude oil-derived chemical inputs, sources of petrochemical feedstock and fuels for cooking. Figure 3.34 ⊳ NGLs production by region in the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. NGLs help meet growing demand for petrochemical feedstock, with Saudi Arabia and Qatar production set to accelerate over the next decade Note: mb/d = million barrels per day. Production of NGLs expands to 24 mb/d by 2035 in the CPS (Figure 3.34). Two-thirds of this is from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, where it is supported by the ramp-up of the Jafurah field and increases in output from the North Field. A further 20% of the increase is from North America, mainly from increased shale gas production: many US shale basins deliver high NGLs yields. NGLs production in the Middle East rises more rapidly to 2035 while North American output sustains the highest volumes even as the rate of growth stabilises. This means that the main supply centres for NGLs will be increasingly balanced between the Atlantic basin and east of Suez, which has important implications for the geography of oil product trade flows. Trade The Middle East exports 21 mb/d of oil today – around 50% of global net oil exports – and it remains by far the world’s largest oil exporter through to 2050 in the CPS (Figure 3.35). Net exports from North America increase by around 1.5 mb/d to more than 7 mb/d in 2035 and 2 4 6 8 10 12 2015 2020 2024 2035 North America Middle East Rest of world mb/d IEA. CC BY 4.0. 160 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 then fall in the 2040s as domestic supply declines slightly. Net exports from Russia in 2035 (7 mb/d) are about 0.2 mb/d lower than those of North America, but Russia becomes the world’s second-largest net oil exporter again by 2050 as North American exports decline in the 2040s. Exports from Central and South America more than double between 2024 and 2050, driven by surges in production from Guyana and Argentina, and later by Venezuela. Africa stops being a net oil exporter soon after 2035, following gradual declinesin production and a 2.8 mb/d increase in demand between 2035 and 2050. Figure 3.35 ⊳ Net oil trade for exporters and importers in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Middle East dominates global net exports today and it remains by far the largest exporter to 2050; India and Southeast Asia have rapidly rising import needs Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; C & S America = Central and South America. China overtook Europe as the world’s largest crude oil importer in 2020, and it keeps this position in the CPS through to 2050, even though its imports do not increase materially. Its import dependency increases from 73% in 2024 to nearly 80% in 2035, while import dependency in India rises from 87% in 2024 to 92% in 2035, despite government efforts to promote domestic production. Oil imports to Europe have remained around 10 mb/d over the last decade, but its demand for oil falls by more than 20% to 2035 and halves by 2050 in the CPS. As a result, oil imports to Europe drop to around 6 mb/d in 2050, even though domestic production drops by 2 mb/d to 2050. Global oil trade shifts eastward, boosting the strategic importance of the Strait of Malacca, where the volumes of oil handled in the CPS rise from 24 mb/d in 2024 (30% of global oil trade) to 28 mb/d by 2035. Volumes through the Strait of Hormuz also rise by just under 1.5 mb/d to 2035, reaching 21.5 m/d.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 161 3 3.5.2 Natural gas Demand Natural gas demand has increased on average by around 80 bcm per year over the last ten years. In the CPS, it increases by around 70 bcm every year to 2035, and by 2035 natural gas overtakes coal to become the second-largest fuel in terms of demand. Emerging market and developing economies are responsible for nearly all of this growth – their collective needs increase by 700 bcm to 2035 – with demand in advanced economies remaining broadly flat (Figure 3.36). By 2050, global natural gas demand in the CPS reaches 5 600 bcm, a 30% increase compared with 2024, and emerging market and developing economies account for two-thirds of global demand, up from 55% today. Figure 3.36 ⊳ Global natural gas demand by sector and region in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Natural gas demand increases by 20% to 2035 and by 30% to 2050, driven by expanding use in power generation and in industry, particularly in Asia Pacific and Middle East Note: bcm = billion cubic metres; Int. bunkers = international bunkers; Other = other energy sector and agriculture. Demand in emerging market and developing economies in Asia increases by 340 bcm between 2024 and 2035, in line with historical trends. Around 35% is more demand from the power sector and another 35% from industry. This is accompanied by investment in new infrastructure: the region adds 270 GW of new gas-fired power generation capacity to 2035, a 70% increase on current levels. Natural gas demand in China rises by 200 bcm to 630 bcm between 2024 and 2035, which is more than the growth in demand from all other emerging market and developing economies in Asia combined. Natural gas demand in India nearly doubles to 2035 to reach 140 bcm, led by growth in its city-gas distribution sector. The Middle East is a major source of natural gas demand growth. Its use of gas expands by 240 bcm between 2024 and 2035.

CC BY 4.0. 162 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 account for two-thirds of the increase, but more gas is also consumed in the oil and gas sector, for example in LNG liquefaction. Demand in advanced economies increases by 50 bcm between 2024 and 2035 in the CPS. In the United States, demand increases by around 10% to more than 1 000 bcm in 2035, led by a 50 bcm increase in the use of gas for electricity generation and an additional 15 bcm to run LNG liquefaction terminals. Natural gas demand in the European Union falls by just over 10% to less than 300 bcm in 2035 as current policy measures to reduce reliance on gas imports and increase the share of renewables take effect. In Japan, demand rises marginally from 90 bcm in 2024 to 95 bcm by 2035. In Korea, demand stays flat at 60 bcm. Supply Meeting the rise in natural gas demand in the CPS requires an acceleration in investment in a wide range of supply sources. The Middle East sees the largest expansion in supply of any region in the CPS, and its share of global production rises from 17% in 2024 to 22% in 2035 (Figure 3.37). Qatar leads the way within the region, increasing output from 170 bcm in 2024 to over 300 bcm in 2035, and most of this additional output is used to boost its LNG exports. Saudi Arabia ramps up production of non-associated gas, increasing output by more than 75 bcm between 2024 and 2035 to meet growing electricity demand and to substitute for oil in the power system. Its Jafurah field, the region’s largest unconventional, non-associated gas field, began production in 2024 and output is projected to exceed 20 bcm within five years. At peak production, it will provide nearly 15% of Saudi Arabia’s total gas output. Figure 3.37 ⊳ Average annual change in natural gas production in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 163 3 Today the United States is the world’s largest gas producer, accounting for over one-quarter of global supply, 1 070 bcm, and it increases production in the CPS by 210 bcm to 2035 (Figure 3.38). The shale revolution shows some signs of maturation, and the average annual increase in shale gas production in the CPS to 2035 is around one-half of the level seen over the previous decade. In 2024, the United States exported around 18% of its natural gas production; this rises to more than 25% in 2035. The benchmark Henry Hub price rises to around USD 4.5 per million British thermal units in 2035 to support the production of the new supplies needed to cover these larger volumes of export alongside rising domestic demand. Figure 3.38 ⊳ Natural gas by producing country in the CPS, 2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. All major producers invest in new supply to meet rising domestic demand or to boost exports, with nearly 80% of the global increase in supply from today’s top-ten producers Note: bcm = billion cubic metres. Natural gas production in Canada rises by 35 bcm to 250 bcm in 2035 in the CPS. Around two-thirds of this growth comes from its shale resource base, which, building on the commissioning of LNG Canada in 2025, is increasingly supporting the country’s entrance to the club of LNG exporters. Natural gas production in Russia stays flat around 680 bcm to 2035, as do its exports, at around 160 bcm, and it is assumed that domestic prices increase to compensate for falling export revenue. Gas fields in West Siberia get a second lease on life from the mid-2030s as the Power of Siberia II pipeline to China ramps up. This enables the legacy Yamburg and Urengoy fields to maintain output, with modest upside for the newer Bovanenkovo basin. The prospects for natural gas production in Australia differ by region and total production is broadly flat to 2035 (at around 165 bcm).

CC BY 4.0. 164 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 difficult to meet domestic demand while maintaining LNG exports from Queensland. In the west, supply growth from the offshore Carnarvon and Browse basins, among others, helps offset declines elsewhere, helping maintain Australia’s position as the dominant regional LNG supplier. Gas production in Africa rises in aggregate by 30 bcm to 2035, with increases in countries in sub-Saharan Africa more than offsetting declines in North Africa. In North Africa, Algeria and Libya have opened new exploration acreage in a bid to reinvigorate foreign inward investment, and in the CPS, this partially offsets declining production in existing fields. In Nigeria, efforts to boost the upstream sector lead to a near 15 bcm increase in natural gas production to 2035, and expansion of the LNG liquefaction plant on Bonny Island is set to further strengthen its position as an LNG exporter. Mozambique is also poised to increase production to support LNG exports, as the 18 bcm Mozambique LNG project is assumed to start around 2030. Other new gas producers also emerge in Africa, notably Senegal, where production increases to around 15 bcm by 2035. In Argentina, production is set to increase by 60% to 2035, bringing the total to around 75 bcm, led by increases in the Vaca Muerta formation, which has large volumes of associated gas. There is also a small increase in gas production in Brazil, but production falls in most other countries in Central and South America. Overall, the region sees a net increase of 25 bcm in natural gas production between 2024 and 2035. Trade Around 1 100 bcm of natural gas was traded over long distances in 2024, 45% by long\u0002distance pipeline and 55% as LNG. A large new wave of LNG capacity is set to come online over the period to 2030: this new capacity is fully utilised in the CPS, mainly through increased exports to emerging market and developing economies in Asia. Total LNG trade expands from 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035. Over this period, LNG imports by Europe grow by 80 bcm, while imports by countries in Asia rise by 240 bcm; more than 70% of all LNG exports are shipped to Asia in 2035 (Figure 3.39). China imported more than 100 bcm of LNG in 2024 – the largest amount of any country – and another 80 bcm of natural gas by pipeline. Its LNG imports have fallen to date in 2025 as a result of high LNG prices, robust domestic production and increased pipeline imports from Russia. In the CPS, its LNG imports rise by 75 bcm to 2035, while pipeline gas imports increase by 40 bcm, with roughly 65% of the increase from Russia and the rest from Central Asia. Southeast Asia imported around 35 bcm of LNG in 2024. Rapidly rising demand and declining domestic gas production increase this to 80 bcm by 2035 in the CPS, and an additional 50 bcm per year of regasification capacity is built to accommodate this growth. In 2035, India imports 50 bcm of LNG, up from 35 bcm today. Other emerging markets in Asia, particularly Pakistan and Bangladesh, import around 75 bcm of LNG in 2035, a 60% increase on 2024 levels. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 165 3 Japan and Korea – long-time leaders and first movers in the LNG industry – remain fully dependent on LNG to meet gas demand. Their combined imports rise by around 10 bcm to 2035 in the CPS. Figure 3.39 ⊳ Change in natural gas supply balance in selected regions in the CPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. LNG imports surge in Asia as domestic production fails to match growth in demand Note: LNG = liquefied natural gas. The United States is the world’s largest LNG exporter. It delivered 120 bcm in 2024 to more than 45 countries, with its flexible, destination-free contracts allowing cargoes to be redirected quickly in response to market shifts. Its export capacity doubles by 2030, and it maintains its current role as the largest LNG exporter through to 2050 in the CPS. It exports more than 250 bcm of LNG in 2035, half of which goes to Asia, up from 30% in 2024 (Figure 3.40). The Middle East, led by Qatar, doubles its LNG exports in the CPS to 260 bcm in 2035, with the Ruwais LNG complex in the United Arab Emirates adding more than 10 bcm of new capacity by 2028. Russia doubles gas exports to China from 40 bcm in 2024 to 80 bcm in 2035. The Power of Siberia I pipeline is currently operating at full capacity, and the Power of Siberia II pipeline, with nameplate capacity of 50 bcm, is assumed to ramp up from the mid-2030s. Russia also increases exports to the Caspian region. Russia’s annual LNG exports remain around the current level of 50 bcm in 2035. Despite finding some alternative export outlets for its gas since its invasion of Ukraine closed off many of its previous ones, Russia’s net income from natural gas exports remains below 2021 levels out to 2050 in the CPS. -150 -75 0 75 150 225 China India Southeast Asia Other Asia Japan and Korea European Union LNG Pipeline Domestic production bcm IEA.

Global coal demand has nearly doubled since then, and reached the record level of 6 090 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2024. Growth has been driven mainly by the use of coal to generate power in emerging market and developing economies, in particular China and India. However, in the CPS, global coal demand peaks before 2030 and then declines gradually: by 2035, demand is around 8% lower than 2024 levels, with a 315 Mtce reduction of coal use in power generation partially offset by a 30 Mtce increase in use in industry. By 2050, global coal use is around 20% lower than today (Figure 3.41). The power sector currently accounts for around two-thirds of global coal demand. In the CPS, the increase in renewables electricity generation to 2035 corresponds to more than 85% of the increase in global electricity demand. As a result, renewables start to edge coal out in most regions apart from Southeast Asia. Meanwhile coal use in industry rises in several emerging market and developing economies. For example, coal demand for the industry sector in India increases by 60% to 2035 and in Indonesia by more than 45%. China sees a 16% reduction in coal use in industry to 2035, a drop of 150 Mtce, mainly in its iron and steel sub-sector.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 167 3 Coal demand has fallen by around 40% since 2015 in advanced economies. It declines by a further 35% to 2035 as old coal-fired power plants are gradually retired: coal use in power falls by around 45% to 2035, and in industry it falls by around 5% from a low base. Figure 3.41 ⊳ Coal demand by sector and region/country in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Coal use peaks before 2030, mainly as demand declines in China and in advanced economies; only coal use in industry remains resilient to 2050 Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Box 3.5 ⊳ Could coal demand continue to increase? A growth story for coal over the coming decades cannot entirely be ruled out but it would fly in the face of two crucial structural trends witnessed in recent years: the rise of renewable sources of power generation, and the shift in China away from an especially coal-intensive model of growth and infrastructure development. As such, sustained growth for coal demand appears highly unlikely. Nonetheless it is useful to explore the circumstances under which it could take place (Figure 3.42). More than any other fuel, the dynamics in coal markets are determined by a handful of countries, mostly in Asia. By far, China is the most notable, followed by India, Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia. The average age of the coal-fired power plants in emerging market and developing economies in Asia is around 15 years, so many of them could in theory have a long operational future; however, continued growth in coal use would also imply the construction of substantial additional plants. Continued growth in coal demand could take place if the expansion of wind and solar PV electricity generation ended. Electricity generation from wind and solar PV increases by around 1 000 TWh on average every year in the CPS between 2024 and 2035.

CC BY 4.0. 168 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 challenges as well as tariffs or other trade measures could hinder the level of expansion in some markets projected in the CPS. If the annual increase in global wind and solar PV generation was more in line with the 2024 level, 650 TWh, it would imply an additional 450 Mtce of coal demand in 2035 based on the current global power mix. Yet multiple factors push in the opposite direction, including the underlying economics and strong industrial interest in the manufacture and deployment of wind and solar PV, notably in China. Figure 3.42 ⊳ Factors that could lead to continued coal growth above the levels of the CPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Further increases in demand for coal could reflect a huge slowdown in clean technology deployment and a major reduction in efficiency gains Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Electricity demand is another important variable: it increases by around 3% each year to 2035 in the CPS, which is similar to the average rate of growth in the last decade. But electricity demand increased by 4.2% in 2024. If the rate of demand growth were to be maintained through to 2035, it would imply an additional 380 Mtce of coal, assuming no changes in the power generation mix. Coal demand could also be affected at the margin by slower increases in power sector efficiency. The CPS includes a slight increase in efficiency as older, less efficient plants are retired, or by reducing coal-to-gas switching in some markets, but neither of these factors are game-changers on their own. In practice, the considerations that seem most likely to affect the pace at which the world moves away from coal concern the social consequences of change. As countries that have been down this route will attest, coal transitions are challenging (IEA, 2022). The implications of declining production on coal-dependent communities and regions can be 5 000 5 500 6 000 6 500 7 000 2015 2025 2035 Less coal-to-gas No efficiency gains in power Higher electricity demand Less wind and solar Mtce CPS Higher growth rate IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 3 | Current Policies Scenario 169 3 substantial, and could prove to be more important than the economics of power generation in determining the rate of change. In the CPS, the decline of coal demand is relatively gradual, and would only continue an existing trend. China, for example, has already seen a huge reduction in its coal workforce as the sector modernised over the last ten years. In some circumstances, however, a prolonged role for coal could be driven by social or other political considerations. Supply Coal production in China expanded by around 2 300 Mtce between 2000 and 2024, which represents nearly three-quarters of the growth in global coal production over the period. In the CPS, production in China declines by 10% from close to 3 350 Mtce in 2024 to just over 2 900 Mtce in 2035 (Figure 3.43). Figure 3.43 ⊳ Coal production by region/country and type in the CPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Coal production falls gradually in most major producers; declines are steeper for steam coal, lignite and peat than for coking coal Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. In India, reflecting strong domestic demand and supportive policies, coal production reached almost 600 Mtce in 2024, an increase of nearly 100 Mtce since 2022. In the CPS, India sees the largest increase in coal production, adding 100 Mtce to its annual output by 2035. Most other emerging market and developing economies reduce coal output, though a few countries in Africa and Asia that currently produce small amounts of coal see modest increases in production to 2035 in the CPS.

Coal production in advanced economies, totalling 1 000 Mtce in 2024, has fallen by roughly 400 Mtce since 2015. This downward trajectory continues in the CPS, albeit at a slower pace, with production falling by around 250 Mtce to 2035. The production outlook varies by coal type (Figure 3.44). Steam coal is mostly used for power generation and accounts for around 80% of world production today, and its production falls by just over 10% to 2035. Coking coal is mostly used in iron and steel production, and its production expandsin several countries. A key exception is China, where it falls by more than 20% to 2035 in the CPS. Lignite and peat production have the steepest falls, a drop of around 45% to 2035, mostly due to mine closures in Europe.

Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 171 Chapter 4 Stated Policies Scenario Stepping up the pace of change? • The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) is an exploratory scenario, designed to reflect the prevailing direction of travel for the energy system based on a detailed reading of country-specific energy, climate and related industrial policies that have been adopted or put forward, even if not yet codified in law. It reflects the state of technology and market conditions but does not include aspirational goals. • Total final consumption grows 1% annually to 2035 in the STEPS, with India and other emerging market and developing economies leading demand growth. It increases more slowly than in the past decade as efficiency gains accelerate to 2.2% per year, driven by the increasing electrification of end-uses. • Oil demand peaks at 102 million barrels per day (mb/d) around 2030 before gradually declining. Global electric car sales share rises from over 20% today to over 50% by 2035, despite lower electric vehicle (EV) sales in the United States in this Outlook. In 2035, over 840 million EVs displace 10 mb/d of oil, mainly in Asia and Europe. Oil use for petrochemicals and aviation continues to increase to 2035 and 2050. Natural gas demand increases nearly 1% annually to 2035, supported by abundant supply and major liquefied natural gas (LNG) expansions in the United States and Qatar, then levels off. Coal demand peaks before 2030 as declines in China outweigh increases in India and Southeast Asia. • From the 2030s, renewables in aggregate meet all additional global energy demand as they provide increasing amounts of generation in a rapidly expanding power sector. The renewables share in electricity generation rises from one-third today to over half by 2035 and two-thirds by 2050, led by solar and wind power with support from batteries. Grid upgrades and dispatchable sources are critical to maintain security. Nuclear output grows 40% to 2035, maintaining a 9% share of electricity generation. • The world moves firmly into the Age of Electricity in the STEPS, with electricity use rising four-times faster than overall energy demand to 2035. In advanced economies, EVs and data centres push up electricity demand. In emerging market and developing economies, rising incomes boost demand for appliances and air conditioners. • Dynamism in the electricity sector is not matched by the rise of low-emissions fuels: liquid biofuels and biogases do well in some markets, but new fuels generally struggle to gain market share and remain heavily dependent on policy support to compete. • Energy-sector CO₂ emissions peak near term at just over 38 gigatonne (Gt), falling to 35 Gt by the mid-2030s and below 30 Gt by 2050 – a level last seen in 2005 – driven mainly by reduced coal use in China’s power sector. Emissions from end-use sectors flatten but do not decline significantly. Europe sees one of the largest percentage drops. By 2100, the global temperature is projected to rise by 2.5 °C. SUMMARY IEA.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 173 4 4.1 Introduction The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) has a long pedigree in the International Energy Agency (IEA) family of scenarios. It was introduced in 2019 with this name, but it has much in common with the previous New Policies Scenario that dates back to the 2010 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO). The intention of this scenario is to reflect the prevailing direction of travel for the energy system based on a detailed reading of the latest policy settings in countries around the world. It takes into account specific energy, climate and related industrial policies that have been adopted or put forward, as well as policy intentions not yet codified into law but supported by markets, infrastructure and financial conditions. (See Chapter 2 for full scenario descriptions and Annex B for underlying assumptions). Like the Current Policies Scenario detailed in Chapter 3, the STEPS is an exploratory scenario in that it does not target a predetermined outcome. Instead, it sets the starting conditions and sees where they lead. As such, it does not assume that aspirational goals, such as those included in some Nationally Determined Contributions, are achieved. It is grounded in what policies are actually in place or planned across different sectors of the energy economy. This does not make the STEPS a forecast – as we have said on many occasions, the IEA does not have a long-term forecast. Policies and circumstances will undoubtedly change, and we do not seek to anticipate or predict those changes. The aim of this scenario, and of the Outlook as a whole, is simply to provide a coherent, rigorous, data-driven framework for assessing how the energy sector might evolve, to better inform the important decisions that are being taken today. The methodology for the STEPS has been consistent over time, but the modelling approaches have evolved across successive iterations of the scenario. Among other things, there has been a concerted effort to develop insights into energy supply chains, including those for critical minerals. Work on electricity has been underpinned by granular hourly modelling of the operation of power systems, and by detailed consideration of new sources of demand such as data centres and artificial intelligence (AI). New geospatial analysis is now a regular feature of this IEA modelling and analysis. This chapter presents the new projections for the STEPS to 2050, starting with an overview of the broad energy demand outlook and the implications for emissions. It then goes into more detail on end-use sectors, examining among other things the future of the global vehicle fleet, the rapid growth in demand for cooling, and the ways in which some important trends are affecting the outlook for industry. The power sector section looks in detail at the onset of the Age of Electricity, which is characterised by strong demand growth across multiple sectors and continued structural changes in generation, and includes an exploration of its implications for grid infrastructure. The outlook for fuels is covered in the concluding sections, including oil, natural gas and coal as well as low-emissions fuels. Among other elements, it examines the drivers of demand and supply, and the prospective major expansion of trade in liquefied natural gas (LNG). IEA. CC BY 4.0. 174 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 4.2 Overview 4.2.1 Total energy demand Total energy demand increases from 654 exajoules (EJ) today to over 705 EJ in 2035, an increase that is roughly equivalent to the current energy demand in the European Union. Global gross domestic product (GDP) is assumed to rise at around 3% a year to 2035, in line with its rate of growth over the past decade, while total energy demand growth halves from an annual average of 1.6% over the past decade to 0.7% over the period to 2035. This continued decoupling of GDP and energy use reflects a rise in energy intensity improvements from an average of 1.4% per year over the past decade to 2.2% per year through to 2035. These improvements, which are chiefly driven by end-use electrification and efficiency gains from the uptake of renewables, mean that the energy ultimately available to end-users, i.e. useful energy, net of all conversion losses across the system, rises at virtually the same rate over the next decade as the last one (Figure 4.1). Growth in both total energy demand and in useful energy is fastest in emerging market and developing economies other than China, which enables economic development and welfare gains. Figure 4.1 ⊳ Total energy demand by fuel, 2015-2050, and growth of selected indicators, 2015-2024, and in the STEPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Fossil fuels reach high points in the next decade before being overtaken by renewables as total demand growth slows, but the energy available to end-users does not Note: EJ = exajoule. The fossil fuel shares in total energy demand decline from 79% today to 71% in 2035. Coal demand initially remains broadly stable at its current level of 6 090 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce), but it peaks before 2030 and then declines to under 4 900 Mtce in 2035 as it is edged out of the power sector. Oil demand rises slowly to around 102 million barrels 60 120 180 240 2015 2024 2035 2050 Total energy demand EJ Oil Coal Natural gas Nuclear Renewables 0.6% 1.2% 1.8% 2.4% Total energy demand Useful energy GDP per capita 2015-2024 2024-2035 Average annual growth IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 175 4 per day (mb/d) by 2030 before beginning a slow decline in subsequent years, with reductions in oil demand for road transport broadly offset by increased oil use for petrochemicals. Natural gas demand rises by 1% per year to 2035, driven mainly by growth in industry and power, and then remains stable. Demand for renewables increases by an average of 5.5% per year to 2035: most of the additional demand comes from the power sector, but the direct use of renewables also increases, particularly in industry and biofuels in transport. Renewable power capacity expands 2.6-times from 2022 to 2030, and 3.7-times by 2035. Nuclear capacity increases by 3% on average to 2035. Today, around one-third of global energy demand is in advanced economies and two-thirds is in emerging market and developing economies. Between now and 2035, energy demand growth comes primarily from emerging market and developing economies, led by India, Southeast Asia, Middle East, China and Africa. While most of the growth in demand for oil and natural gas comes from emerging market and developing economies, demand for low\u0002emissions sources increase in all regions (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2 ⊳ Total energy demand by region, 2015-2050, and change by type and region in the STEPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Emerging market and developing economies drive growth in total energy demand; advanced economies and China see stronger shifts towards low-emissions sources Note: EJ = exajoule; C & S = Central and South America. Total energy demand is 4% higher by 2035 in the STEPS in this Outlook than in the version in the World Energy Outlook-2024 (WEO-2024). The differences are largely due to upward revisions in coal demand (10% or 440 Mtce higher in 2035 in this Outlook, mainly for use in power generation in China and United States), and in natural gas demand (8% or 350 billion cubic metres [bcm]) higher in 2035 in this Outlook mainly for use in power generation in the United States. The changes in China are driven by major regulatory changes for renewables 200 400 600 800 2015 2024 2035 2050 Rest of world Africa Middle East C & S America Southeast Asia India China Japan and Korea European Union North America Total energy demand (EJ) -40 -20 0 20 40 Low-emissions Unabated fossil fuels Net change, 2024-2035 (EJ) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 176 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 that moderate their near-term growth, together with an expectation of more rapid growth in electricity output. In the United States, both regulatory shifts and higher expectations for data centre demand drive the changes to the outlook. Demand for nuclear power has also been revised upward (4% higher in 2035 in this Outlook), which reflects an expanded pipeline of projects and increased policy momentum, particularly in some European countries. Demand for renewables has been revised downward in this STEPS (3% lower in 2035) primarily due to policy and regulatory changes in the United States. 4.2.2 CO2 emissions Global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions totalled 38 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2024. In the STEPS, they peak in the next few years and fall to around 35 Gt by 2035, a level last seen in 2015. By 2050, global CO2 emissions are below 30 Gt, a level last seen in 2005. The reduction in emissions is primarily driven by changes in power generation (Figure 4.3), where the share of fossil fuels dropsfrom around 60% today to less than 40% in 2035 and about 20% in 2050. Increased demand for renewables and further electrification of end-uses are the leading sources of emissions reductions through to 2035 and then to 2050. Although global energy-related emissions have yet to peak, CO2 emissions per capita did so in 2013, and they continue to decline through to 2035 and beyond. Figure 4.3 ⊳ CO2 emissions by sector and region in the STEPS, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Changes in the power generation mix drive an overall reduction in energy-related CO2 emissions, with reduced coal use as the main driver, especially in China Note: Gt CO2 = gigatonnes of carbon dioxide; C & S America = Central and South America. Coal is the largest source of CO2 emissions today, making up over 40% of the global total. Reductions in coal use bring about a 3.1 Gt decrease in CO2 emissions to 2035, more than the overall net reduction by 2035. In parallel, emissions from oil use decline by 660 million 10 20 30 40 2015 2024 2035 2050 North America European Union Japan and Korea China Southeast Asia C & S America Middle East Africa By region India Rest of world 4 8 12 16 2015 2024 2035 2050 By sector Gt CO2 Power Industry Transport Buildings Other IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 177 4 tonnes (Mt), while natural gas emissions rise by 860 Mt. Natural gas accounted for almost half of the growth in CO2 emissions over the last decade; it is also responsible for an increasing share of CO2 emissions in the coming years as coal-to-gas switching continues in the power sector and as demand for gas rises in industry. Underlying the global trend, regions see various trajectories. The European Union sees one of the largest percentage reductions: its CO2 emissions in 2035 fall to 40% below today’s levels (60% below 1990 levels). Emissions in China peak before 2030 and undergo the largest absolute reduction, falling 2.1 Gt to 2035. By contrast, emissions in India and Southeast Asia increase by around 20% (530 Mt and 440 Mt respectively). On average, per capita emissions in advanced economies are currently double those in emerging market and developing economies: the differential narrows in the STEPS, but they remain 75% higher in 2035. Energy-related methane emissions fall from around 145 Mt today to 115 Mt in 2035, reflecting concerted efforts in some countries to reduce the emissions intensity of supply and to provide access to clean cooking, together with a 4% reduction in global fossil fuel use. Accounting for all greenhouse gases, the long-term global mean temperature rise increases from today’s level of around 1.4 degree Celsius (°C) to 1.5 °C by 2030 and reach 2 °C before 2060. By 2100, the temperature rise is 2.5 °C. (See Chapter 5 for more detail). 4.3 Total final consumption Global total final consumption – all energy consumed by end-users – was around 450 EJ in 2024, of which the industry sector accounted for 38%, and the transport and buildings sectors for 28% each. The balance between end-use sectors varies by region, in part due to differing levels of access to energy services (Figure 4.4). In the STEPS, total final consumption rises to over 500 EJ through to 2035, and the balance by sector in each region is broadly stable. In advanced economies, each main sector represents close to one-third of the total, with the share of industry being the smallest. In emerging market and developing economies, by contrast, industry continues to account for the largest portion of total final consumption up to 2035, with its share of the total being as much as 60% in China and nearly half in India today. In Africa, the buildings sector is responsible today for over half of total final consumption, reflecting the lack of access to efficient energy sources faced by many households (see Chapter 6). Total final consumption per capita is quite stable until 2035 at a global level of around 56 gigajoules (GJ) per capita, though there are regional differences. While new energy uses including AI grow steadily, advanced economies see consumption per capita decline from 110 GJ per capita to around 105 GJ per capita in 2035, thanks to efficiency improvements, notably those that flow from increasing electrification of heating and mobility. Meanwhile, emerging market and developing economies see consumption per capita increase from 42 GJ per capita today to 45 GJ per capita by 2035, with increasing demand for energy services from households acquiring vehicles, air conditioners and other appliances tempered by the switch to more efficient energy sources.

Total final consumption remains relatively evenly split across the main end-use sectors in advanced economies, while it is dominated by industry in Asia and by buildings in Africa Notes: EJ = exajoule; C & S = Central and South America. Other includes agriculture and non-energy use. 4.3.1 Transport Oil continues to dominate energy use in the transport sector, but this is slowly changing. Its share of consumption in the transport sector was over 92% in 2015, but fell to 90% in 2024, reflecting the expanding use of electricity, bioenergy and natural gas. Electrification plays an important part in reducing the dominance of oil in the STEPS (Figure 4.5). By 2035, electricity accounts for 6% of global transport energy demand, and some parts of world, e.g. Japan, United States, Canada, China and Europe as a whole, have already passed peak oil consumption in their transport sectors. Natural gas also gains in importance in transport, particularly in shipping and long-haul trucking. In China, policy support and a favourable natural gas price environment encourage the adoption of LNG heavy-freight trucks. In India, natural gas car sales expand under similar conditions. Bioenergy remains a key alternative to oil in transport. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) limits the role it is likely to play in global road transport, but does not end it. Blending mandates continue to support bioenergy use in many regions, including Brazil, European Union, India, 25 50 75 100 125 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 Buildings Industry Transport Other EJ North America European Union Japan and Korea China India Southeast Asia C & S America Middle East Africa IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 179 4 Indonesia and the United States. By 2035, bioenergy accounts for around 20-30% of transport energy use in Brazil and Indonesia, and close to 10% in the United States and the European Union. Figure 4.5 ⊳ Energy demand in transport by fuel and region in the STEPS, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Fossil fuel demand declines in advanced economies, while its rate of growth slows in emerging market and developing economies, levelling off relative to historical trends Notes: EJ = exajoule. Hydrogen fuels include hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. Trends in energy carriers vary across transport modes, with electrification leading in rail and road, while alternative fuels gain ground in shipping and aviation.  Road transportstill relies on oil, though electricity meets close to 7% of demand by 2035 in the STEPS, up from less than 1% today. Increasing electrification means that oil demand for road transport peaks in the coming years, even though passenger car activity rises by over 30% by 2035 as car ownership expands in emerging market and developing economies, and global freight activity increases by a third over the same period.  Rail is currently the most electrified transport mode. It is also the most energy efficient mode for passenger transportation and the second most efficient mode for freight transportation (Box 4.1). Electricity and biofuels currently meet more than 50% of energy demand in rail transport, and this rises to 57% by 2035. As a result, oil demand falls slightly despite passenger and freight rail activity increasing by over 30% and 15% respectively. By 2050, the share of oil in rail transport declines from nearly 50% to 40%, while electricity and bioenergy together account for the remaining 60% of rail energy demand. 20 40 60 80 100 2015 2024 2035 2050 2015 2024 2035 2050 Hydrogen fuels Electricity Bioenergy Natural gas Oil EJ Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies IEA. CC BY 4.0. 180 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025  Shipping remains heavily dependent on oil, which meets over 90% of its energy demand today. This share declines in the coming years, but remains over 80% in 2035. The fuel mix continues to diversify through to 2050, even as shipping activity rises around 45%. The share of oil in shipping falls to 70% by 2050, while the combined share of natural gas and bioenergy rises to over 25%, with methanol, hydrogen and ammonia together accounting for a further 3%. Today’s policies support low-emissions fuels covering nearly 15% of shipping energy demand by 2050.  Aviation remains the most oil-dependent mode over the outlook period, with oil accounting for over 95% of energy use in 2035 and 90% in 2050. The share of low\u0002emissions fuels rises to nearly 5% in 2035 and 10% in 2050, the lowest across all transport modes, despite sustainable aviation fuel mandates in the European Union and United Kingdom. By 2050, oil use in aviation exceeds 10 mb/d, more than double the combined oil use of shipping and rail. Box 4.1 ⊳ How rail development is reducing oil demand in China The rail network in China is highly electrified, with over 70% of non-urban rail activity powered by electricity. Therefore, shifting activity to rail from road and aviation transport helps reduce oil demand. In China, on average, non-urban passenger rail is around 80-times less oil intensive per passenger-kilometre than aviation. The equivalent figures for passenger cars are nearly 100-times less oil intensive and 10-times for buses. Freight rail is around 30-times less oil intensive than road freight. Figure 4.6 ⊳ Oil demand for transport in China with and without non-urban rail expansion, and non-urban rail activity in the STEPS, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Expansion of non-urban rail transport in China has reduced oil demand, avoiding nearly 1.5 mb/d in 2024 – more than the oil saved by EVs worldwide Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. 3 6 9 2015 2024 2030 2035 Case without non-urban rail STEPS Oil demand (mb/d) 0.6 1.2 1.8 2015202420302035 Passenger-kilometres Non-urban rail activity (trillion) 1.5 3.0 4.5 2015202420302035 Tonne-kilometres IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 181 4 China leads the world in non-urban passenger rail and freight rail activity, accounting for nearly 40% and 30% of global demand respectively. Its high-speed rail (HSR)1 lines have doubled since 2015 to over 40 000 kilometres(km) today – almost three-times more than the length of HSR lines in the rest of the world combined. Europe has the second-largest HSR network, which is one-quarter the size of China’s; Japan and Korea have the next largest (UIC, 2025). By 2035, China’s HSR network stretches to around 45 000 km in the STEPS. In a counterfactual case where non-urban rail activity in China remains at its 2000 level, oil demand would be nearly 1.5 mb/d higher in 2024 than it is – a level of avoided demand larger than the global oil savings from EVs today (Figure 4.6). Between 2015 and 2024, non-urban rail in China has cumulatively avoided almost 12 mb/d of oil demand and over 1.6 Gt CO2 – equivalent to its annual emissions from transport, buildings and light industry combined in 2024. How does the future vehicle fleet evolve? In 2024, global electric car 2 sales rose by around 25% year-on-year to over 17 million, accounting for one-in-five cars sold worldwide. Sales are expected to reach over 20 million in 2025, and to account for over one-in-four cars sold worldwide. China alone is on track to see the sale of over 14 million electric cars in 2025 – more than the entire world total of electric car sales two years ago. Electric car sales in the European Union fell in 2024 following subsidy withdrawals in Germany, but the first-half of 2025 shows a nearly 22% year-on-year increase, driven by the introduction of around ten new battery electric models priced below EUR 25 000 and stricter CO2 emissions standards. In the United States, electric car sales rose 10% in 2024, though growth slowed to 4% in the first-half of 2025. EV adoption continues to rise in emerging market and developing economies, particularly in Viet Nam, Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil. For instance, the EV market share in Viet Nam exceeds 40%. In the STEPS, EVs account for around 50% of sales of all vehicle types by 2035, resulting in over 10 mb/d of oil savings. Efficiency improvements in conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles reduce oil demand further by around 3.5 mb/d. Additional savings are from the use of bioenergy and natural gas as vehicle fuel, which avoid around 0.6 mb/d and 0.8 mb/d respectively by 2035. Battery prices fell by around 75% between 2015 and 2024, making EVs more cost competitive with conventional cars in several key markets (IEA, 2025a). In addition, more affordable electric car models are entering the market, particularly in the European Union. Public charging infrastructure has expanded too, with more than 1.3 million new charging points added in 2024, bringing the global total to more than 5 million. 1 Electricity-powered high-speed rail with maximum speed of at least 250 kilometres per hour. 2 Electric cars include both battery electric and plug-in hybrid powertrains.

The global EV fleet expands more than sixfold by 2035, which avoids oil demand of over 10 mb/d that year Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; ICE = internal combustion engine. Light-duty vehicles include passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Heavy trucks include both medium- and heavy-freight trucks. Other vehicles include buses and two/three-wheelers. Gasoline and diesel ICE vehicles are fuelled by gasoline, diesel, biofuels or synthetic fuels, and include hybrid internal combustion vehicles. Zero-emissions vehicles include both electric and fuel cell vehicles. These technology trends, supported by fuel economy standards and zero emissions vehicle mandates, are increasing the uptake of EVs (Figure 4.7). In the STEPS, the peak year for internal combustion engine (ICE) car sales was in 2017, even though the global car fleet goes from 1.4 billion today to over 1.6 billion by 2035. By 2050, half of the global light-duty vehicle fleet is electric. Sales of electric two/three-wheelers and buses rise to 80% and 45% respectively of total sales by 2050. Electric two/three-wheelers are the most affordable entry point to electric mobility and require less power to operate: they are especially popular in China, India and Southeast Asia (Figure 4.8). Electric urban buses help to improve air quality and are being widely adopted: in 2024, nearly all new city buses in China and almost half in the European Union were electric. Electrification is also reaching vehicle types that traditionally have been challenging to progress beyond oil use. In the STEPS by 2050, nearly 25% of the global heavy truck3 fleet is electrified, a total of around 25 million vehicles. This growth is led by China, European Union, Japan, Korea and United Kingdom. In China, electric heavy trucks are already becoming cost competitive thanks to low electricity prices and policy support. 3 Heavy trucks include both medium freight trucks (gross weight 3.5 to 15 tonnes) and heavy-freight trucks (gross weight >15 tonnes). 6 12 18 24 30 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 2024 2035 2050 2024 2035 2050 2024 2035 2050 mb/d Zero-emissions vehicles Natural gas ICE Gasoline and diesel ICE Oil demand (right axis) Billion units Light-duty vehicles Heavy trucks Other vehicles IEA.

China and European Union lead in the tripling of global electric car sales by 2035, while electric two/three-wheelers see a sixfold sales increase in developing economies Sources: Historical numbers for electric car sales are based on ACEA (2025); European Commission (2025); EV Volumes (2025); Marklines (2025). EV sales expansion has major implications for battery demand. By 2035, global EV sales battery demand rises to over 5 terawatt-hours (TWh), five-times the level of demand in 2024. Announced battery production capacity appears sufficient to meet this rapidly growing demand. China dominates both battery demand and manufacturing capacity. Battery demand for electric cars alone in China is already larger than the total battery demand of advanced economies, including battery storage, yet the share of advanced economiesin total EV battery demand increases slightly in the long run in the STEPS. 4.3.2 Buildings Global energy demand in the buildings sector rises in the STEPS at an average of 0.9% per year to 2035, a slower rate than the past decade annual average of about 1.0%. Annual coal and oil demand in buildings declined in the last decade, and it falls by a further 9% per year for coal and 2% per year for oil through to 2035 (Figure 4.9). Natural gas use increased at about the same rate as total energy demand in buildings over the last decade: in the STEPS, it increases at a slower rate in the short term, flattens out at around 870 bcm at the end of the decade, then shifts to a structural decline to 2050. This decline in natural gas demand is primarily in advanced economies, where heating demand is curbed by the electrification of space heating and efficiency improvements. In emerging market and developing economies, natural gas use continues to grow, particularly for cooking and water heating in countries such as Brazil, India and Indonesia, where economic growth boosts incomes and policies aim 10 20 30 40 50 60 2024 2035 2024 2035 Million units China European Union United States India Southeast Asia Other Electric car sales Electric two/three-wheelers sales IEA.

By 2035, more than 700 million people gain access to clean cooking technologies, increasing the global access rate to over 80%. As a result, the traditional use of biomass declines by over a quarter by 2035. Figure 4.9 ⊳ Energy demand in buildings by region and fuel in the STEPS, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity use in buildings increases significantly in all economies; fossil fuel use declines in advanced economies Notes: EJ = exajoule; Other = non-renewable waste and hydrogen; Other renewables = solar thermal and geothermal. Buildings sector includes energy consumption for data centres and desalination. Electricity use expands more than three-times faster than total building sector energy consumption. Electricity demand growth in buildings increases from an annual average of 2.6% over the past decade to 2.8% per year to 2035. Demand growth is particularly strong in emerging market and developing economies, where it rises by over 4% each year, reflecting inter alia a 25% increase in residential floorspace and a 70% increase in air conditioner ownership. Emerging market and developing economies account for 90% of the global ownership expansion of air conditioners, and their space cooling demand increases by more than 1 100 TWh in the period to 2035 in the STEPS, which is equivalent to current electricity use in the Middle East (Figure 4.10). In advanced economies, electricity demand grows on average by 1.3% per year to 2035, driven by the electrification of space heating, growth in appliance ownership, demand for information technology services, and the development of AI. Data centres account for half of buildings sector electricity demand growth to 2035 in advanced economies: in the United States, where data centre expansion is primarily concentrated, that share rises to 70%. Global heat pump sales rose by 27% from 2020 to 2024. After a sharp increase in 2022, global sales declined in 2023 before stabilising in 2024. This was despite a drop in European sales in 2024, where the market contracted for two consecutive years following an unprecedented 30 60 90 120 2015 2024 2035 2050 2015 2024 2035 2050 Other Other renewables Modern bioenergy Traditional use of District heat Electricity Natural gas Oil Coal EJ biomass Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies IEA.

There are now signs of renewed growth: we estimate that global sales increased by about 5% in the first-half of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. Figure 4.10 ⊳ Key residential energy demand drivers by economic grouping in the STEPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Over the next ten years, residential floorspace expands by 20% and the number of air conditioners units by 50%, mostly in emerging market and developing economies Notes: m2 = square metre. Air conditioners of varied sizes are converted to an equivalent number of room air conditioning units. Appliances include among others washing machines, dishwashers, dryers, refrigerators, televisions and computers. In the STEPS, heat pump sales are supported both by their economic competitiveness and by continued regulatory support and financial incentives. In the United States and China, air-to\u0002air units account for most heat pump sales and represent a cost competitive option for both space cooling and heating. In the Nordic countries, heat pumps are the most common choice for households, often thanks to low electricity prices. Elsewhere, continued regulatory support and financial incentives will be important, notably in the parts of the European Union with low cooling needs for air-to-water heat pumps. Although Japan is already a mature market for heat pumps, their use expands as more building owners opt to use a reverse cycle heat pump as their primary heating/cooling equipment. Subsidies for domestic heat pump water heaters further support growth in the outlook. By 2035 in the STEPS, heat pumps meet almost 40% of space heating demand in Japan and the United States, while the share of space heating provided by heat pumps doubles in the European Union and China (Figure 4.11). Globally, heat pumps displace around 40 bcm of gas in 2035 relative to today, and reduce the energy intensity of heating by up to 8% in major heating markets. Despite the positive outlook in the STEPS, heat pump sales remain sensitive to consumer confidence and policy stability, as well as economic factors such as the 100 200 300 400 2024 2035 2050 Floorspace Billion m² Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies 1 2 3 4 2024 2035 2050 Air conditioner stock Billion units 5 10 15 20 2024 2035 2050 Appliance stock Billion units IEA.

Failure to provide stable supportive frameworks would hinder the uptake of heat pump technologies. Figure 4.11 ⊳ Global heat pump sales and contribution to space heating demand in selected regions in the STEPS, 2020-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Heat pump sales double by 2030 with strong growth in four major markets, and meet an increasing share of space heating demand Note: GW = gigawatt. Meeting mounting cooling needs with more efficient air conditioners Space cooling has been one of the fastest growing energy end-uses in the buildings sector over the past decade, increasing by around 4% per year, second only to data centres. With rising incomes, population growth and a warming climate, this trend continues in the STEPS, resulting in an increase of 740 TWh in residential cooling demand by 2035 (Figure 4.12). The global distribution of cooling demand shifts significantly towards emerging market and developing economies, which account for 80% of residential cooling demand in 2035. Demand per capita increases by just over 10% in advanced economies, compared to almost 60% in emerging market and developing economies. This is primarily due to climatic differences, higher current levels of air conditioner ownership in advanced economies, and the higher efficiency of cooling systems sold in advanced economies reflective of stronger minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for air conditioners. Over the past two decades, MEPS for air conditioners have been instituted in nearly all major cooling markets. However, the stringency of the standards varies significantly across markets. In general, the countries with the highest projected growth in cooling demand are also the ones where the least-efficient air conditioners are being sold today. If all countries with established MEPS for air conditioners were to raise their standards to match those in Japan, global cooling demand would be 25% lower in 2035 than the 2 100 TWh projected in the STEPS. 50 100 150 200 250 2020 2022 2024 2030 2035 China United States European Union Japan Other Heat pump sales GW 8% 16% 24% 32% 40% 2020 2025 2030 2035 Space heating demand met by heat pumps IEA.

Box 4.2 ⊳ Floorspace doubles but building codes restrain demand growth Floorspace in buildings worldwide has increased from 150 billion square metres (m2) in 2000 to 270 billion m2 in 2024. Continuing urbanisation and economic development mean that it is set to reach 300 billion m2 by 2030. The number of countries with mandatory energy-related building energy codes was 25 in 2000 and extended to 85 in 2025. Current energy-related building codes save around 10 EJ annually compared to a baseline without codes, primarily by reducing heating demand in advanced economies and China (Figure 4.13). In some emerging market and developing economies where cooling needs are significant, the estimated energy savings linked to building codes are limited by enforcement and compliance challenges. In Central and South American countries with mandatory building codes, for example, less than half of all new construction meets energy performance standards. An assessment of compliance and enforcement policies in 29 emerging market and developing economies shows that only 11 countries have implemented the steps necessary to enforce building codes (World Bank, 2025). Reflecting these shortcomings, the stock of non-compliant floorspace stays steady between 2024 and 2050 in the STEPS, even though building codes having been established in all of the largest construction markets. In the coming decades, building codes nevertheless play a growing role to restrain additional energy demand for cooling. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 EU Japan United States Other AE China India MENA Southeast Asia Other EMDE 2035 2024 Cooling degree-day Efficiency (Wh/Wh) 0.6 1.2 1.8 2.4 2015 2024 2035 Thousand TWh Cooling demand Efficiency of AC units sold 5 kWh/m² 10 kWh/m² IEA.

This rate marks a slowdown compared with the last decade, during which energy demand in industry was up by an average of 1.5% per year and contributed 40% to the overall increase in global total final consumption. Today, non-energy-intensive industries account for less than a third of industrial energy demand and generate around two-thirds of industrial value added. In the STEPS, those industries increase production rapidly and are responsible for over half of energy demand growth to 2035. Energy-intensive industries experience less rapid increases. Steel and cement production rise by 1% and 0.6% respectively per year to 2035 (Figure 4.14), reflecting weaker domestic demand in China and advanced economies, while primary chemicals production, e.g. ammonia, methanol and high-value chemicals, and aluminium production both increase by around 2% per year as they substitute for other materials and respond to new demands, including those arising from the production of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and EVs. 4 Energy-intensive industries include iron and steel, non-metallic minerals, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, and paper, pulp and printing. 3 6 9 12 2005 2015 2025 Annual energy savings EJ Heating: Cooling: AE China Other EMDE 100 200 300 400 2000 2024 2050 Floor area by compliance with building codes Billion m² ZCRB Compliant Non-compliant Retrofit IEA.

Chemicals and aluminium production are the main drivers of energy-intensive industry growth, while light industries see the fastest growth and boost industry value added Note: PPP = purchasing power parity; Gt = gigatonnes. Growth in industrial production is largely concentrated in emerging market and developing economies, where energy consumption in industry is almost three-times higher than in advanced economies. In large part, this reflects China’s role as a global industrial centre, robust manufacturing industries in India and Southeast Asia, and the petrochemical industry in the Middle East. By 2035, almost all energy consumption growth takes place in emerging market and developing economies, with China accounting for around one-quarter of the total (Figure 4.15). In advanced economies, despite economic recovery and policy measures that support domestic production, energy consumption in industry does not increase significantly, with efficiency gains almost outweighing limited expansion of growth in industrial production. Coal demand in industry falls 6%, primarily due to slow growth and substitutions in coal\u0002intensive sub-sectors, mainly steel and cement. Scrap use for steel production increases with policy support, and new plants capitalise on higher scrap availability. New plants to produce iron often use natural gas instead of coal-fired blast furnaces, which cuts their share in iron production from 90% today to 84% in 2035 in the STEPS. The share of energy-intensive clinker used for the production of cement falls from 0.72 today to 0.71 in 2035 as clinker is partially substituted by other materials. Meanwhile, cement production shifts from China to other emerging market and developing economies where the average share of coal in the production process is around 40%, well below the 70% share in China. Industry sector energy demand for all fuels except coal expands until 2035. Non-energy\u0002intensive industries and chemicals drive growth in electricity demand, which rises at an annual average of 2.1% to 2035, outpacing the growth in demand for other fuels.

Despite increases in the United States, natural gas demand in industry peaks in advanced economies by 2030, mostly due to the expanding electrification of industry in the European Union as part of measures like the Clean Industrial Deal. Oil demand in industry rises by around 1.6% per year to 24 mb/d by 2035, with almost 90% of the increase reflecting increased demand for plastics, even though the recycling collection rate is up from 19% in 2024 to 24% in 2035. Figure 4.15 ⊳ Energy demand in industry by economic grouping and fuel in the STEPS, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Emerging market and developing economies drive industrial energy demand growth; electrification in industry increases in virtually all economies Notes: EJ = exajoule. Other includes geothermal, solar thermal, hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. Where low-emissions hydrogen is produced and consumed onsite at an industrial facility, the fuel input, such as electricity or natural gas, is reported as total final consumption, not the hydrogen output. Structural shifts, improved material use and technical energy efficiency temper energy demand growth in industry Although demand for industrial products continues to increase, the associated energy demand grows more slowly in the STEPS than it has over the last decade. Industrial intensity – measured as the energy per unit of value added by industry – improves at a rate of 1.6% per year until 2035, faster than the average rate of 1.1% since 2015 and notably faster than the rate since 2021 of 0.8%. Three key factors are at play.  Structural shifts occur from energy-intensive to non-energy-intensive industries, which need less energy to add value to the economy. One unit of energy consumed by non\u0002energy-intensive industries adds an average of almost ten-times as much monetary value as one consumed by energy-intensive industries.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 191 4 underway since 2014, led by China (see Chapter 3, Box 3.1). If the global proportion of energy-intensive industries in industrial value added and their structure remained static from today to 2035, energy demand in industry would be about 37 EJ (19%) higher than in the STEPS (Figure 4.16).  Technical efficiency improvements are driven both by policies – such as MEPS for motors, energy audits and funding support – and by cost-effective technological improvements. Over-capacity in some sectors and regions drives competition and stimulates improvements, while new plant additions are more efficient than existing facilities. Taken together, technical efficiency measures avoid about 5 EJ of energy demand in industry in 2035.  More efficient use of input materials reduces energy-intensive industry demand. In steel, electric arc furnaces use up to ten-times less energy than production in the blast furnaces that currently dominate production (IEA, 2020), with the exact savings dependent on the share of recycled scrap used. Clinker substitution cuts thermal energy demand in the production of cement, reducing energy demand per tonne by a factor of eight compared to conventional production. Improvements in material efficiency accelerate compared to historic rates, supported by policies in China and India for steel scrap use, targets for plastic recycling, and the availability of more materials reaching the end of their lifetime and being available for recycling. In the absence of these improvements, energy demand in 2035 would be around 5 EJ higher than in the STEPS. Figure 4.16 ⊳ Avoided energy demand from efficiency improvements in industry in the STEPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. 192 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 What is driving the Age of Electricity in the industry sector? As in other end-use sectors, electricity demand growth in the industry sector is contributing to the Age of Electricity. The industry sector adds around 260 TWh per year to its current demand for electricity through to 2035, which is roughly as much as electricity demand today in Spain. Some of this growth in demand, nearly 15%, reflects the use of new electric technologies in industry, but most of it, around 85%, stems from activity growth and structural shifts to non-energy-intensive industries. These industries use a higher share of mechanical energy and require thermal energy at lower temperatures, making them easier to electrify, and they account for three-quarters, 2 100 TWh, of industry electricity demand growth by 2035. In the machinery sub-sector, much of the increase in electricity demand reflects higher production rather than more electrification. Machinery has the highest share of electrification and the highest demand growth of all industry sub-sectors, with electricity demand increasing 50% by 2035 while the share of electrification only increases by two percentage points (Figure 4.17). However, there is scope for further electrification even in the machinery sub-sector: while its electrification rates are already over 70% in China, Japan and Korea, they are lower elsewhere, including in Europe at 55% and the United States at 60%. Figure 4.17 ⊳ Electricity demand and share of electrification for selected industrial sub-sectors in the STEPS, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity demand growth is driven by activity growth in most sub-sectors, and by structural shifts towards non-energy-intensive sectors amenable to electrification Measures to improve the use of materials tend to replace thermal energy demand with electrical alternatives, e.g. mechanical recycling for plastics instead of steam crackers; arc furnaces for steel scrap instead of blast furnaces, which have significant impact in some regions. In India, electricity use in the chemicals sub-sector more than doubles by 2035, while 20% 40% 60% 80% 0 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 TWh Chemicals Iron and steel Machinery Aluminium Food and tobacco Cement 2015 2024 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 193 4 its total energy demand increases by less than 50%. In China, the share of electricity in the steel sub-sector increases by five percentage points. As conventional energy-intensive routes remain dominant, the global effect of these shifts is limited, but it increases the share of electricity in steel production by three percentage points by 2035 in the STEPS. Policies to support industry electrification also have an impact, such as the EU Clean Industrial Deal (see Chapter 8, Section 8.4), carbon contracts-for-difference in various countries, and support for industrial heat pumps in China. The share of electricity in non\u0002energy-intensive industries increases by four percentage points in the European Union and seven percentage points in China by 2035. However, electricity demand growth has implications for infrastructure, with factories requiring new grid access or increased connection capacity, and for the provision of flexibility to unlock the opportunities from electrification. 4.4 Electricity 4.4.1 Demand Global electricity demand increased by close to 3% annually in recent years, and this rose to over 4% in 2024. China has been the dominant driver of growth in electricity demand, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the increase since 2015. Other regions, including India, the Middle East, and parts of Southeast Asia, have seen demand rise sharply, reflecting both rising economic activity and structural shifts towards increased electrification.

CC BY 4.0. 194 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 The annual growth in electricity demand of close to 3% per year over the last decade is nearly twice the rate of growth for total energy demand (Figure 4.18). Between 2024 and 2035, global demand for electricity is projected to increase at over four-times the rate of total energy demand in the STEPS. In some advanced economies, such as the European Union and Japan, electricity demand has declined in recent years, though this trend is expected to reverse in the Outlook period. Emerging market and developing economies account for around three-quarters of the additional global electricity demand by 2035 in the STEPS. China alone is responsible for 40% of this growth, maintaining its position as the world’s largest electricity consumer. India also sees demand rise rapidly, with electricity demand reaching around 5 000 TWh by 2050 on the back of sustained growth of over 4% per year between 2024 and 2050 in the STEPS. Figure 4.19 ⊳ Electricity demand by end-use, 2024-2050, and demand growth by end-use in the STEPS to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity demand increases by nearly 1 000 TWh each year, mostly driven by industry, appliances, cooling and EVs Notes: TWh = terawatt-hours. Other buildings include electric space and water heating excluding heat pumps, lighting, cooking, desalination and data centres. Other includes agriculture, non-road transport and other energy sector excluding hydrogen production. One of the main reasons behind the strong rise in electricity demand in emerging market and developing economies is their relatively low level of electricity consumption per capita. Today, electricity demand per capita averages around 2 600 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year in emerging market and developing economies, which is approximately three-times less than the average in advanced economies. However, this gap is gradually narrowing: by 2035, electricity demand per capita in emerging market and developing economies is projected to be 2.5-times lower than in advanced economies.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 195 4 of changes in emerging market and developing economies, including rising income levels, more access to electricity, increasing use of electric appliances, and the continuing electrification of the industry and transport sectors. Global electricity demand increases by nearly 1 000 TWh per year through to 2035 – equivalent to adding the electricity demand of all advanced economies combined over the next decade (Figure 4.19). This surge reflects rising demand for appliances and cooling systems, rising levels of production in the electrified industrial sector, and the accelerating pace of electrification in the transport sector. Industrial electricity use remains a major driver, accounting for roughly 30% of the growth, closely followed by rising demand from appliances and cooling. In addition, the scaling-up of hydrogen production via electrolysis adds around 400 TWh to the total by 2035, equal to around 1.5% of current global electricity demand. This scaling-up is driven by various policy instruments: such as grants and quotas in the European Union; auctions in India, Japan and Korea; tax incentives as in Brazil; or contracts-for-differences as in Germany and Japan. Box 4.3 ⊳ Demand response: unlocking flexibility in the Age of Electricity Electricity demand growth around the world in part is driven by the increasing use of technologies that can consume electricity flexibly, such as EVs and smart air conditioners. With the right regulatory and technical frameworks in place, these assets can provide demand response – the capacity to shift or reduce electricity use during peak periods – and offer valuable flexibility, serving as a fast and cost-effective buffer when supply is tight. Today, we estimate that around 100 gigawatts (GW) of demand response exists globally, primarily in the industrial sector and in countries like the United States with established programmes. Demand response is expanding rapidly in other countries and regions such as the United Kingdom and the European Union where regulation supports participation by the buildings and transport sectors, notably via aggregators and dynamic retail tariffs. In the STEPS, demand response activation, i.e. demand response capacity that is actually used, grows more than threefold by 2035, driven by higher participation from the buildings and transport sectors through smart air conditioners, heat pumps and EVs (Figure 4.20). Data centres can also provide flexibility through thermal storage, workload shifting or backup power, but high capital costs, regulatory constraints, and the need to maintain high information technology reliability limit how much their power use can be adjusted without risking service disruption. The nature of demand response is also set to evolve. It is mainly activated today during peak demand periods, triggered dynamically by system operators. By 2035, in the STEPS, flexibility is mobilised daily in response to predictable price signals to shift consumption away from evening peaks to cheaper, low-demand periods earlier in the day (Figure 4.20). With the adoption of time-of-use tariffs and smart equipment, this form of routine flexibility, especially from heating, cooling and transport, accounts for most of the energy shifted across the year in the STEPS. However, targeted response remains IEA. CC BY 4.0. 196 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 critical: at peak times, industrial demand response continues to deliver a significant share of the flexible capacity. Together, these layers of flexibility strengthen system resilience and can reduce the need for peaking capacity, as discussed in Chapter 5. Figure 4.20 ⊳ Demand response activation by sector and contribution to daily and peak activation in the STEPS, 2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Demand response increases more than threefold by 2035, and all sectors support both daily load shifting and peak management The drivers of electricity demand vary substantially across countries and regions. In advanced economies, EV adoption is the largest contributor, responsible for over 30% of additional electricity demand by 2035 in the STEPS. Demand from data centres – driven by increases in digitalisation and AI – is the second-largest by 2035, followed by electricity-intensive industries, appliances and air conditioning. In contrast, the buildings sector leads demand growth to 2035 in emerging market and developing economies. Rising levels of ownership of household appliances and increasing demand for cooling are major contributors, together with electrification in industry, notably in China, India and Southeast Asia. In the STEPS, electricity accounts for over one-quarter of total final consumption by 2035, up from 21% in 2024. Electric technologies are much more efficient than others, for example, electric cars are two-to-four-times more efficient than fossil fuel alternatives, and heat pumps are around three-to-five-times more efficient. This means that contribution of electricity to useful energy delivered to end-users is more substantial than its share of total final consumption would suggest, and in fact it provides approximately 40% of useful energy to end-users by 2035 (Figure 4.21). Some applications remain difficult or costly to electrify with current mature technologies. In energy-intensive industries, almost two-thirds of all energy use is to produce high- 100 200 300 400 2024 2035 Transport Buildings Industry Demand response activation GW Activation by timeframe, 2035 25% 50% 75% 100% Daily Peak IEA.

In the transport sector, limitations in battery energy density make it difficult to electrify aviation and shipping, which together represent around 25% of non-electric transport energy demand in 2035. Figure 4.21 ⊳ Electricity in consumption and in useful energy demand by sector in the STEPS, 2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity makes up over a quarter of total final consumption in 2035, but its share of the useful energy delivered to end-users nears 40% thanks to its higher efficiency 4.4.2 Electricity generation The global electricity mix continues its structural transformation in the STEPS, albeit at a pace largely consistent with recent trends. In this scenario, policy targets are assumed to be extended and modestly scaled up beyond their current timelines, while carbon pricing sees significant but measured increases. Continued efforts to deploy energy storage, reform power markets and streamline permitting processes support steady growth in solar PV and wind power deployment in most regions. Over the past five years, annual capacity additions of solar PV and wind have increased by around 25% per year, and the markets for these technologies expand in the STEPS by another 25% to 2035, with annual capacity additions of around 820 GW. The expansion of solar PV and wind power in the STEPS is underpinned by the continued presence of supportive policy frameworks, improvements in power system operations, investment to modernise and expand grids, and more use of distributed energy resources to help reduce curtailment and enhance grid flexibility. In the STEPS, global coal-fired power generation continues to expand in the near term, remaining the largest source of electricity until the early 2030s (Figure 4.22). It then begins a 2% 23% 38% 21% 4% 2% 9% 5% 25% 50% Transport Industry Buildings Total final consumption Share in 2024 Additional share in 2035 4% 29% 59% 31% 9% 4% 9% 8% 25% 50% 75% Electricity share in consumption Electricity share in useful energy demand IEA. CC BY 4.0. 198 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 steady decline which reflects the commitment that more than 55 countries have made to phase out its unabated use. By 2035, coal-fired generation is around 20% below today’s level, and is no longer the dominant source of electricity. By 2050, it falls to nearly 60% below its current level, though it remains a significant part of the mix in many emerging market and developing economies. Natural gas maintains a central role in the electricity generation mix: its use increases by over 15% to 2035 before gradually decreasing, and it continues to provide critical system flexibility and backup capacity. Oil-fired generation declines steadily as countries, including those in the Middle East, transition to alternative sources. Nuclear power experiences a notable resurgence, with output rising by nearly 40% by 2035 and by a further 40% by 2050, supported by policy commitments in more than 40 countries. Figure 4.22 ⊳ Global electricity generation by source in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Expansion of solar PV, wind and nuclear curb coal-fired power and reshape the global electricity generation mix Note: TWh = terawatt-hours; CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Other renewables include bioenergy and renewable waste, concentrating solar power, geothermal and marine. Other includes oil, non-renewable waste and other sources. As a result of these trends, the global electricity generation mix undergoes a major transformation in the STEPS. The share of fossil fuels declines rapidly from 60% in 2024 to less than 40% by 2035 and just 20% by 2050, and the share of low-emissions sources rises sharply. Renewables, which currently account for about one-third of global electricity generation, expand to deliver over half by 2035 and more than two-thirds by 2050. Solar PV and wind are the main contributors, with their combined share of generation increasing from 15% today to 40% in 2035 and 55% in 2050. Nuclear power maintains a share of just under 10% throughout the period. In advanced economies, low-emissions power generation rises 50% faster than electricity demand to 2035, with wind and solar PV outpacing total demand growth on their own 15 30 45 60 2000 2024 2050 Electricity generation Thousand TWh 25% 50% 75% 100% 2000202420352050 Hydrogen, ammonia Other renewables Wind Solar PV Hydro Nuclear Other Natural gas Coal Shares and CCUS Unabated IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 199 4 (Figure 4.23). While fossil fuel generation declines significantly – coal use falls 60% by 2035 and natural gas use by 5% – natural gas remains the single largest electricity source through to 2035. Nuclear energy meets almost 10% of demand growth to 2035, with its role expanding as a result of uprates at existing reactors, new construction and reactor restarts, particularly in the United States, France and Japan. Figure 4.23 ⊳ Electricity generation by economic grouping and source in the STEPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Solar PV and wind meet the bulk of electricity demand growth to 2035 in the STEPS; natural gas, nuclear and hydropower also contribute Notes: EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Other renewables include bioenergy and renewable waste, concentrating solar power, geothermal and marine. Other includes oil, non-renewable waste and other sources. In emerging market and developing economies, electricity demand increases by 50% through to 2035 in the STEPS, but low-emissions sources expand faster, increasing by over 10 500 TWh between 2024 and 2035. China alone accounts for two-thirds of this increase: the rapid growth in its low-emissions generation keeps pace with its rising electricity needs. Solar PV meets 60% of demand growth in emerging market and developing economies. Wind, hydropower and nuclear also contribute, with nuclear generation in emerging market and developing economies doubling by 2035. Gas-fired power also increases significantly, and coal remains the largest source of electricity across emerging market and developing economies in 2035, although it declines over the period. In the STEPS, the global share of low-emissions electricity rises from 40% in 2024 to over 60% by 2035, driven by supportive policies, maturing supply chains and improving cost competitiveness (Box 4.4). By 2024, 143 countries had established targets to promote expansion of renewable electricity (REN21, 2025), which sets the background for policy 8 16 24 32 2024 2035 2024 2035 Hydrogen, ammonia Other renewables Wind Solar PV Hydro Nuclear Other Natural gas Coal Advanced economies Thousand TWh EMDE and CCUS Unabated IEA. CC BY 4.0. 200 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 support. Most regions see the share of low-emissions sources in electricity rise to over 50% by 2035, with notable exceptions in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, though both regions make substantial progress (Figure 4.24). The European Union sees large contributions from nuclear, wind and solar PV, while Central and South America benefits as the region with the world’s highest share of hydropower. The most significant gains in low-emissions shares – over 25 percentage points – are in Australia, India, China, Africa, Japan and Korea. Figure 4.24 ⊳ Share of low-emissions sources in electricity generation by region in the STEPS, 2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Low-emissions sources take a larger share of the electricity mix in all regions with renewables leading the way underpinned by low costs and widespread policy support Notes: C & S America = Central and South America. CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Other renewables include bioenergy and renewable waste, concentrating solar power, geothermal and marine. Solar PV expands rapidly in most markets, supplying one-quarter or more of total electricity generation in Australia, China, India and the European Union in 2035, and making swift progress in Africa and the Middle East. Both onshore and offshore wind also expand rapidly, notably in Europe. Hydropower continues to play a central role in Central and South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, though the output from many individual projects is expected to decline as average temperatures increase. Geothermal energy remains a small part of the electricity mix to 2035, though innovation is expanding its potential (IEA, 2024). Meanwhile, low-emissions hydrogen and ammonia begin to gain traction in power generation in the form of hydrogen blended with natural gas and ammonia co-fired with coal particularly in Japan and Korea. Nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence, with over 40 countries now pursuing policies to expand its role in the electricity generation mix.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 201 4 generating renewed optimism. This momentum follows a challenging period marked by delays and cost over-runs in several high-profile projects in Europe and the United States. Globally, nuclear power output doubles to 2050 in the STEPS, maintaining a stable 9% share of electricity generation but falling well short of global initiatives to triple capacity. In the European Union, share of nuclear generation dropped from one-third in the late 1990s to 23% in 2024, and is projected to fall to 17% by 2035. The United States sees steady nuclear output to 2030, followed by strong growth that boosts its share from 18% today to over 20% in the long term. The nuclear share in the generation mix is also rising in Japan, Korea, India, Africa, Russia, Middle East and Brazil. In China, the nuclear share also edges up, outpacing soaring electricity demand, as the size of the nuclear fleet becomes the largest in the world in the early 2030s and it accounts of nearly half of global nuclear expansion to 2050. Box 4.4 ⊳ Competitiveness of solar PV, wind and battery storage Since 2010, the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) has declined by 90% for solar PV, 70% for wind generation and 90% for batteries, driven down by innovation, manufacturing gains and improved performance. Costs are projected to decline further by about 40% for solar PV, 30% for batteries and about 10% for onshore wind from 2024 to 2035. In the STEPS, projected LCOEs for 2035 show that new solar PV, onshore and offshore wind have similar or lower average generation costs than new coal, gas and nuclear in the United States, European Union and China. However, assessing the competitiveness of power technologies requires looking beyond LCOE to the value these technologies provide to power systems. While LCOE captures all technology costs, i.e. construction, operation and maintenance, fuel and CO2 emissions (where they have a price), it does not reflect when electricity is produced, its contribution to system adequacy and stability, or its ability to provide flexibility. The value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), developed for and used in the IEA Global Energy and Climate Model accounts for these factors, offering a more complete metric, though it does not assign grid expansion costs to individual technologies and does not include emissions that are not priced in markets (IEA, 2025b). The VALCOE can also be compared to system average generation costs as an indicator of affordability (Figure 4.25). The increasing competitiveness of solar PV and wind power has played an important part in their rapid expansion in many markets. A full assessment of their competitiveness depends on the value they bring to the system, which is influenced by weather variability and the cannibalisation effect. This effect, in which simultaneous output from many projects puts downward pressure on market prices and, in turn, their market value, is already evident in several markets with more and more hours of negative prices (IEA, 2025c). As a result, by 2035, pairing solar PV with four-hour battery storage, e.g. 20 megawatt (MW)/80 megawatt-hour (MWh) of battery storage paired with 100 MW of solar panels, becomes more competitive than standalone PV in major markets, as the added value of dispatchability outweighs the additional cost.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 203 4 It is technically feasible to combine solar PV, wind and battery storage to operate at an average capacity factor of 95% throughout the year, effectively providing power for 24 hours per day, seven days a week (24/7), comparable to what dispatchable sources of electricity can offer. Achieving this level of reliability from solar PV and wind installations requires system oversizing and storage to manage weather variability. For example, to be able to deliver 100 MW firm capacity, a project might include 600 MW of solar PV and 400 MW/1 600 MWh of battery storage behind the same inverter. Despite significant amounts of surplus electricity above 100 MW, (curtailed in this example, but potentially available for other uses if a grid connection is available), such a system could reach a value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity of around USD 75/MWh in China, USD 135/MWh in the United States and USD 180/MWh in the European Union, which is comparable to some dispatchable sources. Including onshore wind in hybrid projects could reduce these costs by 10–45%, making them competitive with coal, gas and nuclear, and similar to average generation costs in 2035. This level of availability and cost would make solar PV plus storage and hybrid projects attractive for the grid, or consumers that require 24/7 electricity, including industrial applications and data centres (IEA, 2025c). Natural gas-fired power generation shows diverging regional trends (Figure 4.26). In the United States, gas use in the power sector continues to rise in the medium term before entering a gradual long-term decline, while the European Union sees significant reductions in gas-fired generation as it pursues ambitious renewable energy targets and seeks to reduce reliance on imported gas. In contrast, natural gas use continues to rise in emerging market and developing economies, with particularly strong growth in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa, where its plays a key role to meet rising electricity demand. Coal-fired power is approaching a turning point after decades of growth, with global trends increasingly shaped by developments in Asia. In China – the world’s largest coal consumer – the rapid scaling-up of renewables and nuclear leads to coal generation reaching a peak by 2030. India is on a similar path, with rapid renewables deployment putting it on track to see coal use peak around the same time. However, coal-fired generation in Southeast Asia is projected to continue to rise through to 2040. Meanwhile, many other countries are actively phasing out unabated coal-fired power generation. The United Kingdom ended it in 2024. The European Union has made notable progress towards this goal, with Slovakia joining Belgium, Austria, Sweden and Portugal in achieving coal-free electricity generation, while Ireland targets a phase-out by the end of 2025. In Southeast Asia, the updated power plan in Viet Nam targets a full coal-phase out by 2050 through fuel switching to biomass or ammonia, while Indonesia has banned new coal plants not already planned and aims for a full phase-out by mid-century. Transition credit schemes are emerging as a financial tool to support efforts to shift from high-carbon sources, including coal, to low-carbon sources. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 204 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Figure 4.26 ⊳ Electricity generation by fuel and region in the STEPS, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Natural gas remains a leading source of electricity generation; coal sees a steep decline, with over 55 countries aiming to phase it out; and oil continues to decline Note: TWh = terawatt-hours; C & S America = Central and South America. Oil use in the power sector is already at a relatively low level and is set to decline rapidly in the coming years in the STEPS, with particularly steep reductions in the Middle East as countries like Saudi Arabia pursue their 2030 energy transition goals. Across the Middle East and North Africa, this shift could free up significant volumes of oil and gas for export, with major implications for global markets and regional revenues. In Africa, however, oil remains an important source of electricity generation, especially for expanding access in remote and underserved communities. In most other regions, oil-fired generation is limited and typically confined to isolated areas where alternatives are not yet viable. Dispatchable sources of electricity continue to play a vital role to ensure power system reliability and flexibility at a time when electricity demand is rising fast (Figure 4.27). Coal\u0002fired power remains the largest dispatchable source worldwide until 2035, with capacity set to peak at around 2 500 GW in the early 2030s, driven by new construction in China, India and Southeast Asia. Natural gas-fired capacity also sees robust growth and overtakes coal, though supply constraints and long wait times for turbines are emerging in some fast\u0002growing data centre markets. Among low-emissions options, hydropower remains the largest dispatchable source, followed by nuclear and bioenergy. Battery storage sees a major breakthrough in the STEPS, adding 1 700 GW to 2035, which comes close to matching the new capacity of all other dispatchable sources combined. It plays a critical role in providing short-term flexibility, while seasonal balancing continues to rely on hydropower and thermal generation (see Chapter 5). 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 2015 2024 Thousand TWh North America European Union Japan and Korea China Southeast Asia C & S America Middle East Africa Oil 2050 India Rest of world 3 6 9 12 2015 2024 Coal 2050 2 4 6 8 2015 2024 Natural gas 2050 IEA.

Other renewables include bioenergy and renewable waste, concentrating solar power, geothermal and marine. Other includes oil, non-renewable waste and other sources. Renewables are set to expand significantly in the STEPS. Their installed capacity nearly triples by 2035, raising the renewables share of global electricity generation from one-third in 2024 to over half. Solar PV and wind continue to lead the way, with solar PV capacity projected to increase more than fourfold to 2035 with annual additions reaching around 650 GW. Accelerated repowering programmes for solar PV could enable energy outputs to increase still further (Box 4.5). Wind capacity increases two-and-a-half-times by 2035, with particularly robust growth in the European Union offshore wind sector and China onshore wind installations. There are also repowering opportunities for onshore wind, particularly in the United States and Europe which have numerous ageing installations: these could boost capacity and output at existing sites, though permitting and licensing processes may need to be streamlined. Box 4.5 ⊳ Accelerated solar repowering could boost the market Solar repowering refers to the process of replacing ageing or underperforming solar PV systems to increase electricity production, extend the system operational lifetime and improve the return on investment. There is mounting evidence that solar panels installed in the early 2010s, particularly in utility-scale projects, are now being replaced in many instances after just 10-15 years of operation because the technology is outdated or their performance has degraded. Today, solar panels are 40% more efficient than those from 3 6 9 12 2000 2024 Battery storage Hydrogen, ammonia and CCUS Other renewables Hydro Nuclear Other Natural gas Coal Dispatchable sources Thousand GW 2035 2000 2024 Wind Solar PV Variable sources 2035 Variable Dispatchable of which, unabated IEA. CC BY 4.0. 206 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 2010, so replacing old panels while reusing existing infrastructure can increase energy output in a cost-effective way. Replacing solar panels once after 10 to 15 years instead of operating them for 20 to 30 years could reduce the overall LCOE by up to 20% under good conditions (Joel, Woodhouse and Bulović, 2019). Figure 4.28 ⊳ Global solar PV panel market in the STEPS and with accelerated repowering, 2010-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Shortening the replacement schedule for solar PV panels could drive further market growth, expanding it by up to 55% in 2035 without raising operational solar capacity According to our analysis, an accelerated repowering schedule could lead to a substantial increase in the size of the solar PV panel market, benefiting from the current oversupply of solar products (Figure 4.28). Without increasing the total installed capacity in the projection period to 2050, an accelerated repowering schedule for solar PV power around the world could increase the solar PV panel market size by up to 60% in 2035 compared to the level in the STEPS, and double it by 2040, sustaining continued long\u0002term market growth. The accelerated repowering schedule would also raise the average performance of the solar PV fleet, due to faster stock turnover and uptake of higher efficiency panels. For example, a 2% absolute increase in the average efficiency of a panel would result in over 10% higher electricity output from each panel with the same rated capacity. By 2035, that would mean up to 15% higher electricity output from solar PV globally. Repowering solar projects could also increase the total capacity for a given amount of space, though this may require upgrades to inverters, cabling and grid agreements, or may be restricted by regulatory capacity limits. Repowering might also require existing contracts to be reviewed, which could risk the loss of preferential tariffs. 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 GW STEPS Solar repower IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 207 4 4.4.3 Electricity grids Electricity grids are the backbone of modern power systems and will remain essential to ensure energy security, particularly in the emerging Age of Electricity. As electricity demand increases and energy transitions accelerate, grids must be modernised and expanded to connect new sources of generation such as wind and solar PV to demand centres in a timely and reliable manner. While distribution lines continue to make up over 90% of total grid length, transmission lines are a particular focus of attention because they need to be expanded to accommodate renewables, which are often located far from existing infrastructure. In the STEPS, global grid lengths increase by 30% between 2024 and 2035, reaching 110 million km, and by another 35% by 2050. Advanced economies see a 10% grid expansion by 2035, while emerging market and developing economies expand their grids by 40% over the same period. In parallel, ageing infrastructure must be replaced – nearly 20 million km by 2035 and another 30 million by 2050 – with advanced economies facing the most urgent needs due to the age of their existing assets (see Chapter 3). Achieving this transformation is not without challenges. Grids are becoming more complex, and long lead times for grid development, often over a decade for major transmission projects, are already causing delays, with swelling connection queues for renewables and long wait times for new grid connections (IEA, 2025d). More proactive planning processes, regulatory frameworks that support anticipatory investment, and an expansion of performance-based regulation could all help address the problems (IEA, 2023). Meanwhile supply chain constraints are tightening, especially for critical components like transformers, which have seen prices and delivery times nearly double in recent years (IEA, 2025d). These constraints also extend to raw materials. For example, grid expansion is a major driver of copper demand, and current project pipelines suggest a potential 30% shortfall in copper supply by 2035 (IEA, 2025e). Overcoming these hurdles is vital to ensure that electricity grids can support secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply. 4.5 Fuels The share of fossil fuels in global energy demand was around 87% in the 1970s and now is around 79%. In the STEPS, it drops to around 70% in 2035 and to less than 60% in 2050. Fossil fuel use in advanced economies has fallen by around 10% over the past decade, while it has increased by around 25% in emerging market and developing economies. In the STEPS, demand falls by around 15% in advanced economies to 2035 and increases by around 1% in emerging market and developing economies: the net effect is that global fossil fuel demand declines by more than 4% to 2035 (Figure 4.29). Global oil demand reached 100 mb/d in 2024. In the STEPS, it increases to a peak level of 102 mb/d around 2030. It then gradually falls, and by 2035 it is back to around its 2024 level, with notable reductions in demand from passenger cars and the power sector, more than offset by increases from petrochemicals, aviation and other industrial activities. On the supply side, increases from the Middle East, Central and South America, and North America IEA.

Figure 4.29 ⊳ Fossil fuel demand in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Demand for coal peaks before 2030 and for oil around 2030. Natural gas reaches its maximum level around 2035 and then levels off. Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; tce = tonne of coal equivalent. Natural gas demand expands from 4 250 bcm today to 4 750 bcm in 2035 and it remains around this level thereafter in the STEPS. To 2035, declining demand in advanced economies is more than offset by increased demand in the industry and power sectors of emerging market and developing economies in Asia and the Middle East. Coal demand rose to around 6 100 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2024 – a record high. It remains around this level for a few years before starting to decline. By 2035, demand is around 20% lower than in 2024, a drop of 1 200 Mtce. Coal demand in China falls by more than 800 Mtce to 2035, which is around the total level of coal demand in advanced economies in 2024. 4.5.1 Oil Demand Oil demand rises from 100 mb/d in 2024, peaks around 2030, and then declines to 100 mb/d by 2035. It subsequently falls by around 0.2 mb/d each year on average from 2035 to 2050. China was responsible for more than 75% of the increase in global oil demand between 2015 and 2024, and today it consumes around 16 mb/d. The electrification of road transport in China is the main reason for the global peak in oil demand in the STEPS: half of passenger car 20 40 60 80 100 120 2000 2050 Oil (mb/d) 2024 Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies International bunkers 1 2 3 4 5 6 2000 2050 Coal (billion tce) 2024 1 2 3 4 5 6 2000 2050 Natural gas (thousand bcm) 2024 IEA.

As a result, oil demand in China peaks in the STEPS before 2030 and falls to around 15 mb/d by 2035. Oil demand in India increases by 2 mb/d to 2035 – the largest increase in any country – and continues to rise through to 2050. The next largest increases to 2035 are in Africa (1.2 mb/d), and Southeast Asia (1 mb/d). In the Middle East, falling oil use in the power sector (1.4 mb/d) is more than offset by growth in petrochemical feedstock and road transport. Figure 4.30 ⊳ Global oil demand by end-use and region in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electrification of road transport is the primary cause of the peak in oil demand around 2030; oil use remains more resilient in petrochemical feedstock and aviation Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; Other industries = industry sector excluding petrochemicals; Other = other non-energy use, other energy sectors, power, agriculture, other transport. Excludes biofuels. Oil demand in advanced economies fell by around 1.5 mb/d between 2015 and 2024, and it falls by a further 5.3 mb/d to 2035 in the STEPS. Declines in demand are slowest in North America, 6% to 2035, and fastest in the European Union at 30% (Figure 4.30). The largest increases in demand for oil globally to 2035 are for its use as petrochemical feedstock (up by 3.3 mb/d to 2035), and in aviation (2.2 mb/d). The largest declines in oil demand reflect its displacement in cars (2.6 mb/d), and in the buildings sector (1.3 mb/d). Supply Oil supply peaks around 2030 in the STEPS and returns to 2024 levels in 2035. Increases in output by countries in the Middle East, Central and South America, and North America to 2035 are largely offset by declines in mature producers including Europe, Russia and Mexico (Figure 4.31). The share of OPEC+ in global oil supply remains around today’s level of 50% to 2035 in the STEPS before increasing to 53% in 2050 as a result of rising supply from the Middle East. 25 50 75 100 2000 2024 2050 Cars Road freight Aviation Petrochemicals Other industries Buildings mb/d By sector Shipping Other 20 40 60 80 2000 2024 2050 Advanced economies Emerging market and developing economies By region IEA.

Middle East oil production supports robust supplies of NGLs, while the multidecadal contraction in the conventional crude oil share continues Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; C & S America = Central and South America; NGLs = natural gas liquids; EHOB = extra-heavy oil and bitumen. Middle East total oil supply increases by 2 mb/d to 2035, with the output of natural gas liquids (NGLs) increasing by over 2.5 mb/d over this period. Half of the increase in oil supply comes from Saudi Arabia, and it is derived from liquid-rich gas fields, including the unconventional Jafurah field, and its legacy onshore crude oil supergiant fields. Qatar increases production by close to 1 mb/d, most of which consists of NGLs from its supergiant North Field (Figure 4.32). The United Arab Emirates increases supply by around 0.5 mb/d to 2035 from 4 mb/d in 2024 following the expansion of its legacy fields and the capture of increasing amounts of NGLs from natural gas processing. In Central and South America, the continued development of the Stabroek block in Guyana, the further expansion of the pre-salt ultra-deepwater fields in Brazil, and the ramp up of tight oil resources in Argentina, mean that their aggregate supply increases from 5 mb/d in 2024 to 7.5 mb/d to 2035. Suriname starts production from its offshore fields in the late 2020s, and production rises to 0.3 mb/d in 2035. In the United States, oil supply in 2035 is 21.5 mb/d, slightly higher than in 2024 (21 mb/d). The United States remains the world’s largest oil producer to 2050. Canada adds 0.8 mb/d to 2035, supported by pipeline expansions that facilitate debottlenecking and increased NGL volumes from shale plays. Supply in Mexico fell marginally in 2024 to 2 mb/d. While new projects such as Trion, Polok\u0002Chinwol and Zama are expected to start by 2030, overall production still declines by 0.8 mb/d 20 40 60 80 100 2000 2050 Middle East North America Eurasia Asia Pacific C & S America Africa Europe mb/d 2024 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 2000 2050 Onshore Offshore NGLs Tight oil EHOB & other 2024 By region By category IEA.

Figure 4.32 ⊳ Change in oil supply in selected producing countries between 2024 and 2035 in the STEPS IEA. CC BY 4.0. Supply increases to 2035 come mainly from countries in the Americas and the Middle East, and falls from mature producers Supply in Europe falls from 3.8 mb/d in 2024 by 1.4 mb/d to 2035. Despite the start-up of the Johan Castberg field in 2025, supply from Norway falls from 2 mb/d in 2024 by about 40% to 2035. Output in the United Kingdom falls by 35% as ageing fields face high decline rates. Supply in Nigeria falls from 1.6 mb/d in 2024 by 0.3 mb/d to 2035. Supply in Algeria also contracts by 0.3 mb/d. Namibia and Uganda post the largest increases in Africa, 0.3 and 0.2 mb/d each, with Uganda expected to achieve its first oil in 2027 from projects in the Lake Albert Rift Basin. Russian supply contracted by 0.3 mb/d in 2024 to close to 11 mb/d, lower than before its invasion of Ukraine. Sharp declines in oil revenues in 2024 created major profitability challenges that are undercutting on-going capital commitments; some large projects already face delays, e.g. the Vostok Oil project. Production falls by around 1 mb/d to 2035. China is currently the world’s fifth-largest oil producer at 5 mb/d, having increased supply by around 7% over the past decade. The resource base in China is maturing, and production falls by 0.7 mb/d to 2035 because the oil price in the STEPS is not sufficient to incentivise large\u0002scale development of its tight oil resources. Iran increased supply by more than 0.4 mb/d in 2024 to 4.7 mb/d, but output contracts marginally to 4.5 mb/d in 2035. -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Guyana Saudi Arabia Brazil Qatar Canada Argentina United States Venezuela China Norway Mexico Russia mb/d IEA. CC BY 4.0. 212 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Refining In the STEPS, demand for refined products peaks before 2030 at 86 mb/d, around 0.7 mb/d above 2024 levels, and demand in 2035 is 85 mb/d. By 2050, accelerating declines in gasoline and diesel consumption outweigh continued growth in refined petrochemical feedstock and jet fuel. This presents a major challenge for the refining industry, since it marks an end to the many years of steadily rising demand for road transport fuel that have been the bedrock of refinery profitability. Peak demand for vehicle gasoline and diesel is reached in the next few years. Demand for middle distillates is more robust with continued growth in demand for jet kerosene (Figure 4.33). Increasesin fractionated NGLs supply and biofuels minimise the need for new refinery capacity to meet demand growth through to 2035. Of the 3.3 mb/d increase in petrochemical feedstock demand to 2035, more than half is met by non-refined fuels. After 2035, however, shrinking NGLs supply means demand will increasingly be met by refined products. Figure 4.33 ⊳ Demand for selected refined and fractionated products in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. As demand for road transport fuels contracts, aggregate demand for petrochemical feedstock expands Notes: mb/d= million barrels per day; LPG = liquefied petroleum gas. Diesel, gasoline and kerosene include transport use only; naphtha, LPG and ethane include petrochemical use only. Despite weak demand growth for refined products in the STEPS, 6 mb/d of new refining capacity comes online in the period to 2035, which is largely offset by 5 mb/d of closures. This new capacity is located mainly in Asia, especially China and India, and to a lesser extent in the Middle East. The on-going shift towards large, integrated refining and petrochemical complexes continues, benefiting from economies of scale and lower operating costs. Refinery closures are largely concentrated in Europe and the United States, where ageing facilities face higher operating costs. In China, capacity remains flat through to 2035, with the commissioning of large, integrated refineries offset by the phasing out of smaller and ageing plants. 10 20 30 2015 2024 2035 2050 Diesel Gasoline Kerosene Transport fuels (mb/d) Petrochemical feedstock (mb/d) 3 6 9 2015 2024 2035 2050 Naphtha LPG Ethane IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 213 4 Trade In the STEPS, trade flows increasingly shift towards emerging market and developing economies in Asia. Less than 60% of global net trade of oil was to these countries in 2024; this figure reaches 65% in 2035 and exceeds 75% in 2050. China remains the largest net importer of oil to 2050, absorbing more than a quarter of global oil trade, but imports fall by 1 mb/d to 2035. India emerges as a strong demand hub, with a 50% increase in imports reaching around 7 mb/d in 2035. Southeast Asia imports rise by 1.5 mb/d between 2024 and 2035, while Japan and Korea imports fall by 0.6 mb/d. Figure 4.34 ⊳ Net oil trade for selected major exporters and importers in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. New trade dynamics emerge as Eurasian supply loses ground, non-OPEC supply picks up, and Asian countries dominate the long-term demand Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; CSAM = Central and South America. The Middle East maintains its position as the dominant net exporter in the STEPS, exporting almost three-times more than the next largest exporter in 2035. Supply increases by 1.5 mb/d by 2035, and efforts to cut domestic demand for power generation avoid the use of about 1.5 mb/d of oil that is then freed for international trade. North American exports increase by more than 2 mb/d to 2035, although Mexico soon becomes a net importer. Africa also becomes a net oil importer in aggregate as increased production from new producers, including Uganda and Namibia, is more than offset by declining production from mature producers, mainly Algeria, Angola and Nigeria, and by increased demand. Russia and Caspian see a near-20% decline in export volumes to 2035 (Figure 4.34).

CC BY 4.0. 214 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 4.5.2 Natural gas Demand In the STEPS, natural gas demand grows at an average of 50 bcm per year between 2024 and 2035. Demand reaches just under 4 800 bcm in 2035 and then remains around this level through to 2050. Long-term natural gas demand growth is kept lower than in recent decades by the expanding deployment of renewables, efficiency gains and electrification of end-uses. Demand for natural gas in advanced economies declines from 1 850 bcm in 2024 to 1 750 bcm in 2035. In the European Union, natural gas demand peaked in 2010, and it has fallen by around 20% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the start of 2022, to a level of around 330 bcm in 2024. Demand falls by a further 20% between 2024 and 2035, to 260 bcm, as stated policy measures take effect that reduce gas imports and lower the share of gas in the electricity generation mix. Gas demand in Japan peaked in the early 2010s and now stands at around 90 bcm: it falls by 3 bcm by 2035. US domestic gas demand was 940 bcm in 2024 and it levels off before 2035. Figure 4.35 ⊳ Global natural gas demand by sector and region in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Natural gas demand growth levels off in the mid-2030s, with reductions in North America and Europe more than offsetting increases in Asia Pacific and Middle East Note: bcm = billion cubic metres; Int. bunkers = international bunkers. Demand for gas in emerging market and developing economies increases from 2 400 bcm in 2024 to 2 950 bcm in 2035 (Figure 4.35). Half of this growth comes from emerging market and developing economies in Asia, led by China with 160 bcm of growth, and most of the remainder from the Middle East. By 2035, the Middle East accounts for just under 20% of global gas use in the power sector, up from 15% today. 2 000 4 000 6 000 2000 2035 2050 Power Industry Buildings Transport Other bcm 2000 2035 2050 Asia Pacific North America Middle East Eurasia Europe Africa Central Int. bunkers By sector By region and South America 2024 2024 IEA.

Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 215 4 Supply Growth in natural gas supply is led by the Middle East and the United States in the STEPS through to 2035, with their combined output increasing by close to 450 bcm (Figure 4.36). A number of gas producing countries, including Australia and Norway, see their output decline as fields mature in the period to 2035. Figure 4.36 ⊳ Natural gas by producing country in the STEPS, 2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The Middle East and United States drive growth in global gas supply to 2035, and they add around 250 bcm to their combined export capacity The United States maintains its position as the world’s largest natural gas producing country. Production rises by 150 bcm to 2035 before declining to 2050. Domestic demand increases at a slower pace than supply to 2035 and then falls faster than supply to 2050, leaving room to develop additional export capacity: the share of US natural gas produced for export rises from 12% today to 20% in 2035 and 30% in 2050. The Middle East sees the largest growth in supply in the STEPS to 2035, led by Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar natural gas production increases by 70% between 2024 and 2035, with nearly all of the 120 bcm growth earmarked for export. Natural gas production falls in Russia from 680 bcm in 2024 to 670 bcm in 2035, while net exports fall by 10% over the same period. Declining profits limit upstream investment and production declines at mature fields such as Urengoy and Yamburg. Gas production in Europe falls by 20%, 50 bcm, to 2035, with the commissioning of new offshore developments in the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean region more than offset by decreases in other fields, notably in Norway, where production decreases by more than 30% between 2024 and 2035. 250 500 750 1 000 1 250 20242035202420352024203520242035202420352024203520242035202420352024203520242035 bcm Domestic consumption Net export United States Russia Iran China Canada Qatar Australia Norway Algeria Saudi Arabia IEA. CC BY 4.0. 216 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Trade Around 1 100 bcm of natural gas is traded over long distances each year, equivalent to a quarter of global gas demand. A little over half of this total is traded in the form of LNG. A large wave of new LNG supply is expected to come online over the next several years. After taking into account anticipated declines in supply from existing LNG export projects, global available LNG export capacity is set to rise from 565 bcm in 2024 to 830 bcm in 2030 (Box 4.6). This is much higher than the growth in demand, implying significant slack in global gas markets and putting downward pressure on natural gas prices and narrowing the spreads between key regional gas price benchmarks. This leads to significant demand response in price sensitive regions such as India and Southeast Asia. Still, in 2030, around 65 bcm of available LNG capacity is surplus to requirements in the STEPS. Based on currently announced projects, some of which come online after 2030, this surplus is gradually worked off by 2035 and by 2040 around 65 bcm per year of new LNG export capacity is required. Box 4.6 ⊳ Assessing available LNG capacity LNG liquefaction terminals often report their annual nameplate capacity, which is the maximum rated output of the plant. In practice, LNG terminals do not always run at 100% of nameplate capacity. This is because of maintenance work, unplanned outages or issues at upstream facilities, because of the time taken for newly commissioned terminals to ramp up to full capacity, and because of fluctuations in demand, for example, between seasons or as a result of a drop in market demand. In 2024, global nameplate LNG capacity was 665 bcm on an annualised basis, while actual LNG demand totalled around 560 bcm, implying a global utilisation rate of nameplate LNG export capacity of 85%. Over the last decade, this utilisation rate has varied between 75% and 85%. In our scenarios, we use a value of 85% to de-rate the nameplate capacity of existing LNG terminals in order to account for maintenance and unplanned outages, and we assume 95% utilisation rates for under construction LNG terminals once they become fully operational. These factors reduce the nameplate capacity of LNG terminals down to the available capacity. Around 290 bcm of new nameplate LNG capacity is currently under construction and is set to come online by 2030, and around 10 bcm of capacity is likely to be shut down by 2030 as plants reach the end of their technical or economic lifetime. As a result, available LNG capacity expands by around 265 bcm between 2024 and 2030, compared with 200 bcm of growth in LNG demand over this period. In 2035, more than 75% of total LNG exports flow to Asia in the STEPS, up from just under 70% in 2024. China has been the world’s most active LNG buyer in recent years, accounting for around 25% of new long-term LNG contracts signed since 2020. China increases its LNG IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 4 | Stated Policies Scenario 217 4 imports by around 55 bcm to 2035, and an additional 20 bcm of pipeline gas is imported through expansion of the Power of Siberia I and Far East pipelines from Russia. Total imports in 2035 in China reach around 250 bcm, more than double the volumes of India, the next largest importing country. China becomes increasingly influential in balancing global gas markets through to 2035 as it actively manages its portfolio of pipeline, LNG, domestic production and storage assets, backed by a mix of long-term, short-term and flexible gas contracts. Figure 4.37 ⊳ Change in natural gas supply balance in selected regions in the STEPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. LNG meets 285 bcm of the growth in natural gas demand in key importing regions Note: bcm = billion cubic metres; LNG = liquefied natural gas. In India, growth in natural gas demand to 2035 is largely met by LNG imports, which almost triple between 2024 and 2035. There are also large increases in LNG imports in other regions in Asia which need gas imports to compensate for declining domestic production and to meet additional demand growth. These include Southeast Asia, where LNG imports rise from 35 bcm today to 135 bcm in 2035, and other developing Asia, primarily Pakistan and Bangladesh, where LNG imports increase from 45 bcm to 80 bcm over the same period. LNG imports to the European Union rise from 110 bcm in 2024 to 145 bcm in 2035 to compensate for declining domestic production and a drop in pipeline supply. Total imports fall by 65 bcm from 2024 levels, tracking the fall in overall European Union demand. In Japan and Korea, LNG imports stay flat at around 90 bcm and 60 bcm, respectively. Today, the United States is the world’s largest LNG exporter, and it leads the growth of new capacity, accounting for around 160 bcm of projects under construction, 50% of the global total. These projects bring its total nameplate LNG capacity to 300 bcm per year in 2030. Its LNG exports reach 240 bcm by 2035 and its pipeline exports to 80 bcm. -100 0 100 200 China India Southeast Asia Other Asia Japan and Korea European Union LNG Pipeline Domestic production bcm IEA.

Around 20% of the increase in new LNG capacity to 2035 is from Qatar, which has approved three major LNG expansion projects since 2021, with the latest addition being its 22 bcm North Field West project, announced in 2024. Its LNG supply capacity is set to expand from around 100 bcm in 2024 to around 200 bcm in 2035. Its North Field West project, announced in 2024, could further add to its capacity. LNG export capacity in Australia stays flat, and it maintains its position as the third-largest LNG exporter throughout the outlook period. In Canada, the 19 bcm per year LNG Canada project began operation in 2025, while two smaller projects are scheduled to start before 2030. In Africa, around 40 bcm worth of new projects are under development, including the 18 bcm per year Mozambique LNG project that has seen multiple delays and is not expected to come online until around 2030. Taking into account capacity retirements, LNG exports from Africa reach around 75 bcm in 2035. Russia does not manage to replace the gas export volumes lost to Europe. There is a small increase in its pipeline exports to Central Asia, but its overall exports fall by 7 bcm by 2035, with pipeline exports to China plateauing at a level of around 50 bcm per year, up from 30 bcm today. These exports to China are supported by an increase in annual deliveries from the Power of Siberia I pipeline and by the commissioning of the Far East pipeline. The flattening of demand for gas in China in the late 2030s means that there is no need for an additional large-scale pipeline from Russia to China. Russian LNG production peaks at close to 55 bcm around 2040, far below the government target level of more than 150 bcm by 2036.

It reached a record high in 2024, in part due to a surge in electricity demand driven by increased cooling needs in China, India and other emerging market and developing economies that experienced acute heat waves. There is limited further growth in coal demand in the STEPS: it soon peaks at around 6 100 Mtce, and demand in 2035 is 20% lower than in 2024 (Figure 4.39). Figure 4.39 ⊳ Coal demand by sector and region in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Coal demand falls by 20% to 2035 and 45% to 2050, mainly from declines in power; coal demand in industry is more resilient as there are few alternatives for steel production Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent. EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; AE = advanced economies. China is responsible for more than 3 550 Mtce of coal demand today. In the STEPS, its demand falls by around 25% to 2035: this reduction of more than 800 Mtce is broadly equivalent to all of the coal used in advanced economies in 2024. Coal use falls across all main sectorsin China, with the power sector in the lead. India, Indonesia and other emerging market and developing economies in Southeast Asia see coal demand increase by 10-35% to 2035 as they tap all alternatives available to power their increasing electricity needs. Coal use plateaus in the Caspian region. In Africa, coal demand declines by around 20%, with demand in South Africa falling 30%, largely due to a 45% reduction of coal use in power. Coal demand in advanced economies falls by 50% to 2035 in the STEPS, consolidating a trend that started over a decade ago. The largest absolute decline is in the United States, where coal demand drops by nearly 140 Mtce, equivalent to Japan’s coal use in 2024. The industry sector also sees a reduction in coal use, but it is much more moderate. 2 000 4 000 6 000 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 Power Industry Buildings Other By sector Mtce 2024 2035 2050 China Other EMDE AE By region IEA. CC BY 4.0. 220 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Supply China accounts for half of global coal supply today. In the STEPS, its production falls broadly in line with domestic demand, dropping by about 25% to 2035 and by 60% to 2050. China remains responsible for around half of global coal production to 2035, but its share falls to below 45% by 2050 (Figure 4.40). Figure 4.40 ⊳ Coal supply by region and type in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. China cuts its coal output by nearly 800 Mtce between 2024 and 2035, almost as much as total coal production from all advanced economies in 2024 Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; AE = advanced economies. Around 80% of coal produced in 2024 was steam coal, mainly used for heat production or steam-raising in power plants (Figure 4.41). The global share of coal in electricity generation drops from 35% in 2024 to below 20% in 2035, mainly because the expansion of renewables generation exceeds the growth in electricity demand, and steam coal production drops by around 25% between 2024 and 2035, a reduction of nearly 1 200 Mtce. Most of the remaining coal produced in 2024 was coking coal, which is mainly used in the iron and steel industries. Steel production rises by just over 10% between 2024 and 2035 in the STEPS. There are some alternatives to the use of coking coal to make steel from iron ore, including natural gas, biochar, hydrogen and direct electrification. These alternatives are used in around 10% of iron production today, and their use is expected to increase over the next ten years. As a result, coking coal production falls by nearly 20% to 2035. Lignite and peat production, mostly used for power generation, falls by more than 50% to around 100 Mtce by 2035 in the STEPS. Two-thirds of this reduction occurs in Europe as demand from the power sector continues to fall and as several lignite mines reach the end of their lifetimes. 1 600 3 200 4 800 6 400 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 China Indonesia India Russia Other EMDE Australia United States Other AE By region Mtce 2024 2035 2050 Lignite and peat Coking coal Steam coal By type IEA.

Coal production declines in all major producing countries except India to 2035 Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; US = United States. In India, coal production increases by around 50 Mtce to 2035 as it pursues its long-term strategy of reducing coal imports and enhancing energy security. This falls short of the increase of around 75 Mtce in its demand for coal over the period, but it helps to limit growth in coal imports. In 2024, Coal India Ltd obtained environmental clearance for the Gevra mine to expand production to 70 million tonnes per year, which would make it the largest coal mine in Asia. It also announced the launch of 36 new mines over the next five years. Countries that mostly produce steam coal for export see large production declines. For example, production in Indonesia falls by around 25% by 2035: domestic demand for coal increases, but it faces a shrinking export market as nearly 50% of Indonesian coal exports go to China today. Production in Colombia drops by around 70% by 2035 as exports fall by over 85%. Production in Russia decreases by over 20% to 2035 as both domestic demand and exports decline. In advanced economies, coal production decreases by around 40% to 2035 (less than the 50% decline in demand over the same period). The decline is limited to just under 25% in Australia which is the world’s largest coking coal exporter. Production in the European Union falls by 80 Mtce to 2035, and in the United States it decreases by nearly 160 Mtce, much less than the 330 Mtce reduction seen over the past ten years. Trade Around 1 200 Mtce of coal was traded worldwide in 2024 (Figure 4.42).

Coal trade declines by around 30% to 2035 and shifts even further to the Asia Pacific region, which is already responsible for close to 85% of coal trade flows Notes: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; AE = advanced economies. Differences in historical data between exports and imports are associated with coal in transit, losses and statistical differences. In the STEPS, coal exports decline by more than 30% between 2024 and 2035, a larger drop than the overall reduction in coal demand over the period. Coal imports to China fall by around 220 Mtce: this 50% reduction outweighs the reductions in imports in all other countries combined. Coal trade within the Atlantic Basin also declines, with exports from the United States falling by around 35% to 2035, mainly as a result of lower overall demand in Europe. Coal imports increase by around 30% from 2024 levels in India. By 2035, India imports as much coal as China. Steam coal exporters see more rapid declines than coking coal exporters. For example, steam coal exports to 2035 fall by over 85% in Colombia and around 45% in Indonesia, while coking coal exports from Mongolia fall by just over 25%. Australian exports of steam coal drop by nearly 20% while its coking coal exports increase by around 5%. Mozambique is one of the few countries to significantly increase coal exports, which rise to more than 15 Mtce by 2035 as new mine developments ramp up. 4.5.4 Low-emissions fuels Low-emissions hydrogen Global hydrogen production was nearly 100 million tonnes (Mt) in 2024, of which around 85% was produced from unabated fossil fuels, and around 15% was a by-product from processes in refining and the chemicals industry. Less than 1% was produced from low\u0002emissions sources, mostly electrolysers running on low-emissions electricity and fossil fuels 200 400 600 800 1 000 1 200 1 400 2024 2035 2024 2035 Other AE Colombia United States Australia European Union Korea Japan Other EMDE South Africa Russia India Indonesia China Mtce Imports Exports IEA.

Around 80% of the 0.7 Mt of low-emissions hydrogen produced in 2024 wasfrom existing fossil fuel facilities that have been retrofitted with CCUS, and 20% from electrolysis. Nearly all of the hydrogen produced today is used in oil refining and chemicals manufacturing. Figure 4.43 ⊳ Hydrogen production by type and low-emissions hydrogen production by region in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Low-emissions hydrogen represents less than 1% of total hydrogen production today but accounts for the majority of growth from 2030 onwards Note: Mt H2 = million tonnes of hydrogen; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; AE = advanced economies. In the STEPS, total hydrogen production increases to around 125 Mt in 2035. Unabated fossil fuels remain the dominant production route, though its share drops from 85% in 2024 to around 75% in 2035. The installed capacity of electrolysers is up from 1.5 GW in 2024 to almost 100 GW in 2035. In total, 10 Mt of hydrogen in 2035 is produced from electrolysis powered by low-emissions electricity, mostly in China, Middle East and the European Union. Hydrogen production using fossil fuels with CCUS increases to 3 Mt in 2035, a fivefold increase from 2024, and takes place mainly in North America. Increases in low-emissions hydrogen help to meet new sources of demand growth rather than displacing production from fossil sources: the transport and power generation sectors together account for around half of low-emissions hydrogen use in 2035. Modern bioenergy Global bioenergy consumption increased marginally in 2024 to just over 60 EJ. The traditional use of solid biomass accounted for one-third and the remainder consisted of modern bioenergy, which includes modern solid bioenergy, liquid biofuels and biogas (Figure 4.44). 40 80 120 160 2015 2024 2035 2050 Low-emissions sources By-product Total production Mt H2 Type Region Unabated fossil fuels 10 20 30 40 2024 2035 2050 Other AE Other EMDE North America European Union China Middle East Low-emissions production IEA.

Solid bioenergy remains the most used form of modern bioenergy, but biomethane is the fastest growing to 2050 Notes: EJ = exajoule; bcme = billion cubic metres of natural gas equivalent; mboe/d = million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Transformation is the energy consumed converting primary bioenergy into usable final forms. Today, solid bioenergy accounts for 85% of modern bioenergy demand, and this share falls marginally to 75% by 2050 in the STEPS. Encompassing a range of feedstocks from forestry residues to municipal solid waste, it is mainly used in the power and industry sectors, where the presence of onsite process residues creates a natural use base. These sectors consume most of the increase in solid bioenergy production to 2035, with power generation in China and industry in India accounting between them for 30% of the overall increase. Liquid biofuels production rose to around 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) in 2024. Around 95% is consumed in road transport, with North America, and Central and South America the largest centres of demand. Demand in Brazil increases by around 0.2 mboe/d to 0.7 mboe/d by 2035 in the STEPS, supported by its Fuel of the Future law which sets new blending mandates for ethanol with gasoline and biodiesel with diesel. Despite this, liquid biofuels use in road transport remains broadly flat after 2030 as sales of EVs increase. However, total liquid biofuel use continues to rise, with around 0.3 mboe/d consumed in aviation and 0.15 mboe/d in shipping in 2035, both up from near negligible levels in 2024. The largest increases are in North America and Europe, reflecting measures such as the European Union ReFuelEU Aviation, FuelEU Maritime Regulations and Emissions Trading System, plus the extension of tax credits for liquid biofuels in the United States. Diversification of waste collection and feedstock pathways is essential as demand for feedstocks that meet sustainability criteria increases. 2 4 6 2024 2035 2050 Road passenger Road freight Aviation Shipping Other Liquid (mboe/d) 20 40 60 2024 2035 2050 Power Industry Transformation Buildings Agriculture Solid (EJ) Gas (bcme) 100 200 300 2024 2035 2050 Biogas Biomethane IEA.

This is driven by supportive policies in several countries that reflect the attractiveness of biomethane as a drop-in substitute for natural gas and its energy security benefits (Box 4.7). Box 4.7 ⊳ Energy security benefits of biogas: focus on the European Union Biogases, which include both biogas and biomethane, are homegrown resources and are consumed in the country in which they are produced. For countries dependent on imported gas, developing production of biogases can bring energy security benefits. Its development relies on policy support as production costs are currently double natural gas prices. Figure 4.45 ⊳ Impacts of biomethane production in the European Union in the STEPS, 2035 IEA.

Recent global spatial analysis by the IEA of biogas potential concluded that nearly 1 trillion cubic metres of natural gas equivalent of biogas could be produced sustainably each year (IEA, 2025f). Only around 5% of the global potential for sustainable production of biogas and biomethane is currently being used.

In Denmark, biogas accounts for 40% of overall gas demand. Biogas production in France is growing rapidly. In the European Union, the annual savings in reduced fossil fuel imports from biomethane consumption rise to USD 2 billion by 2035 in the STEPS, and the increased use of biomethane also reduces emissions and creates jobs (Figure 4.45). IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 227 Chapter 5 Implications of CPS and STEPS Between continuity and change • By 2035, energy demand in the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) is around 35 exajoules (EJ) higher than in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), a difference roughly equivalent to the current annual energy demand of the Middle East. All the extra energy required in the CPS compared to the STEPS comes from oil, natural gas and coal. • In the absence of renewed geopolitical disruptions, markets for oil and natural gas appear well supplied in the coming years. But production from existing oil fields declines at a rate of 8% per year, if no investment is made, so it does not take long for supply to tighten – especially with higher oil demand in the CPS. Around 20 million barrels per day (mb/d) of new supply from yet-to-be approved projects come through in the STEPS by 2035 to ensure a balance between supply and demand, and around 25 mb/d in the CPS. • Emerging market and developing economies in Asia, including China, are the destination for nearly 60% of the oil and gas exported globally in 2035 in both scenarios, up from 45% today. The total fossil fuel import bill for these countries rises by 40% in the CPS over the next ten years, reaching USD 1.2 trillion by 2035. Although total energy investment is marginally lower in the CPS than in the STEPS, energy prices and overall energy bills are generally higher. • Supplies of key critical minerals are catching up with demand growth to 2035 if anticipated projects come through on time, with the important exception of copper. But the high level of market concentration means that there is a risk of significant shortfalls if supply from the largest producing countries is disrupted for any reason. • By 2035, electricity is responsible for around 25% of total final consumption in both scenarios, compared with 21% today. By then, around half of global economic output depends directly on electricity, and peaks in demand are rising, exacerbated by periods of extreme heat that push up cooling use. Both scenarios show a more complex electricity system in which the increasing use of electricity underlines the vital and growing importance of electricity security. • A new IEA dataset shows that extreme weather events caused operational disruptions to critical energy infrastructure and power outages to 210 million households in 2023. Extreme temperatures driving up peak demand could lead to a loss of two-thirds of planning reserve margins in the worst affected regions, underlining the need for increased climate resilience planning and implementation. • High levels of emissions point towards a temperature rise above pre-industrial levels of 2.9 °C in the CPS and 2.5 °C in the STEPS by 2100, well above the levels targeted in the Paris Agreement.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 229 5 5.1 Overview In some respects, the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) are similar. Both describe outlooks in which energy demand continues to grow, and in which there is continued investment in all fuels and all technologies. But there are important differences that lead to divergences over time that have an impact on energy security risks, emissions and the environment, and investment and affordability trends. In this chapter we consider each of these three key elements in turn. The STEPS and CPS have the same levels of economic growth and similar energy service demand throughout the projection period to 2050. However, differences in the stringency of energy efficiency policies, in fuel mixes and in electrification result in variationsin the outlook for total energy demand. In the CPS, total energy demand increases by around 1.2% per year to 2035. In the STEPS, it increases by around 0.7% per year. Demand grows more slowly in the STEPS for a range of reasons: there is less use of fossil fuels in the electricity sector, which lowers conversion losses; increased use of more efficient electric technologies, particularly in transport; and more rapid progress on efficiency improvements. By 2035, total energy demand is around 35 exajoules (EJ) higher in the CPS than in the STEPS, which is roughly equivalent to the current annual energy demand of the Middle East (Figure 5.1). Figure 5.1 ⊳ Factors driving the difference in total energy demand, 2024-2050 and rate of demand growth by scenario, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. CPS has a slower rate of energy intensity improvements, leading to a large and widening difference in global primary energy demand over time Note: EJ = exajoule; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. More of the energy demand in the CPS is met by fossil fuels than in the STEPS. Today total demand for oil, natural gas and coal is around 520 EJ: by 2035, this rises to around 540 EJ in the CPS and falls to about 500 EJ in the STEPS. Global oil demand grows at a rate of around 600 750 900 2024 2035 2050 Other Fuel switching Transport Transport Buildings Industry CPS STEPS Total energy demand (EJ) 2% 4% Energy demand Electricity demand Annual growth to 2035 Less efficiency in in power electrification IEA. CC BY 4.0. 230 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 0.4% per year to 2035 in the CPS, while the STEPS sees a peak around 2030 and a subsequent modest decline. This puts the oil demand trajectory firmly within the range of comparable scenarios produced by other organisations (Box 5.1). While the share of electric cars in total passenger car sales increases in both scenarios, it does so more slowly in the CPS, rising from around 20% today to reach around 40% worldwide by 2035, compared with over 50% in the STEPS. Slower sales of electric vehicles (EVs) explain around 40% of the difference in oil demand between the two scenarios by 2035. Natural gas becomes the second most widely used fossil fuel in both scenarios, overtaking coal before 2035. Natural gas use in the electricity sector is around 15% higher in the CPS by 2035 than today, although its share in total electricity generation falls marginally. In the STEPS, faster efficiency improvements, higher levels of renewables deployment and output, and stronger end-use electrification together dampen natural gas demand growth in electricity generation and end-uses. Total gas demand growth averages 1% per year in the STEPS to 2035, compared to 1.3% over the past five years, and natural gas use in the electricity sector is around 10% higher by 2035 than today (Figure 5.2). Figure 5.2 ⊳ Fossil fuel demand in the STEPS and additional demand in the CPS by sector, 2010-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Oil demand is higher In the CPS as the uptake of EVs is slower; there is also higher demand for gas and coal notably in emerging market and developing economies Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; tcm = trillion cubic metres; btce = billion tonnes of coal equivalent; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Other for oil includes power and buildings. Other for natural gas includes transport. The CPS sees coal use plateau for the next few years before falling, albeit more gradually than in the STEPS. By 2050, coal use is almost 50% higher in the CPS than in the STEPS – a bigger difference in outcomes between the two scenarios than for any other fuel.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 231 5 stems from the prolonged use of coal in the electricity systems of emerging market and developing economies, notably China and India, but the United States also sees a less steep drop for coal use in power generation. Box 5.1 ⊳ World Energy Outlook projections for oil and natural gas compared with other assessments In this World Energy Outlook, global oil demand in 2050 is 113 million barrels per day (mb/d) in the CPS and 97 mb/d in the STEPS, while natural gas demand reaches 5 600 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the CPS and almost 4 650 bcm in the STEPS. These levels fall within the range of comparable scenario projections recently published by governments, companies and other international organisations. None of the scenarios used for comparative purposes is designed to meet specific goals, such as those of the Paris Agreement. However, each scenario is a product of varied methodologies, as well as differing assumptions about economic growth, global co\u0002operation, commodity prices, technology costs, relative strength of existing and planned energy policies, competition between fuels and technologies in different sectors, and rates of innovation. As a result, the outlooks differ significantly (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3 ⊳ Comparative scenarios of global oil and gas demand to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. IEA CPS is near the middle of a range of scenarios that project strong continued growth in oil and gas; the IEA STEPS sits with other outlooks that project declines to 2050 Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; tcm = trillion cubic metres. IEA CPS = International Energy Agency Current Policies Scenario; IEA STEPS = International Energy Agency Stated Policies Scenario. Reference scenarios are shown for the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) (2025); ExxonMobil (2025); The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ) (2025); and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (2025). Other scenarios include: Current Trajectory scenario from BP (2025); Walls scenario from Equinor (2025); Surge scenario from Shell (2025); Trends scenario from TotalEnergies (2025).

CC BY 4.0. 232 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 The range of assessments of future oil demand vary by around 35 mb/d in 2050. The CPS, the reference scenarios of the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) all show a rising trajectory for global oil demand, with both the EIA and OPEC projecting levels of oil demand around 120 mb/d in 2050. In contrast, oil demand remains relatively flat in both the STEPS and the reference scenarios developed by the Institute of Energy Economics in Japan (IEEJ), and by ExxonMobil. Other scenarios show sharper declines, with demand in 2050 ranging between 82 and 89 mb/d. There is more divergence among the scenarios in natural gas demand. The susceptibility of natural gas to a wider range of outcomes than oil is due in part to its higher price sensitivity, which stems from fierce competition between natural gas and other fuels and technologies across sectors. It also reflects the way in which natural gas sits at the crossroads of energy transitions, with a role that is capable of changing substantially depending on geography, timeframe and sector. The CPS has a level of natural gas demand in 2050 that is close to the US EIA, OPEC and IEEJ reference scenarios; the STEPS sits slightly below the middle of the full range of scenarios and is one of several scenarios that project a peak and decline in natural gas demand by 2050. Two other broad trends characterise both the STEPS and the CPS. First is the growing importance of emerging market and developing economies in global energy demand and energy markets, despite a continuing lack of access to modern energy services in numerous countries. Between 2014 and 2024, the share of emerging market and developing economies in global energy demand increased from around 55% to around 65%. Their share continues to rise in both scenarios, though it does so less rapidly than in the past decade because energy demand growth in China slows in the years ahead. Progress in closing the electricity and clean cooking access gaps slows in both scenarios as China, India and Indonesia near universal access, leaving countries with less fiscal room for manoeuvre and weaker policies with most of the work that still has to be done. (The implications of the CPS and STEPS for the energy access gaps are explored in Chapter 6.) Second is the trend of expanded penetration of renewables in the electricity generation mix and a higher share of electricity in total final consumption. This is visible in both the STEPS and CPS, although the rate differs. The global share of renewables in electricity generation – around 30% today – reaches around 50% in the CPS in 2035 and around 55% in the STEPS, while the share of electricity in total final consumption – around 20% today – reaches around 25% in both the STEPS and CPS by 2035. In the CPS this stems from rising demand for electricity in industry and other uses; while a faster rate of increase in the STEPs reflects a more prominent role for new end-uses of electricity such as mobility and heat (Figure 5.4). The share of electricity in total final consumption stays more or less the same in both scenarios because a faster rate of energy efficiency improvements in the STEPS offsets increased use of electricity. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 233 5 Figure 5.4 ⊳ Selected energy indicators by scenario to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Both scenarios see low-emissions sources accounting for more power generation and emerging market and developing economies increasingly dominating energy demand Note: EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. 5.2 Energy security There is no single fuel, technology or trend that dominates the narrative in either scenario. In setting energy and economic policy frameworks, governments have to navigate a complex world in which multiple sources of energy with distinct characteristics co-exist, and to grapple with both traditional and emerging security issues. Energy security has long been defined by the IEA as the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at affordable prices. This implies the need to consider a diverse set of vulnerability indicators across the energy system, including for example: the share of oil and gas transiting through maritime chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz; the increase in variable supply and peak demand for electricity; market balances and supply concentration of critical minerals; and energy security risks arising from extreme weather events that are exacerbated by continued high levels of energy-related emissions. Today, tense geopolitical situations and the uncertainties about global trade have commodity markets on edge. However, a softening of market balances may be on the horizon for a range of commodities, including oil and natural gas, and potentially for some critical minerals such as nickel and cobalt. Since there is also currently a surplus of manufacturing capacity for technologies such as batteries and solar photovoltaics (PV), a period of downward pressure on prices looks likely for the remainder of the 2020s. 50% 55% 60% 65% 70% 25% 50% 75% 100% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% CPS STEPS Electricity in final consumption Low-emissions sources in electricity generation EMDE share of global energy demand 2010 2024 2035 2050 2010 2024 2035 2050 2010 2024 2035 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 234 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Nonetheless, there is no room for complacency. The IEA scenarios show how quickly supply buffers can be eroded and oil and gas investment levels rendered insufficient. Markets can quickly be thrown out of balance, for example, by higher than expected energy demand growth, disruption to supply or a lack of effective policies to manage energy security challenges. Diversity of supply remains a cornerstone of energy security, particularly since the production and supply of some key commodities and critical minerals is highly concentrated geographically. This is as relevant for electricity and associated energy technologies such as batteries or EVs as it is for oil and gas. Electricity is increasingly important to the functioning of modern economies, and electricity systems are becoming increasingly complex. Maintaining electricity security therefore is a key priority. We explore these issues in more detail below. 5.2.1 Fuel security The continued centrality of oil and gas in both the STEPS and CPS demands vigilance on a range of risks, including those that bear on the adequacy of upstream investment to meet changes in demand, the availability of sufficient infrastructure such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and refining capacity to meet market needs, and the need for diversification of supply in the face of high levels of market concentration. Adequacy of upstream investment and resource development Declining output from existing fields is a key driver for new investment in oil and gas development. Around 90% of annual upstream oil and gas investment since 2019 has been to offset production declines rather than to meet demand growth. If no new fields were to start up and no capital expenditures were made on any current supply source, then oil production to 2035 would fall on average by around 8% per year, or around 5.5 mb/d on average, often referred to as the natural decline rate. This is equivalent to losing more than the annual output of Brazil and Norway each year (IEA, 2025a). Natural gas production would fall as well, decreasing by an average of 9%, or 270 bcm, each year, which is roughly equivalent to the current total natural gas production from Africa. In reality, investment is set to continue in existing oil and gas fields, and approved projects currently under development are expected to ramp up. Yet this serves merely to reduce the projected rate of decline in conventional sources of oil and gas supply to around 4-5% per year on average. New, yet-to-approve conventional oil and gas projects are therefore needed. In the STEPS, nearly 20 mb/d of new conventional supply comes online by 2035 to ensure a smooth balance between supply and demand. In the CPS, this rises to around 25 mb/d. For natural gas, around 1 200 bcm of new conventional supply comes from new projects in the STEPS by 2035, and this rises to close to 1 500 bcm in the CPS (Figure 5.5). Declines in existing sources of supply incorporate very sharp falls for tight oil and shale gas. Maintaining or increasing production in these fields could make a major contribution to filling the supply gap that emerges in the STEPS and CPS. However, there are limits to how responsive such fields can be, especially in the absence of higher commodity prices. (See IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 235 5 Chapter 3, Box 3.3). Spare crude oil production capacity could potentially be used to fill the gap. As of October 2025, global spare oil production capacity is around 3.5 mb/d (excluding Iran, Russia and Venezuela), 60% of which is in Saudi Arabia. However, this buffer could be quickly eroded; for example, crude oil production in Saudi Arabia increases by more than 0.5 mb/d to 2035 in the CPS. Figure 5.5 ⊳ Oil and natural gas supply by scenario to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Most investment in both scenarios offsets decline in existing fields, though the CPS requires investment in higher cost supply to meet rising demand Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Approved projects = conventional projects that received final investment decision before July 2025. Whether the current investment levels in upstream, refining and transport assets for oil and gas are sufficient to meet demand in the scenarios is a key consideration. Macroeconomic uncertainties and a drop in oil prices in 2025 are set to reduce upstream oil and gas investment in 2025 by around 5% to a total of USD 570 billion – the first reduction since the Covid-19 pandemic. Today’s level of total oil and gas investment is just under the average annual level in the STEPS to 2035. This is in part because of structural cost reductions per barrel of oil, which have been achieved in recent years thanks to increased capital discipline in the oil and gas sector, changes in the types of projects executed, and changes in the design of projects. Upstream investment in oil and gas is about 10% higher in the CPS than in the STEPS, averaging an additional USD 65 billion to 2035 (Figure 5.6). This is more than the difference in oil and gas demand between the two scenarios (demand in the CPS is 5% higher than in the STEPS in 2035). This is because the additional resources that are developed above the level of the STEPS are, in aggregate, higher cost sources of supply: investment has to be 40 80 120 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 mb/d Natural decline Investment in existing and approved projects Oil 2 4 6 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 Thousand bcm STEPS CPS Natural gas IEA. CC BY 4.0. 236 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 increasingly directed to explore and develop new fields in frontier basins, and supporting infrastructure built from scratch. In the CPS, global oil prices are 10% higher than in the STEPS at around USD 90 per barrel in 2035, and natural gas prices in the European Union and East Asia are around 30-40% higher than in the STEPS. Natural gas prices in the STEPS during this period are close to the short-run marginal cost of delivering LNG, while in the CPS they reflect the long-run marginal cost of developing new supply. These higher prices unlock investment in higher cost sources of supply, but they also feed through to upstream cost inflation which makes all resource developments generally costlier to develop in the CPS than in the STEPS. Higher rates of depletion of existing resources to meet the increase in demand also contributes to price increases. Figure 5.6 ⊳ Average annual investment in oil and natural gas supply by scenario to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. An extra USD 65 billion of upstream oil and gas investment per year is needed in the CPS, 60% of which is invested in just ten countries Note: MER = market exchange rate; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; 2025e = estimated values for 2025; UAE = United Arab Emirates. The CPS includes higher production from a range of major resource-holding countries to balance supply and demand, and OPEC+ oil production in 2050 is 15% higher, 8 mb/d, than at any point in the history of oil markets. This assumes that constraints on oil production and trade in countries currently subject to sanctions ease, but it is possible that sanctions will remain in place longer, and perhaps all the way though to 2050. In this case, the additional production would need to come from alternative suppliers, such as the United States, Canada, Brazil and large producers in the Middle East. This would require increased investment and would be likely to entail higher prices than those currently projected in the CPS. 200 400 600 800 2025e STEPS CPS Billion USD (2024, MER) Upstream oil and gas investment Additional investment in CPS (USD billion) 2026-35 Russia (12) United States (9) Saudi Arabia (3) Venezuela (3) Norway (3) Brazil (2) Australia (2) UAE (2) India (2) Mexico (2) Angola (2) Ghana (1) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 237 5 Refining and LNG Existing infrastructure is better equipped to meet the slower oil and gas demand growth in the STEPS than in the CPS. This is visible in the utilisation rates of midstream assets such as LNG terminals and oil refineries. Available LNG liquefaction capacity, taking into account retirements and maintenance, expands by 265 bcm between 2024 and 2030. While this is enough to cover near-term demand growth in both scenarios, the CPS sees a supply gap opening in the early 2030s, several years earlier than in the STEPS. In 2050, the CPS requires 340 bcm of additional annual LNG export capacity above what is in place and under construction today (accounting for retirements); the STEPS needs an additional 200 bcm of annual export capacity. Figure 5.7 ⊳ Global LNG trade and oil refinery runs by scenario relative to existing and under construction capacity IEA. CC BY 4.0. LNG projects can meet STEPS demand until the late 2030s and CPS demand until the early 2030s; refining capacity is sufficient in the STEPS, but an additional 5 mb/d is needed in CPS Note: bcm = billion cubic metres; mb/d = million barrels per day. For oil refining, the degree of surplus or deficit in practice is dependent on market dynamics in individual countries, but on a global basis existing capacity is sufficient to meet demand through to 2050 in the STEPS, while in the CPS a supply gap opens in the early 2040s (Figure 5.7). In both scenarios, demand becomes more geared toward petrochemical feedstock; this favours refineries that are closely integrated with petrochemical plants, most of which are based in Asia and the Middle East. 400 800 1 200 2015 2024 2035 2050 Current Policies Scenario Stated Policies Scenario Existing LNG capacity Under construction LNG trade (bcm) Refinery runs (mb/d) 40 80 120 2015 2024 2035 2050 Existing refining capacity Under construction IEA. CC BY 4.0. 238 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Import dependence and diversification Emerging market and developing economies in Asia, including China, are the destination for nearly 60% of the oil and gas exported globally in 2035 in both scenarios, up from 45% today. Natural gas imports in the region more than double in both scenarios to 2035 (Figure 5.8). Southeast Asia, currently a net exporting region for natural gas, shifts to a net importer over the course of the next decade: to 2035, its demand for gas rises by 30% while its gas production drops by 15%. Similar trends are projected for India, where natural gas import dependence rises from around 50% today to 70% in 2035. Additional imports also cover the full increase in oil demand growth in India to 2035. Figure 5.8 ⊳ Natural gas and crude oil net imports in selected regions by scenario to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Oil and gas imports rise significantly in emerging market and developing economies in Asia to reach 60% of global oil and gas trade by 2035 Note: bcm = billion cubic metres; mb/d = million barrels per day; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Total imports of oil and gas in the CPS are about 6% higher than in the STEPS in 2035, and 20% higher in 2050. In the CPS, emerging market and developing economies in Asia import 560 bcm of LNG in 2050, four-times more than today, and 160 bcm of long distance pipeline gas, more than double today’s level; oil imports rise to 35 mb/d by 2050, which represents 95% of their aggregate oil demand. The total fossil fuel import bill for those economies in Asia increases from USD 900 billion today to USD 1.2 trillion by 2035 in the CPS: this is 25% higher than in the STEPS, where the bill is moderated by larger substitution effects (Box 5.2). 200 400 600 800 2015 2024 2035 2050 Developing Asia European Union STEPS CPS bcm Natural gas 10 20 30 40 2015 2024 2035 2050 Oil mb/d IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 239 5 Box 5.2 ⊳ Forces driving oil substitution are stronger in the STEPS than in the CPS All major sources of energy hit record high levels in 2024. Global energy demand rose 2%, spurred by a 1.5% increase in fossil fuel demand, while electricity generation from wind and solar increased by 17%. Both the CPS and the STEPS see demand for energy services increases continuing in future years. How this translates into overall energy demand for each energy source is subject to inter-fuel competition based on costs, technologies and policies that vary by scenario. Oil demand growth in recent years illustrates some of the dynamics. Over the last decade, demand for energy services dominated by oil, such as mobility, rose by over 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) as a result of factors such as increased economic activity, rising levels of vehicle ownership and expanding population. However, there were also forces at work leading to a reduction in demand for oil through efficiency gains, for example from improvements in the fuel economy of conventional cars, or with direct substitution of oil by another energy source, as in EVs replacing internal combustion engine vehicles, or blending gasoline with ethanol, or using renewables or natural gas to replace oil use for power or in buildings and industry. Together such forces led to just under 1 mb/d of oil substitution on average between 2015 and 2024, meaning the net increase in oil demand, accounting for both additions and substitutions, was closer to 0.7 mb/d per year. Figure 5.9 ⊳ Average annual change in oil demand due to additions and substitutions by scenario, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Oil substitution is stronger than in the last decade in both scenarios, but oil demand stays flat in the STEPS reflecting gains from clean energy, efficiency and electrification Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. -2 -1 0 1 2 2015-2024 2024-2035 CPS 2024-2035 STEPS Additions Electrification Low-emissions energy Efficiency Other Net change mb/d Substitutions IEA. CC BY 4.0. 240 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Both scenarios illustrate how the dynamics might play out in the years ahead. In the CPS, growth in oil demand based on underlying activity levels is slightly stronger between 2024 and 2035 than in the previous decade, but the rate of oil substitution through efficiency, clean energy and electrification is also stronger: the annual net change in demand is just under 0.5 mb/d, which is roughly two-thirds of the increase seen in the previous decade. In the STEPS, underlying oil demand growth from increased economic activity is broadly in line with the rate of increase over the last decade, but more rapid uptake of EVs and larger efficiency gains than in the CPS is enough to keep oil demand in 2035 close to today’s levels. 5.2.2 Electricity security Electricity accounts for 21% of total final consumption, compared to nearly 40% for oil, but its importance is more significant than the numbers alone suggest. Electricity is crucial to maintain essential services such as communications and healthcare, and the digital services underpinning many sectors, including transport and logistics, retail trade and public services; households depend on it for everyday energy services; and it disproportionately powers high value-added sectors like financial services and advanced manufacturing. This means that the economic costs of electricity outages are very high. Examples such as 2025 outages in Chile in February and in April across the Iberian Peninsula affecting Portugal and Spain serve as reminders of how disruptions can cascade and affect millions (see Chapter 8). As the share of electricity in final consumption increases and power systems become more complex, electricity security is becoming more and more important. This section explores how different aspects of electricity security evolve in both scenarios. Ensuring resource adequacy is essential to electricity security Given that electricity demand and supply must match at all times, system operators need to ensure adequate resources to meet peak demand. 1 Generation capacity, transmission lines, storage technologies and flexible demand all have a part to play. The challenges that system operators face to meet increasing peak demand is becoming more complex as electrification, climate change and new consumption patterns shift demand profiles. Both scenarios see similar levels of peak demand growth to 2035, implying similar challenges to ensure resource adequacy. However, the drivers of peak demand differ (Figure 5.10). By 2035, peak electricity demand rises across all regions in the STEPS, but the largest growth is concentrated in emerging market and developing economies: the sum of peak demands in different electricity systems worldwide is projected to increase by 40% from around 4 750 gigawatts (GW) in 2024. The adoption of EVs and electrification of space heating push peak demand higher in advanced economies, while expanding ownership of air conditioners 1 Peak electricity demand refers to the highest level of electricity consumption during the year, before the activation of any demand response measures. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 241 5 and appliances helps to drive up peak demand in emerging market and developing economies. In the CPS, slower rates of efficiency improvements in appliances such as air conditioning lead to growth in peak demand that is comparable to that in STEPS, despite overall lower levels of electrification. Figure 5.10 ⊳ Peak electricity demand growth by economic grouping and selected end-uses by scenario, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Peak demand increases by 1 800 GW by 2035, largely driven by cooling, with peak levels comparable in both scenarios, but lower efficiency offsets lower electrification in the CPS Note: GW = gigawatt; Elec. = electrification; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Peak electricity demand is a key metric for assessing resource adequacy for electricity systems. Systems characterised by high shares of variable renewables must be designed to meet demand when low output coincides with periods of high demand, i.e. peak residual load. At these times, the supply mix differs significantly from the average mix across a year. Lower output from wind and solar PV is compensated for by operating dispatchable plants, such as natural gas, coal, hydro or nuclear plants, at close to their maximum available capacity, by discharging storage and by shifting load through demand response. Today most capacity adequacy in Europe is supplied from nuclear, hydro and fossil fuels; most in India and China from dispatchable fossil fuel plants, mainly powered by coal. While these sources remain critical, the picture changes noticeably in each of these by 2035 in the STEPS, with battery storage and demand response contributing around 20% of peak net demand (Figure 5.11). While resource adequacy planning largely deals with times of low renewables output, hours with very high shares of variable renewable generation can also present operational challenges. For example, system operators must ensure the system has sufficient inertia to slow frequency deviations following sudden imbalances, allowing time for control and 200 400 600 800 CPS Elec.

CC BY 4.0. 242 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 protection systems to respond and maintain grid stability. This can be achieved by keeping online a base level of synchronous generation from sources such as thermal or hydropower plants. System operators can also use synthetic inertia from battery storage or variable renewable generators with grid-forming inverters and deploy technologies like enhanced static synchronous compensators and synchronous condensers at strategic points in the grid. Figure 5.11 ⊳ Annual electricity supply mix and in peak residual load hours in Europe, China and India in 2024 and in the STEPS in 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Dispatchable power sources remain important, batteries and demand response are set to become increasingly important providers of secure capacity in peak residual load hours Notes: Other includes bioenergy, geothermal and other renewables. Hydro includes reservoir, run-of-river and pumped storage. Peak residual load is defined as the top 100 hours of the residual load, i.e. demand less generation by variable renewables, over a year. Flexibility In addition to having sufficient resources to meet peak demand, electricity systems must be flexible enough to manage variability in demand and supply, ensuring the instantaneous stability of the grid and maintaining balance every hour, in all seasons (Figure 5.12). As both variable renewable energy deployment and the electrification of end-uses increase, power system flexibility challenges evolve in scale and complexity. Short-term flexibility addresses hour-to-hour variations in demand and supply. Today, typical requirements for short-term flexibility are equivalent to around 10% of average demand in many systems. By 2035, these requirements are projected to increase by two- to seven-times in the STEPS. India and China experience a particularly rapid rise in short-term needs due to their reliance on solar PV. Europe follows a similar trajectory as China, with short-term needs reaching around 30% of average demand once the share of solar PV exceeds 25% of generation. While Europe reaches this threshold by 2050, China overtakes it in 2035. 25% 50% 75% 100% Annual Peak Annual Peak Annual Peak Other Nuclear Hydro Fossil fuels Wind Solar PV Battery Demand response Europe China India 2024 Annual Peak Annual Peak Annual Peak Europe China India STEPS 2035 IEA.

CC BY 4.0. Higher shares of variable renewables and evolving electricity demand patterns increase flexibility needs; batteries and demand response emerge as key flexibility sources Notes: DR = demand response; EV DR = electric vehicle smart charging. Short-term and seasonal flexibility needs are measured relative to average electricity demand. Electrification represents the share of electricity in total final consumption. Thermal = fossil fuels, nuclear, bioenergy, hydrogen and ammonia. Curtailment refers to the curtailment of wind and solar PV generation. Seasonal flexibility requirements are driven by longer term imbalances, e.g. weekly and monthly, caused by temperature-sensitive demand and weather-dependent generation. Such requirements vary significantly by region, reflecting differences in climate and power generation mix. In Europe, seasonal flexibility needs expand faster than overall electricity demand, driven by the electrification of heating. In India and China, rising cooling demand has a similar effect, leading their seasonal flexibility needs to also increase faster than overall demand to 2035. In the United States, seasonal flexibility needs increase in line with overall electricity demand, remaining relatively stable at around 10% of demand. In most regions, short-term flexibility needs increase more in the STEPS than in the CPS. This is largely because the STEPS sees faster uptake of variable renewables in power generation than the CPS. However, lower appliance efficiencies in the CPS also amplify demand variability, somewhat offsetting the effect of having a smaller proportion of variable renewables in the generation mix. Seasonal flexibility requirements evolve in a broadly similar manner in both scenarios. Power grids and interconnections help even out fluctuations in demand and supply by connecting generators dispersed over a wide area within and between countries and regions. Thus, they help reduce the demand for flexibility from other sources while at the same time connecting Battery EV DR DR Hydro Thermal Short term Seasonal Global flexibility supply Curtailment 2024 2035 20242035 100% 25% 50% 75% 2024 2035 2050 0% 30% 60% Solar PV share Short term 80% 20% 40% 60% 2024 2035 2050 15% 30% 45% Electrification India China Europe United States Seasonal 16% 4% 8% 12% IEA. CC BY 4.0. 244 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 further potential providers of flexibility. Ageing transmission and distribution infrastructure meanwhile presents a growing challenge to system reliability and resilience. Electricity security requires targeted efforts to modernise and digitalise grid infrastructure. Batteries and demand response measures supply the bulk of short-term flexibility by 2035 in both scenarios. Batteries are well suited to complement solar PV by charging during periods of high solar output and discharging during evening peaks. Demand response offers a cost-effective source of flexibility by shifting consumption away from peak periods by means such as flexible EV charging, or optimised use of smart air conditioners, heat pumps and power-to-heat in industry, though it depends on consumers being incentivised to participate, e.g. variable tariffs (see Chapter 4). Long-established technologies remain important for the provision of flexibility. Dispatchable hydropower remains a key low-emissions contributor, though its effectiveness depends on robust water resource management, particularly in the face of increasing drought risks. Thermal power plants too continue to play an important role to provide ramping and seasonal flexibility, though their role increasingly shifts from bulk electricity generation to the provision of secure capacity once variable renewables start to account for significant shares of total electricity generation. This change in the role of thermal plants may require updating existing contracts, technical upgrades and a shift towards more flexible assets, such as peaking plants. Curtailment also becomes an integral feature of future power systems with high shares of variable renewables. While curtailment can be the result of an insufficiently flexible power plant fleet or a congested grid, it can also serve as a cost-effective alternative to overbuilding of grid and storage infrastructure. Box 5.3 ⊳ Battery storage: a multi-tool for the electricity system Battery storage plays an increasingly important role in electricity systems, providing short-term flexibility to help integrate rising shares of variable renewables, in particular solar PV, and to meet increasing residual peak demand (battery storage is not suitable for managing seasonal variability). In addition to energy shifting, batteries can provide a broad suite of services that are essential for electricity security. Their split-second responsiveness makes them ideal providers of ancillary services such as synthetic inertia, frequency regulation, voltage support and operating reserves, as well as secure capacity to maintain the adequacy of the power supply. If placed strategically in grids, batteries can also support congestion management, enabling the deferral of investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure. This is particularly valuable in regions where the expansion of power grids lags the pace of growth in demand, electrification or the deployment of variable renewables. In 2024, 77 GW of battery storage was added globally, of which roughly 80% was utility\u0002scale and 20% was behind-the-meter, up 75% from the level of additions in 2023. China continued to lead capacity growth, followed by the United States and Europe. The rapid expansion of battery storage is underpinned by dramatic declines in cost: thanks to IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 245 5 innovation and economies of scale; lithium-ion battery prices have dropped by over 90% since 2010. Falling battery and solar PV costs, along with technology improvements, are enabling renewables-plus-storage projects worldwide. Figure 5.13 ⊳ Global installed battery storage capacity and additions, 2020-2024, and in the STEPS, 2030 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Battery storage capacity expands significantly in the STEPS Rising shares of variable renewables in power systems are increasing demand for battery storage, costs are projected to decline further, and many governments support battery storage with targets, subsidies and policy reforms. In the STEPS, global installed capacity is set to reach 900 GW in 2030 and nearly 1 700 GW in 2035, 17% of total installed dispatchable capacity, with deployment broadening from advanced economies and China to India, Middle East and Southeast Asia (Figure 5.13). In the CPS, annual growth to 2035 is still strong, with global installed capacity rising to about 1 400 GW. Impact of fossil fuel price volatility In systems heavily reliant on fossil fuel-based generation, sustained fuel price spikes, such as those witnessed during the 2022 energy crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, can significantly raise the average cost of generating electricity, and consequently end-user electricity prices. Although the mechanisms of price formation and contracting vary among countries, important indicators of an electricity system exposure to fossil fuel price volatility include the share of fossil fuels in its generation mix, and the share of plants that rely on fossil fuels purchased on international markets. In both scenarios, many regions see a decline in the share of fossil fuels in the electricity generation mix, though it is more rapid in the STEPS than in the CPS. In India, for example, coal and natural gas accounted for 75% of total electricity generation in 2022: record-level 100 200 300 400 500 400 800 1 200 1 600 2 000 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2030 2035 GW China United States Europe Rest of world Additions (right axis) GW IEA. CC BY 4.0. 246 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 prices for imported coal and natural gas saw operating costs spike, and the annual average system cost of electricity rose to over USD 150 per megawatt-hour (MWh). By 2035, a lower share of imported fossil fuels in the electricity mix in both scenarios significantly reduces India’s exposure to volatility in international fuel markets. A similar trend is observable in Europe. If wholesale fuel prices were to reach the same high levels in 2035 as they did in 2022, average system costs would increase by less than 10% in the STEPS and CPS in 2035, much less than the 40% increase seen in 2022 (Figure 5.14). Figure 5.14 ⊳ Average system cost per unit of electricity in Europe and India in 2021 and 2022, and in 2035 by scenario IEA. CC BY 4.0. In both scenarios, rising shares of renewables make systems less susceptible to fossil fuel price spikes Notes: MWh = megawatt-hour; MER = market exchange rate. Base = 2035 with 2035 STEPS/CPS coal and natural gas prices. Spike = 2035 with 2022 average coal and natural gas prices. In liberalised electricity markets, even when fossil fuels supply only a small share of annual generation, spikes in their prices can push up wholesale electricity prices and make them more volatile. This is because spot prices usually reflect the cost of the most expensive plant running at a given moment, i.e. typically a natural gas plant when renewable output is low and demand is high. In the European Union, wholesale electricity prices more than doubled in 2022 due to record high natural gas and coal prices. If natural gas and coal prices were to return to those levels in 2035, average spot electricity market prices in Europe would again double from their base case levels in both scenarios. However, this increase would be significantly smaller in absolute terms than in 2022 because the much larger share of renewables in generation in 2035 in both scenarios significantly reduces the number of hours in which natural gas plants set the wholesale price. The size of the increase would be different in the STEPS and the CPS, reflecting the faster uptake of renewables in the former, but it would be smaller than it was in 2022 in both scenarios. 50 100 150 200 20212022 Base Spike Base Spike Fixed costs Operating costs Europe USD per MWh (MER, 2024) 50 100 150 200 20212022 Base Spike Base Spike India STEPS 2035 CPS 2035 STEPS 2035 CPS 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 247 5 Shifting towards renewables and nuclear therefore can help insulate electricity consumers from fossil fuel price spikes. Although electricity systems with high shares of variable renewables may experience more weather-related variability, its impact on the annual average cost of electricity is much smaller than that of the historical volatility observed in natural gas and coal prices (IEA, 2024a). 5.2.3 Critical minerals and energy technology supply chains Critical minerals security In a time of high geopolitical tensions, critical minerals are a frontline issue for energy, economic and national security. A high degree of supply concentration and a recent raft of export restrictions underline that there are risks to security of supply, highlighting the urgent need to enhance the resilience and diversity of critical mineral supply chains. In December 2024, China restricted the export of gallium, germanium and antimony – key minerals for semiconductor production – to the United States. This was followed by announcements in early 2025 to include restrictions on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium and molybdenum and seven heavy rare earth elements. Then in October 2025, new announcements significantly expanded the scope of controls for rare earths, including five additional elements (Box 5.4), while new controls were announced on a range of battery materials(IEA, 2025b). China is not the only country to have introduced export controls. In February 2025, the Democratic Republic of the Congo announced a four-month suspension of cobalt exports to curb falling prices, which was followed by an export quota system in October 2025. Box 5.4 ⊳ China’s export controls on rare earths highlight supply chain vulnerabilities China accounted for around 90% of all refined magnet rare earth supply and 94% of the global supply of permanent magnets in 2024 (IEA, 2025b). These materials and magnets are essential for cars, wind turbines, industrial machinery and digital technologies and artificial intelligence data centres. A notable development came on 4 April 2025 when the Chinese government introduced export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements, as well as all related compounds, metals and magnets. As export volumes fell sharply in April and May, many automakers in the United States, Europe and elsewhere struggled to obtain permanent magnets, with some forced to cut utilisation rates or even temporarily shut down factories. Even after trade volumes recovered, rare earth prices in importing countries remained elevated – with European prices reaching up to six-times those in China – hurting the cost competitiveness of rare earth-based products manufactured outside China. On 9 October 2025, China expanded the list of rare earth elements to include five new materials and announced further export controls on related products, equipment and technologies. The new controls require foreign companies to obtain a licence from China to export “parts, components and assemblies” containing Chinese-sourced rare earth materials or produced using Chinese rare earth technologies. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 248 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 If 10%, around 1.5 kilotonnes, of rare earth exports were to be affected, this could disrupt the production of 6.2 million cars. The domino effects of these controls highlight the need for strengthened policy efforts to diversify rare earths and magnet manufacturing supply chains. Broadening the scope of analysis to a wider set of 20 energy-related, multi-sectoral minerals reveals additional vulnerabilities in global supply chains (Figure 5.15). These minerals underpin a range of strategic industries, including high-tech, aerospace, defence and advanced manufacturing industries. While their individual market sizes may remain modest, disruptions in supply can generate disproportionate economic ripple effects across multiple sectors. Figure 5.15 ⊳ Top producer, monthly price volatility, trade restrictions exposure and status as by-product of select strategic minerals IEA. CC BY 4.0. Critical minerals used in energy and other strategic sectors are exposed to a wide range of risks, including supply concentration, price volatility and by-product dependency Notes: Top producer is for metal refining. Volatility (January 2014 – March 2025) is considered high when it is higher than that of both oil and LNG, medium when higher than oil but not LNG, and low when lower than oil and LNG. Other information is as of October 2025. By-product dependence is when over 50% of supplies are sourced as co-product or by-product. Titanium is for titanium metal; silicon is for high purity form.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 249 5 This expanded group of minerals is exposed to several risk factors. Supply chains are often highly concentrated, with China accounting for an average of 70% of global refining capacity across 19 of the 20 minerals assessed. Price volatility is also a persistent concern: three\u0002quarters of these minerals have exhibited higher price variability than crude oil, and half have been more volatile than natural gas. In many cases, production is tied to by-products of other mining activities, limiting the ability of supply to adjust flexibly to shifts in demand. Options for substitution also remain constrained. For minerals such as tantalum, titanium and vanadium, alternatives are either technologically unproven or entail cost and performance penalties. These structural supply-side challenges underscore the need for targeted policy responses to enhance supply chain resilience and diversification. This is a pressing concern in both scenarios, though supply concentration is likely to increase more in the CPS than in the STEPS due to the advantages of incumbency in a lower price environment: weaker demand in the CPS drives lower prices, favouring incumbents that generally sit lower on the cost curve and making diversification a more challenging proposition. Figure 5.16 ⊳ Primary supply requirements for critical minerals and expected supply from existing and announced projects by scenario, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Supply-demand balances through to 2035 are improving compared to a few years ago, but major concerns remain, especially for copper Notes: Mt = million tonnes; Mt Li = million tonnes of lithium metal content; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. Primary supply requirements are calculated as total demand net of secondary supply, and accounting for losses during refining operations. The base case includes production from existing and under construction assets, and projects with a high chance of moving forward. The high production case includes less certain projects at a reasonably advanced stage of development, including projects seeking financing or permits. Supply-demand balances through to 2035 are improving compared with a few years ago (Figure 5.16). For nickel, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, expected supplies are set to catch up with projected demand growth under current policy settings, if planned projects proceed 10 20 30 Base case High production Copper Mt Expected supply: 0.2 0.4 0.6 Cobalt Mt 2 4 6 Nickel Mt 0.4 0.8 1.2 CPS STEPS Lithium Mt Li Primary supply requirements: IEA. CC BY 4.0. 250 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 on schedule. But copper remains a major concern: in the STEPS, the current project pipeline points to a potential 30% supply shortfall by 2035 caused by declining ore grades, rising capital costs, limited resource discoveries and long lead times. There is also an anticipated shortfall for lithium driven by rapid demand growth, though the prospects for developing new lithium projects look much better than for copper. In the CPS, supply balances for most minerals are eased by slightly lower levels of demand than in the STEPS, but copper remains an exception, with a persistent supply gap. Bridging the gap requires a range of supply- and demand-side measures to stimulate investment in new copper supply, reduce project lead times, promote material efficiency and substitution, and scale up recycling. Refined manganese and purified phosphoric acid (PPA) are emerging as materials of increasing importance for battery supply chains. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which rely on PPA, were used in almost half of new electric cars in 2024, up from less than 10% in 2020, while manganese-rich chemistries are rapidly gaining traction. However, supply of these key materials remains highly concentrated in China, which produces 95% of manganese sulphate and 75% of PPA: this highlights new vulnerabilities. Figure 5.17 ⊳ Refined critical mineral supply balances excluding the top supplier (N-1) in the STEPS, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. For most critical minerals, supplies from outside the leading producer are insufficient to meet demand outside the leading producer, showing high vulnerability to supply shocks Notes: Percentage notes the N-1 supply coverage. The N-1 supply excludes the production volumes from the largest producer from the total global supply, and N-1 demand excludes consumption of that country from the total global demand. China is the top refined supplier for all minerals shown in 2035 based on the project pipeline except for nickel for which Indonesia is the top supplier. Despite improving supply balances for many minerals, a high market concentration means that there is a risk of significant supply shortfalls, if for any reason, supply from the largest producing country were to be disrupted (Figure 5.17). For example, supplies of battery 96% 67% 53% 65% 35% 42% 25% 50% 75% 100% Copper Lithium Nickel Cobalt Graphite Rare earths Supply coverage excluding top supplier (N-1) Supply shortfall excluding top supplier (N-1) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 251 5 metals and rare earths from all other producing countries in 2035 would meet on average only half of the remaining demand when the supply and demand accounted for by the largest producer are excluded. This underlines the point that, even in a well-supplied market, critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions. A supply shock of critical minerals would have far-reaching economic consequences, bringing higher prices for consumers, reducing industrial competitiveness and even potentially impacting national security. In 2010, the price of rare earth elements spiked by as much as ten-fold when China held back exports. If a supply shock affecting battery metals or graphite were to result in a ten-fold material price surge, global average battery pack prices could increase by as much as 40-50%, and sustained increases could widen the manufacturing cost gap between China and other battery manufacturing regions. Prolonged disruption could also result in significant revenue and job losses for manufacturers. This emphasises the importance of targeted policy mechanisms and global collaboration to diversify supply sources, linking resource-rich countries with those possessing refining capabilities and downstream consumers. Through its Critical Minerals Security Programme, the IEA is scaling up efforts to bolster mineral security by building systems to enhance resilience against potential disruptions, supporting the acceleration of project development in diverse regions, and deepening market monitoring capabilities. Energy technologies The combined market size for five key clean energy technologies, i.e. batteries, heat pumps, electrolysers, solar PV, wind power and EVs, amounted to around USD 900 billion in 2024. EVs accounted for the largest share of the total by some margin, followed by solar PV, batteries for stationary storage applications and wind power. Tracking the diversification of manufacturing capacity of these energy technologies is an important indicator of energy security. Excessive concentration may pose a risk of supply chain disruption, whether from natural disasters, accidents, geopolitical conflicts or deliberate actions to manipulate supply or price. The installed manufacturing capacity of these technologies is highly geographically concentrated, notably in China (Figure 5.18). In 2024, China accounted for over 80% of installed manufacturing capacity in every part of the solar PV value chain, and nearly 80% for nacelles and over 70% for blades of global manufacturing capacity for wind power components. The position of China in battery manufacturing is even stronger, accounting for at least 85% of global production in all parts of the value chain, and over 95% in the case of battery anodes. Manufacturing capacity is more diversified in the case of heat pumps and electrolysers for hydrogen production. Installed manufacturing capacity, however, exceeded production in 2024 by very substantial margins for some clean energy technologies. For example, global installed manufacturing capacity of battery cells was around 3 400 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2024, but combined global demand from EVs and stationary applications was around 1 110 GWh, resulting in an IEA. CC BY 4.0. 252 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 average utilisation rate of around one-third.2 The global average utilisation rate of solar PV module manufacturing facilities was also low at around 50%. Given that the global surplus of capacity relative to present demand for these technologies is concentrated in China, itsshare in actual production is estimated to be somewhat lower than its share in installed manufacturing capacity. Figure 5.18 ⊳ Installed manufacturing capacity of selected energy technologies by region, 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Installed manufacturing capacity for selected clean energy technologies is highly geographically concentrated The evolution of installed manufacturing capacity and actual output depends on several factors, including the demand outlook for individual technologies, the extent to which policies support the localisation of manufacturing capacities, and the international trade environment. The forthcoming edition of the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives will explore the outlook for global supply chains for selected energy technologies, among other issues. 2 Excludes EV and battery stockpiling. 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Polysilicon Wafers Cells Modules Nacelles Blades Cathodes Anodes Cells North America Europe Asia Pacific excluding China China Rest of world Solar PV Wind power Batteries Heat pumps Electrolysers IEA.

Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 253 5 Box 5.5 ⊳ Embodied intelligence: material supply chains for AI Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly linked to the energy sector as data centres account for a growing share of electricity consumption (see Chapter 4). However, this is not the only way in which data centres and the energy sector are connected. Data centres are also becoming important users within broader supply chains of energy\u0002related materials and energy technologies. These supply chains, and the position of data centres within them, are not yet well understood. China dominates the production and supply of critical minerals used in manufacturing chips. It refines 95% of the high purity silicon that goes into the chips used in data centre servers and fibre optic cables. With a 44% market share, it is also the leading global producer of refined copper, which is critically important for the power transformers, electrical wiring and on-chip electrical circuits in data centres. As progress in shrinking the 2D footprint of transistors stalls, the industry is turning towards 3D stacking of chip components, and this may increase the copper intensity of advanced chips. China also accounts for 99% of global refined gallium, which is increasingly being used for advanced transistor-based power electronics and optical computing applications such as optical memory interconnects. Figure 5.19 ⊳ Market share of critical components for data centres and AI supply chains by region/country IEA. CC BY 4.0. No one region dominates all steps in the highly complex supply chain for data centres, but individual steps show high degrees of concentration Note: AI = artificial intelligence; LFP = lithium iron phosphate; EUV lithography = extreme ultraviolet lithography machines.

The United States holds a dominant position in chip design software and chip design, and companies in Japan and Korea dominate markets for critical AI chip components such as high-bandwidth memory. Cooling technologies are likely to become more critical as AI-specialised chips become denser in terms of power and need to dissipate more heat. The supply chain for liquid cooling technologies involves a mix of companies from the United States, China and Europe, as does the supply chain for transformers, while China dominates the global supply chain for the LFP batteries that are increasingly used in data centres because of their power and energy density, long lifecycles and safety and thermal stability (IEA, 2025c). While the United States dominates frontier AI model design and AI-optimised data centre deployment, the full supply chain presents a more complicated picture. As data centres increase in number and as their needs develop, their supply chains for materials and energy-related technologies will increasingly overlap with supply chains critical to the energy sector. For example, the extent to which progress is made in closing the projected demand and supply gap for copper will have a material impact on both data centres and the energy sector, since both are projected to be a key source of copper demand growth. Monitoring how the material footprint of AI and data centres evolves will be critical to anticipating some key energy security risks. Building blocks of the Age of Electricity Electricity accounts for 21% of global total final consumption. Yet, this understates its economic contribution because it provides the key energy input for high value-added sectors such as advanced manufacturing, AI and digital services. Electricity is already the key source of energy for sectors accounting for over 40% of the global economy. By 2035, this rises to around 50% in the STEPS (Figure 5.20). An interlinked set of materials and technologies are critical to control and store electrical energy while at the same time having important applications in many sectors. As the global energy system moves into the Age of Electricity, these materials and technologies come to play an ever more important role. Who controls their supply chains, who manufactures these technologies, and who leads in their innovation will have major implications for both energy and economic security. Copper is a critical example. It is used directly in the energy sector in grids, batteries, solar and wind power, as well as widely in construction, industrial equipment, data centres, phones, computers and semiconductors. Copper can be substituted by aluminium for SPOTLIGHT IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 255 5 some applications, albeit with costs in terms of performance and environmental impact. However, there are many applications where there are currently no substitutes such as in lithium-ion battery anode current collectors, high-performance electronics, high\u0002performance transformers and motors, and subsea power cables. Figure 5.20 ⊳ Electricity as a share of energy consumption and the share of electricity consuming sectors in economic output in the STEPS, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Role of electricity to fuel economic output is two-times higher than its share in total final consumption Similarly, rare earth elements are critical in energy applications such as EV motors, nuclear and wind turbines, aircraft engines and conventional cars. They are also essential in computer hard drives, smartphones, defence technologies and magnetic resonance imaging machines. The effects of shortages are quickly felt. A select number of rare earths were subject to export restrictions in April 2025, and many automakers around the world had to curtail production lines in short order due to supply constraints of rare earth permanent magnets. Lithium-ion batteries are another example. As well as being used in the energy sector, such as in EVs and battery storage, they are critically important for portable electronics, like smartphones, laptops and cameras, and in defence and aerospace applications, such as drones, communication equipment and satellites, as well as some types of medical equipment. There is no substitute for lithium-ion batteries in applications where weight, compactness and reliability are critical. Data centres are increasingly shifting to lithium\u0002ion batteries for uninterrupted power supply units because of the durability and power density that they offer. The critical importance of lithium-ion batteries for modern electronic equipment across sectors can scarcely be overstated. 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 Share of economic output Share of energy consumption IEA. CC BY 4.0. 256 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Semiconductors, transistors and integrated circuits are also relevant in this context. They convert electricity into information, allowing the processing and storage of the data underpinning modern economies and consumer goods. The rise of AI means that data centres and the specialised AI-optimised integrated circuits they house are rising in importance for the energy sector. However, semiconductors are also increasingly being used in the energy sector for power conversion and control, i.e. power electronics. Wide bandgap semiconductors such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride are transforming power electronics by allowing operations at higher voltage, temperature and frequency. Applications of advanced power electronics include EV batteries, solar PV inverters, and advanced transformers for data centres or high-voltage direct current cables. Power electronics and the technologies they work with require critical minerals like gallium, germanium, and neodymium and yttrium. This interrelated set of materials and technologies have innovation and supply chain spillovers. For example, innovation in semiconductor manufacturing has fed into innovation in solar PV manufacturing, while data centres and EV batteries rely on similar power electronics to convert and control electricity with unrivalled precision. In the Age of Electricity, innovation leadership, energy security and economic security will increasingly be linked to these technologies. Investment in energy innovation is often, in this sense, investment in innovation more broadly. 5.2.4 Extreme weather events Extreme weather events are an energy security risk today Natural hazards, which include both geophysical riskssuch as earthquakes and tsunamis, and extreme weather events such as storms, floods, extreme temperatures, droughts and wildfire, pose a perennial threat to energy infrastructure around the globe. They are among the most frequent causes of energy system or supply chain disruptions each year.3 They can damage energy assets, disrupt operations, and hinder the safe and timely transport of key energy commodities around the world. Extreme weather events that caused disruption to energy systems in 2023 are highlighted in this section, alongside new analysis on the impact of extreme heat on the electricity system. Extreme weather events threaten the reliable supply of energy through disruptions and outages. They also increase the cost of energy supply through loss, damage, higher insurance premiums, and the need to build more resilient infrastructure. A new IEA dataset of extreme weather impacts on the energy sector shows that in 2023 alone nearly 300 events of extreme temperatures, storms, floods, droughts and wildfires caused operational disruptions of critical energy infrastructure. The power sector was affected by about 95% of these events, emphasising its vulnerability to extreme weather. 3 In September 2025, the IEA held a High Level Roundtable on Strengthening Energy Infrastructure Resilience: Managing risks from natural hazards and extreme weather to explore this subject further. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 257 5 The IEA dataset shows that extreme temperatures, storms, floods, droughts and wildfires were responsible for reported power cuts to more than 210 million households in 2023 (Figure 5.21). Storms and floods accounted for 46% and 33% of the incidents respectively and together caused reported power cuts to 95 million households. Heatwaves and cold spells accounted for only 8% of the disruption events caused by extreme weather in 2023, but they were responsible for power cuts to more than 75 million households. Electricity networks are especially vulnerable to extreme weather events: damage to substations and electricity grids or the pre-emptive shutting off power lines, e.g. during high winds in wildfire prone areas, together account for around 85% of the incidents in our dataset of 2023 events. Figure 5.21 ⊳ Power outages and operational disruption of energy infrastructure caused by extreme weather events in 2023 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Extreme temperatures, storms, floods, droughts and wildfires were responsible for reported power cuts to more than 210 million households Notes: 2023 provides a snapshot of the impacts of extreme weather events on energy infrastructure. It does not necessarily represent an average weather year, as weather is variable. Outage numbers are likely underestimated due to variability of reporting by region. Events are recorded as a single type, which consolidates compound effects such as storms leading to floods. Sources: IEA analysis based on CRED (2025); GDACS (2025); ReliefWeb (2025). Other parts of energy systems also suffer damage and disruption from extreme weather. In 2023, extreme weather caused disruption to a wide range of energy assets including power plants, fuel supply chains, coal mines and critical mineral mines. Hydropower was disrupted by drought-related water scarcity in Central and South America and by damage caused by floods in Canada and Norway. Storms and wildfires led to damage and safety-related curtailments in wind, solar PV and nuclear plants. Storms and floods caused the closure of Operational disruption of: Power Plant Coal or critical mineral mine Fuel supply chain Power outage due to: Drought Extreme Temperature Storm Flood Wildfire Households affected: less than 10 000; 10 000-150 000; more than 150 000 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 258 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 LNG terminals in Bangladesh and led to LNG shortages for gas power plants. Floods also caused damage and disruption to a coal mine and several critical mineral mines. The scale of the risks to the energy system from extreme weather events depends on exposure and vulnerability, and how critical an asset is within a specific energy system. For example, an outage in a critical transmission line might be more consequential than an outage in a small solar PV plant (Box 5.6). The impact of extreme weather on the energy sector can also extend beyond individual assets and have significant economic repercussions. For example, storms can disrupt oil and gas infrastructure, causing price impacts to ripple across markets. With the rise of electrification, the vulnerability of electricity grids to extreme weather events deserves particular attention. Modern economies are dependent on uninterrupted supplies of electricity, and short outages can have large economic costs. A better understanding of system resilience hinges on improved data collection and reporting on the causes and impacts of outages and disruption. While several advanced economies already require detailed reporting on the causes of outages in power and fuel distribution systems, many countries do not. Investing in the monitoring and reporting of incidents could improve planning by documenting the impact of diverse types of extreme weather on various parts of the energy system, and the frequency with which such impacts occur. A forthcoming IEA special report will further investigate the resilience of energy assets to extreme weather, natural hazards and climate change. A key finding from this emerging work is that solar PV – the world’s fastest growing renewable electricity source – faces one of the highest natural hazard-related risks of destruction due to its unique vulnerability to hailstorms (Box 5.6). Box 5.6 ⊳ Destruction risk of severe hailstorms to solar PV assets In addition to disrupting supply, extreme weather can cause significant damage to energy assets. No global figure is available today for the total damage done to energy infrastructure by extreme weather, but recent insurance claims data suggest that hail damage to solar PV represents the fastest growing, and in some regions the largest, natural catastrophe insurance claim type for power generation assets, averaging more than USD 50 million per claim (GCube Insurance, 2023; Hutchins, 2025). Based on hailstorm patterns, we estimate that almost 5% of installed global solar PV capacity, about 47 GW, risks experiencing at least one severe hailstorm during its lifetime (Figure 5.22). Replacing this amount of PV capacity in case of severe loss would result in costs of about USD 640 million per year. Geographical disparities in hailstorm risks highlight regional hotspots, including the US Great Plains, the southern Himalaya foothills, and areas around the Mediterranean Sea (Prein and Holland, 2018). Assets in the United States and Europe are particularly exposed, with around 13% and 9% respectively of current installed capacity expected to face a severe hailstorm during their operational lifetime, while in China and India the IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 259 5 equivalent figure is around 3%. Measures to reduce the risk of total asset loss include increasing the thickness of front glass material and making use of hail stowage solutions which allow panels to be tilted vertically during storms. We estimate that at least 4% of global solar PV capacity would benefit from using more resilient protective glass, with a cost premium of 5-10% at current prices. Figure 5.22 ⊳ Exposure risks of solar PV assets to severe hailstorms IEA. CC BY 4.0. Severe hailstorms pose significant risks to solar PV assets, which are most acute in the United States Notes: The analysis covers utility-scale solar PV parks. The lifetime of a utility-scale solar PV park is assumed to be 25 years. Severe hailstorms are defined as storms with hailstones larger than 3 cm (ping\u0002pong ball size).

Special focus: impact of extreme heat on energy security Extreme heat events are increasingly posing a threat to the resilience of the energy system, particularly the electricity sector. In extremely hot weather, electricity demand increases as air conditioners work harder to keep buildings cool. In addition, extremely hot weather may also lead to thermal power plants having to reduce their output and to falling solar PV panel efficiency. Moreover, the transfer capacity of transmission lines decreases at high ambient temperatures due to increased resistance, while sagging lines can reduce clearances to below regulated standards, forcing system operators to de-energise lines. Hot temperatures can also lead to the forced shutdown of overheated substations. Such impacts from extreme heat can coincide with other events that reduce the availability of power system infrastructure, such as droughts that reduce hydropower output, long periods of low wind output, or increased wildfire risk. The way that these risks cascade in times of stress is a crucial factor for an assessment of overall system vulnerability.

CC BY 4.0. 260 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 of extreme heat on electricity demand and the derating, or reduction in output, of power plant capacity is the focus in this section. Both the number and duration of heatwaves is growing (Figure 5.23). IEA analysis of data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service indicates that the number of people across the world exposed to high temperatures has almost tripled since the early 1980s (ECMWF, 2025). The distribution is not uniform, with Europe, South America and the Middle East seeing the biggest rise in extreme temperatures). In addition to the magnitude of high temperatures, the duration of high temperatures is increasing. During the first half of the 2020s, areas on every continent except Antarctica experienced the equivalent of an additional month of high temperatures compared with the 1980s. Electricity system peak demand is increasing, driven in large part by an increase in cooling demand (section 5.2.2). System planners factor in electricity demand spikes from peak temperatures based on historical experience, the size of grid infrastructure and an assessment of power system adequacy. However, peak temperatures occasionally exceed the usual maximum of a region, and changes in the climate are driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of these extreme peak temperatures (IPCC, 2021). Figure 5.23 ⊳ Population exposure to days with high temperatures, and change in the highest temperatures by region, 1980-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Changing weather patterns increased the number of people exposed to extreme heat and the changes in extreme temperatures vary by region. Notes: °C = degree Celsius. Population exposure to high temperatures is derived from the population exposed to days where the minimum temperature is above 20 °C and the maximum temperature is above 35 °C. Highest temperatures are the average of those above the 95th percentile for the period 2020-2024 compared to 1980-1984.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 261 5 Increasing uptake and use of air conditioning leads to an increase in peak demand across markets by 2035 in the STEPS of around 330 GW. At the same time, the rise in average temperature and in extreme heat events adds an additional increase of 430 GW to peak demand. More than 50% of this additional increase is associated directly with extreme heat events. There is a small difference between the CPS and the STEPS in terms of the rise in temperature and extreme heat incidents by 2035, but these factors are less important as a differentiator of peak demand growth than the types of air conditioners installed in the two scenarios (Figure 5.24).4 Figure 5.24 ⊳ Aggregated peak electricity demand growth related to cooling and impact of extreme heat by scenario, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Extreme heat increases peak demand by more than 250 GW in both outlooks, equivalent to around half of demand growth from cooling with median temperatures Notes: GW = gigawatt; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. The extreme temperatures impact corresponds to the difference between the median and the top-three peak demand values across 30 years of weather data. The difference in the growth from the increase in median temperature is primarily due to differences in the energy efficiency of cooling, as the median temperature in 2035 is similar in both scenarios. In addition to increasing cooling demand, extreme heat can also affect the reliability of power generation capacity, particularly in thermal power stations. High temperatures can decrease generation capacity through physical decreases in production efficiency, regulatory constraints on the discharge of water used for cooling, or, ultimately, the forced outage of assets. Analysis of empirical data from the European Union and United States indicates that forced outages of thermal power stations are more likely to occur, last longer and leave a 4 In the focus of this analysis to 2035, there is essentially no difference in temperature outcomes between the two scenarios, and therefore differences between the scenarios in terms of the impact of cooling applications on peak demand depends on factors within the energy system, such as efficiency. 300 600 900 Increase in air conditioner use Increase in median temperature Total increase Increase in extreme temperature GW STEPS Growth from: CPS IEA.

Based on our analysis of existing power plant locations, historical and projected temperatures, and existing literature on the effects of high temperatures, we estimate that the global fleet of thermal power stations are likely to face a substantial increase in forced outage incidents due to extreme heat. If covered by higher reserve margins, it would require an additional 115 GW of installed capacity by 2035 in the STEPS, and around 120 GW in the CPS. In a worst case scenario where the derating of power capacity coincides with additional demand due to extreme temperatures, the combined effects amount to a 6% increase in the total capacity needed to meet projected peak demand in both the scenarios (Figure 5.25). This is a substantial amount, equivalent to around one-half to one-third of typical reserve margins, and it highlights the importance of considering extreme temperatures during capacity adequacy planning. However, this analysis excludes two important effects. First, it does not consider the compounding effects of other supply disruptions which may be correlated with extreme temperatures, such as decreased hydropower output and lower wind output. Second, it does not consider the increased risk of reduced transmission line availability due to heat-related derating or equipment failures. Figure 5.25 ⊳ Demand and supply impacts from extreme heat and equivalent share of peak demand by scenario, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 263 5 The impact of extreme heat depends on regional characteristics (Figure 5.26). Some regions are badly affected because they see high variability in extreme temperatures between years, which leads to a large difference between designing for median peak temperatures and planning for extreme peak temperatures; because they have large shares of cooling in peak demand, and therefore a high sensitivity of demand to peak temperatures; or because they have high shares of thermal capacity, which may reduce capacity availability during peak temperatures. In some regions, an increase in peaks of extreme heat does not raise annual peak demand, because peak demand is still driven by winter heating rather than summer cooling. In the regions most affected, in a worst case scenario where these effects coincide, the combined impact of increased peak demand and capacity derating due to extreme heat reaches as much as 10% of peak demand in certain regions by 2035 in the STEPS. Levels of derating are at a similar level in the CPS. This is equivalent to around two-thirds of typical reserve margins in these regions, and underlines the need to consider projected increases in extreme peak temperatures as well as projected increases in median peak temperatures in future capacity adequacy and contingency planning exercises.

Advanced economies, China and the other emerging market and developing economies were each responsible for around one-third of global energy-related emissions in 2024, with international bunkers for aviation and shipping accounting for the rest. Emissions follow divergent trajectories in the STEPS and CPS, but they remain high across the outlook period. Both scenarios result in an increase in global temperatures that is incompatible with internationally agreed climate goals. Global energy-related CO2 emissions peak in the next few years in the STEPS and decline to around 8% below their current level by 2035. Emissions in the advanced economies grouping peaked in 2007 and have since declined by 20% while their economies have grown 30%. The STEPS sees a continuation of this trend, with advanced economy emissions falling by a further 15% from their 2007 peak by 2035. Per capita emissions in China now exceed average per capita emissions in advanced economies as a group. In the STEPS, emissions in China peak before 2030, and then decline by around 15% from their current level by 2035. Emissions in emerging market and developing economies other than China continue to rise through to 2035. This diverse group includes regions with high per capita emissions such as the Middle East and very low per capita emissions such as India and Africa. By 2050, global energy\u0002related CO2 emissions are just under 30 Gt, around 20% below the level of 2024. Figure 5.27 ⊳ Emissions by region and sector in 2024 and by scenario, 2035 and 2050 IEA.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 265 5 Trends in the electricity sector do much to shape the emissions pathway projected in the STEPS. By 2035, global electricity sector emissions are almost 20% lower than in 2024, offsetting continued growth in emissions in the transport and industry sectors. By 2050, electricity sector emissions are almost 50% below their 2024 level. Emissions from industry and transport both peak before 2050, but they are still very close to their current level in that year (Figure 5.27). In contrast, global energy-related emissions in the CPS do not peak before 2030 and are still marginally higher in 2035 than their levels in 2024. They then stay more or less flat through to 2050. Both advanced economies and China see a drop in emissions to 2035 in the CPS, although this is more muted than in the STEPS. However, emissions in emerging market and developing economies other than China increase more strongly between 2024 and 2035 than in the STEPS, pushing up the global total. Figure 5.28 ⊳ Decomposition of the difference in CO2 emissions by driver and scenario, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Increased coal-fired electricity generation drives the main difference in emissions between the scenarios, though end-use sectors in the CPS also see higher emissions Note: Gt CO2 = gigatonnes of carbon dioxide; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; ICE = internal combustion engine. Emissions from coal-fired electricity generation in China are 1.2 Gt higher in the CPS than in the STEPS by 2035, which accounts for two-thirds of the difference in emissions from electricity generation between the two scenarios (Figure 5.28). Coal-fired electricity generation emissions are around 0.3 Gt higher in advanced economies in the CPS. The higher level of emissions from coal-fired power generation in the CPS largely reflects slower deployment of renewables. Other differences between the two scenarios in 2035 stem from: natural gas-fired power generation emissions, around 0.2 Gt higher in the CPS, again as a 18 19 20 21 22 2010 2024 2035 Total final consumption (Gt CO₂) Electric vehicles Electrification in industry Energy efficiency in ICE Efficiency in industry Electrification in buildings CPS STEPS Other 12 13 14 15 16 2010 2024 2035 Electricity generation (Gt CO₂) Coal in China Coal in AE Natural gas in AE Coal in Natural gas in EMDE CPS STEPS other EMDE IEA. CC BY 4.0. 266 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 result of slower uptake of renewables; road transport sector emissions, around 0.3 Gt higher in 2035 in the CPS as a result of slower adoption of EVs and more sluggish improvements in energy efficiency; and industrial production emissions, around 0.6 Gt higher in the CPS because increases in technical efficiency are lower in the CPS than in the STEPS and because lower levels of recycling and material efficiency in the CPS mean more emissions-intensive goods are produced. The emissions pathways in the STEPS and the CPS lead to different temperature outcomes (Figure 5.29). In both scenarios, the long-term global mean temperature rise exceeds 1.5 °C around 2030 and continues to rise to close to 2 °C around 2050. In the CPS, warming increases steadily after this by around 0.2 °C per decade to reach about 2.9 °C by 2100 and still higher temperatures thereafter. In the STEPS, however, the rate of warming slows after 2050, reflecting lower emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) than in the CPS, and reaches around 2.5 °C by 2100. Figure 5.29 ⊳ Temperature rise by scenario in 2050 and 2100 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Median temperature rise in 2100 is 2.9 °C in the CPS and 2.5 °C in the STEPS; in the CPS there is about an 8% chance of a temperature rise above 4 °C in 2100 Notes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Figure shows the long-term global mean temperature rise equal to the mid-point of a 20-year average of the combined land and marine near\u0002surface temperature anomaly relative to 1850-1900, corresponding to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report definition of warming of 0.85 °C between 1995-2014 (IPCC, 2021). Source: IEA analysis based on the outputs of MAGICC 7.5.3. The long-term temperature rise in this edition of the STEPS is around 0.1 °C higher than in the World Energy Outlook-2024, the first year in which the gap between climate outcomes of stated policies and international targets to limit climate change has widened rather than narrowed. This is mainly due to higher levels of emissions of CO2 and methane in the STEPS 2025 than in the STEPS 2024. 1 2 3 4 5 CPS STEPS CPS STEPS 33rd - 67th percentile 5th - 95th percentile Median 2050 °C 2100 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 267 5 Inherent uncertainties in the earth’s response to future GHG emissions and warming mean that significantly higher temperatures cannot be ruled out. There is, for example, roughly a 15% chance of warming above 3 °C by 2100 in the STEPS, and an 8% chance of warming above 4 °C in the CPS. Future warming from current levels is inevitable in any scenario and carries with it risks. Those risks become extreme at the upper end of the levels of warming possible in the STEPS and especially in the CPS. 5.3.1 Air pollution and human health In 2024, air pollution caused more than 16 000 premature deaths per day, nearly five-times those from road accidents. Pollution-related diseases also limit economic productivity: it is estimated that around 1.2 billion workdays are lost every year due to air pollution, and that the total cost of air pollution5 is around USD 6.4 trillion, or 5.6% of global gross domestic product (GDP) (OECD, 2016). In heavily polluted countries, the costs can be much higher; they are estimated to exceed 11% of GDP in parts of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (World Bank, 2025). However, a shift to clean energy can lead to an immediate improvement in air quality. For example, phase outs of coal use for electricity and heating in parts of Canada and Beijing in the 2010s resulted in air quality improving by more than two-thirds within several years (Government of Ontario, 2025; Clean Air Fund, n.d.). Air pollution emissions from energy-related sources are primarily driven by the combustion of fossil fuels and solid bioenergy (Figure 5.30), with significant variations around the world. Today in China and India, coal use in the power sector is the single biggest contributor to emissions, but in the Middle East and Africa, oil use, mostly for electricity and transport, plays the largest role. In African and other emerging market and developing economies, the continued reliance on traditional bioenergy for cooking and heating is a major source of pollution. In the CPS, total global pollution emissions fall by around 10% between 2024-2035. This is mainly from reductions in China and advanced economies, where declining coal use in power generation and turnover of older vehicles in transport lead to sharp declines in air pollution emissions. In other regions, emissions decrease only marginally or even increase due to continued fossil fuel use and slow progress related to clean cooking. Because more and more people live in cities, especially in regions where population growth is highest, the modest drop in emissions is not enough to significantly reduce the share of people breathing heavily polluted air, which remains around 30% globally by 2035, similar to today’s level. The STEPS sees similar trends to the CPS play out among many regions, but with more rapid coal reductions globally and reduced emissions from oil in the Middle East. This leads to about a 15% decline in total emissions to 2035 globally, although the number of people exposed to heavily polluted air remains similar to that in the CPS in that year. 5 Economic costs associated with mortality, poor health outcomes, productivity loss and cognitive impacts.

Source: IEA analysis based on International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). Despite some progress on access to clean cooking, continued high levels of emissions and urbanisation mean that more people are exposed to heavily polluted air by 2035 than today in both scenarios. However, a very different trend emerges in health outcomes connected to household and ambient air pollution in the next decade. The decline in deaths from household air pollution seen in recent years continues, but slows in both scenarios. By 2035 there are around 2 million deaths per year in the STEPS, and 2.4 million in the CPS. The biggest improvements are in China and India, where clean cooking access rates reach 100% and 92% by 2035 respectively in the STEPS. However, premature deaths are set to rise in Africa in both scenarios due to rapid population growth and insufficient progress on clean cooking access (see Chapter 6). The outlook for premature deaths from ambient air pollution is bleak: they increase in all but advanced economies in both scenarios (Figure 5.31). Globally, annual deaths from ambient air pollution rise to 5.3 million in 2035 in the CPS and to 5.2 million in the STEPS. China, India and Africa together account for about 60% of the increase in deaths to 2035 in both scenarios, but there are large rises elsewhere, particularly in per capita terms. 20% 40% 60% 80% 10 20 30 40 2024 CPS STEPS 2024 CPS STEPS 2024 CPS STEPS 2024 CPS STEPS 2024 CPS STEPS 2024 CPS STEPS Mt Other Bioenergy Natural gas Oil Coal Exposure China India Africa Advanced Economies Other EMDE Middle East 2035 2035 2035 2035 2035 2035 (right axis) IEA.

Renewables electricity generation, principally solar PV and wind, and the electrification of end-uses, mainly EVs, are responsible for most of the increase. Energy investment is unevenly distributed: while China, United States and Europe have all ramped up spending, many countries in Africa and Latin America now see lower levels of investment in their energy sector than a decade ago. Even so, these regions encompass over 25% of the global population and are projected to expand their energy demand by nearly 20% by 2035 in the STEPS. The share of global spending on low-emissions technologies has been rising steadily, driven in large part by heightened concerns over energy security since 2022. It is expected to account for two-thirds of total energy investment in 2025. Net importers of fossil fuels are responsible for 70% of the growth in low-emissions technology investment that has taken place over the last five years. 1 2 3 4 5 HAP AAP Advanced economies Other EMDE Middle East Africa India China Million Premature deaths 2024 Change in annual premature deaths 2024-2035 -800 -400 0 400 800 STEPS CPS STEPS CPS Thousand HAP AAP IEA. CC BY 4.0. 270 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Investment in the STEPS stabilises at around USD 3.6 trillion in 2035 and stays relatively flat to 2050 (Figure 5.32). The level of investment in the CPS is nearly 5% lower in 2035 but broadly equal to the STEPS in 2050, yet the structure of investment differs, reflecting the different reading of policy settings used in these scenarios. Investment in the CPS is directed more towards maintaining the current energy system and responding to rising energy demand with conventional sources. Conversely, investment in the STEPS reflects more on new technologies, notably those that provide for electrification of energy end-uses, such as heat pumps and EVs. Accelerating spending on low-emissions technologies in the STEPS means that their share of total investment increases by almost ten percentage points to reach 75% in 2035. Investment in the CPS is higher for natural gas and lower for renewables and the share of investment in low-emissions fuels and technologiesincreases by a small margin to reach about 70% of total energy investment in 2035. Figure 5.32 ⊳ Average annual energy investment by type and scenario, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Share of low-emissions technologies in total global energy investment continues to rise in both scenarios, though marginally less in the CPS Note: MER = market exchange rate; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Supply, power and end-use Between 2025 and 2035, annual investment in the supply of oil and natural gas decreases by about 5% in STEPS as uncertainties around oil demand are partially compensated by new LNG capacity additions, but increases by about 7% in the CPS. Meanwhile, spending on coal declines in both scenarios. By mid-century, investment in the electrification of energy demand, efficiency and renewables for power are about 20% lower in the CPS than in the STEPS, while spending on oil, gas and coal is almost 60% higher (Figure 5.33). 25% 50% 75% 100% 1 2 3 4 2015-19 2020-24 2025-35 STEPS 2025-35 CPS 2035-50 STEPS 2035-50 CPS Electrification Energy efficiency Grids and Storage Nuclear Renewable power Low-emissions fuels Coal Natural gas Oil Share of low-emissions Trillion USD (2024, MER) technologies (right axis) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 271 5 Solar PV accounts for 30% of power sector investment today. China was responsible for 60% of the additional solar PV capacity added in the world in 2024, increasing its overall solar PV capacity by more than 300 GW. In both scenarios, global annual solar PV investment declines in dollar terms to 2035. This reflects continued reductions in capital costs, which mean that adding a given amount of capacity to the system costs less year-by-year. As a result, even with continued new capacity additions, total investment in renewables declines. Investment in electricity grids and battery storage is projected to increase robustly in both scenarios, with combined annual investment of around USD 800 billion by 2035 – more than the amount invested in low-emissions power. Figure 5.33 ⊳ Investment by type and by region/country in the CPS relative to the STEPS, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Investment in solar PV and wind is around USD 80 billion lower in the CPS than in the STEPS, while investment in fossil fuels is nearly USD 150 billion higher Note: MER = market exchange rate; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Investment in renewables in the CPS in 2035, at just over USD 500 billion, is below the level in the STEPS at USD 600 billion. Spending on nuclear increases in both scenarios as several countries take final investment decisions on large new reactors, pushing the current investment level up 40% to over USD 100 billion per year in the STEPS, and by about 30% to over USD 90 billion per year in the CPS. Global investment related to grids is similar in the two scenarios at around USD 730 billion in STEPS and USD 715 billion in CPS in 2035. Higher shares of renewablesin the STEPS mean that investment in grids is slightly higher than in the CPS by 2035, but spending on transmission and distribution is mostly driven by electricity demand growth and line refurbishments, which are similar in both scenarios (see Chapter 3). Battery storage investment is about 15% higher in the STEPS in 2035 than in the CPS. - 100 - 50 0 50 100 China North America Europe India Middle East Other AE Other EMDE Fossil fuel supply Fossil generation Low-emissions fuel supply Renewables and storage Grids Nuclear End-use efficiency End-use electrification Billion USD (2024, MER) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 272 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Overall investment in energy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors stands at around USD 0.8 trillion per year and increases by about 40% in the STEPS to 2035, and reaches USD 1.1 trillion, and by about 15% in the CPS to reach USD 0.9 trillion. This is largely driven by existing energy efficiency policies and standards, including CO2 emissions standards in transport, mandatory building codes and minimum energy performance standards for appliances, air conditioners and industrial electric motors. It is also driven by continued increases in energy demand due to economic growth. Energy efficiency investment is USD 70 billion higher in the STEPS than in the CPS in 2035, reflecting uptake of more efficient appliances in the STEPS and higher efficiency standards in new buildings. Electrification of heat and mobility broadens in both scenarios where current supportive policies or where technologies like heat pumps and EVs are already cost competitive. In the STEPS, this translates into an annual investment increase of about USD 300 billion related to electrification in 2035, double the current level. Total energy costs Investment trends only provide a partial view of the overall costs of energy in each scenario. In practice, investment in energy infrastructure, such as power plants, grids and LNG terminals, are paid back gradually over time by consumers. Likewise, household energy investment, such as EVs, heat pumps and retrofits can either be paid for upfront or financed over several years. This means that capital and financing costs – for both suppliers and consumers – should be seen as an essential element of total energy costs over time. Other components also need to be considered, including operating costs and fossil fuel rents. Operating costs are the sum of spending needed to maintain capital assets and to ensure the continuing production, transport and storage of energy. Fossil fuel rents, an additional cost to energy consumers, are defined as the revenue from fossil fuel sales minus the full costs of production, including financing costs. These rents mostly accrue to governments in the form of taxes, royalties or income from national oil and gas or mining companies. They are distinct from profits made by renewable developers or utilities, which are fully captured in financing costs. Taking these factors into account, operating today’s global energy system costs about USD 7 trillion annually (Figure 5.34). These costs rise in both scenarios as energy services are delivered to a growing global economy and an increasing number of people, yet costs in 2035 are nearly 10% lower in the STEPS than in the CPS. With a higher level of electrification and more investment in capital-intensive technologies, including end-use equipment such as EVs and heat pumps, the STEPS sees slightly higher rates of capital recovery than the CPS. These, however, are offset by higher operating costs in the CPS that reflect higher fossil fuel prices, and by higher fossil fuel rents that reflect both higher fuel prices and higher demand levels for fossil fuels. Fossil fuel rents total USD 1.6 trillion in the STEPS in 2035, and USD 2.3 trillion in the CPS. IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Total energy delivery costs rise in both scenarios, driven by increased capital recovery and financing costs, while operating costs and fossil fuel rents are notably higher in the CPS Note: MER = market exchange rate; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. 5.4.2 Affordability for households Affordable energy is fundamental to social and economic well-being, underpinning everything from household comfort and mobility to industrial productivity and national competitiveness. Total costs of energy to all consumers today are around USD 9 trillion each year, or about 10% of global GDP. Over one-third of it is paid by households to meet energy service demands at home and to provide personal mobility. Household energy bills typically reflect commodity prices and energy delivery costs, but they are also affected by policy and market design: taxes, subsidies and environmental surcharges can substantially influence the final price paid by consumers. Today, oil and electricity dominate household energy bills, accounting for approximately 50% and 30% respectively of the total. Household energy bills in advanced economies averaged around USD 4 700 at purchasing power parity (PPP) 6 per year over the 2019-2024 period. In the STEPS, this falls to around USD 4 100 (PPP) in 2035 (Figure 5.35). This reflects mostly gains in efficiency and increased electrification, for example through improved energy performance in buildings and a higher share of EVs in the passenger vehicle fleet, leading to lower natural gas and oil consumption. While these trends are also visible in emerging market and developing economies, their average household bills increase by nearly 15% as rapid economic growth is translated into higher levels of appliance and vehicle ownership.

CC BY 4.0. 274 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 economies spend on average USD 200 more per year in 2035 than in 2024 on clean energy equipment such as EVs, heat pumps and building retrofits. This projection assumes that a large share of households spread payments for such purchases over several years. Figure 5.35 ⊳ Total average annual household energy bills by energy source and scenario in selected regions, 2019-2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Electricity accounts for a growing share of household energy bills across most regions in both scenarios Notes: PPP = purchasing power parity; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Household energy bills include all relevant taxes, subsidies and environmental surcharges, but do not include the costs of energy equipment. In the CPS, the average annual household energy bill in advanced economies is 6% higher in 2035 than in the STEPS. Slower efficiency gains in buildings and a less rapid uptake of EVs than in the STEPS mean that more energy must be bought to meet the same level of energy service demand. Wholesale oil and natural gas prices are also higher in the CPS, and these prices mostly get passed through to consumer energy bills. The STEPS involves a higher initial outlay than the CPS to improve the efficiency of homes and buying efficient EVs, but this is offset by lower ongoing energy bills over time. In a similar way, the implementation of fossil fuel subsidy reforms and the introduction of CO2 prices in some regions in the STEPS slightly increase consumer energy bills relative to the CPS, but this is more than offset by lower fuel prices and the lower level of energy consumption needed to meet the same energy needs. One of the main differences in household energy bills between the two scenarios concerns the shares accounted for by oil and by electricity. This is particularly evident in markets with differing rates of EV sales. While the upfront costs of EVs remain higher than those of conventional vehicles in most markets, EVs tend to have lower operating costs, leading to lower lifecycle expenditure. Lower EV sales in the CPS are reflected in higher levels of 2 4 6 2019-24 STEPS CPS 2019-24 STEPS CPS 2019-24 STEPS CPS 2019-24 STEPS CPS 2019-24 STEPS CPS 2019-24 STEPS CPS Other Electricity Oil Thousand USD (2024, PPP) North America European Union Japan and Korea China India Africa 2035 2035 2035 2035 2035 2035 IEA.

Figure 5.36 ⊳ Household energy bills for electricity and oil by effect in selected region/country in the CPS relative to the STEPS, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy bills are higher in the CPS than the STEPS as energy prices are generally higher, and a higher level of consumption is needed to provide equivalent energy services Notes: PPP= purchasing power parity; Elec = electricity. Total household energy bill includes oil products, i.e. gasoline, diesel, fuel oil and liquefied petroleum gas, and electricity, as well as natural gas, bioenergy, coal and district heating. In advanced economies, key importing regions in Asia such as Japan and Korea see higher household energy bills in 2035 in the CPS than in the STEPS primarily because oil and natural gas imports cost more in the CPS. European Union retail oil prices are slightly lower in the CPS as the STEPS includes CO2 pricing at the pump as set out in the recently tabled EU Emissions Trading Scheme II. But lower oil consumption per household in the STEPS offsets this, and the average overall household bill is lower than in the CPS. In India and parts of Southeast Asia, retail prices for fossil fuels are lower in the CPS than in the STEPS because the CPS does not include fossil fuel subsidy reform. However, households still face higher energy bills in the CPS because slower improvement in the efficiency of vehicles and household appliances, especially air conditioners, increases overall fuel consumption. In China, the high level of electrification in both scenarios means that households are less affected than their counterparts in many other countries by the increase in global oil prices in the CPS. They are comparatively more exposed to higher electricity prices, but this is moderated by the efficiency of EVs relative to conventional vehicles. -250 0 250 500 -10% 0% 10% 20% Oil Elec Oil Elec Oil Elec Effect due to: Price Energy consumption North America Japan and Korea European Union Advanced economies -60 0 60 120 -10% 0% 10% 20% Oil Elec Oil Elec Oil Elec USD per household (2024, PPP) Difference in total energy bill (right axis) China India Africa Emerging market and developing economies IEA. CC BY 4.0. 276 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 In Africa, average household electricity consumption is higher in the STEPS than in the CPS in part because more people gain access to electricity and clean cooking. However, this increased access is almost completely offset by higher efficiency, and it has no visible impact on average household energy bills. Figure 5.37 ⊳ Household energy bills relative to disposable income and expenditure in advanced economies by income decile and scenario, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Wealthier households see a higher absolute increase in energy bills in the CPS, while lower income households see energy take up a bigger share of their disposable income Note: PPP = purchasing power parity; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Source: IEA analysis based on national survey data, for further details see IEA (2024b). Higher household energy bills in the CPS affect various segments of the population in different ways (Figure 5.37). In 2035 higher income households are more affected in absolute terms, and annual energy bills for the top 10% income increase by more than USD 300 (PPP) in advanced economies: these households tend to consume more energy overall, particularly for transport, and are exposed to higher oil prices in the CPS. However, lower income households are more impacted in relative terms, as they generally already spend a larger share of disposable income on energy than higher income households. Moreover, it is often more difficult for them to invest in energy efficient technologies which reduce energy bills over time, such as heat pumps, EVs, solar panels and building insulation, because of the upfront cost. Although CO2 taxes or prices are one lever among many to push energy investment toward lower emissions outcomes, it is important to design such measures carefully to avoid regressive outcomes, for example by using some or all of the revenues to fund targeted schemes to assist vulnerable households (IEA, 2024b). 6% 12% 18% 20 40 60 80 100 Quintiles of income CPS STEPS Share of disposable income 2 000 4 000 6 000 20 40 60 80 100 Quintiles of income Annual household expenditure USD per household (2024, PPP) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 277 5 Residential electricity prices Electricity accounts for a rising share of household expenses so electricity prices have a significant effect on energy affordability. While electricity prices vary significantly between consumer groups and countries because of differing resources, technologies, regulations, taxes and subsidies – with households often facing higher prices than industrial consumers – their development over time typically reflects the average cost of supplying a unit of electricity. The average cost includes: capital recovery, i.e. annuities paid over the economic lifetime of generation assets to recoup upfront investment; fuel costs; operational and maintenance costs; and emissions-related costs. (Though revenue from carbon taxes or emissions allowance auctions can be directly or indirectly returned to consumers.) It also includes grid costs, which mainly reflect the capital recovery through grid tariffs of investment in grid expansion and replacement, and are often an explicit component of end\u0002user electricity prices. Figure 5.38 ⊳ Household retail electricity prices in selected country/region by scenario, 2024 and 2035, and by contributing factor in 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Residential electricity prices increase in China and decrease in Europe, United States and India, where rising capital intensity is offset by declining fuel costs Notes: MWh = megawatt-hour; MER = market exchange rate; PPP = purchasing power parity; O&M = operation and maintenance; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Other includes taxes, subsidies and other surcharges. Household electricity prices vary significantly across countries and regions. Europe has some of the world’s highest prices, which are projected to decline slightly by 2035 in both scenarios as the share and the fuel price of natural gas-fired generation declines.

CC BY 4.0. 278 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 domestic gas prices trend upward in both scenarios. In the STEPS, household electricity prices decline modestly by 2035 as renewables generation expands, while in the CPS they rise with the growing share of gas-fired generation. In China and India, household electricity prices are significantly lower than in most advanced economies, although the differences are smaller after adjusting for purchasing power parity. These prices, however, are more tightly regulated and do not always fully reflect actual costs. In the STEPS, household electricity prices in China remain relatively stable to 2035, with reductions in fuel costs offsetting increases in capital recovery payments. In the CPS, China experiences a slight rise in household electricity prices because the share of renewables in power generation expands more slowly than in the STEPS, and coal and natural gas prices remain higher. In India, household electricity prices decline in both scenarios: the rising share of renewables in the electricity mix leads to a reduction in fuel costs that outweigh an increase in capital recovery payments (Figure 5.38). 5.4.3 Energy employment Energy employment worldwide expanded by 2.2%, 1.7 million jobs, in 2024. This outpaced economy-wide growth in employment of 1.3%. Employment in the power sector rose by 4%, driven by increasing investment to meet rapidly rising demand for electricity. Much of the job growth was concentrated in construction and manufacturing roles to build new energy infrastructure. Policy shifts, tariff uncertainty and geopolitical risks are now reshaping market expectations, leading many firms to take a cautious approach to hiring and job vacancy rates are already falling across major economies. As a result, the IEA projects job growth in energy to slow to 1% in 2025. Despite near-term headwinds, employment in energy is expected to rise in the medium and long term in both scenarios, driven by robust growth in low-emissions power generation, grids and EVs, though its pace hinges on the availability of skilled labour. The power sector consolidated its position as the largest provider of employment in the global energy industry with 22.6 million jobs as the Age of Electricity gathers pace. The power sector has added jobs at twice the pace of the broader energy industry over the past four years, with solar PV and grids accounting for 40% of all new energy jobs. Looking ahead, low\u0002emissions power generation and grids remain the main employment growth engines in both scenarios, boosted by rising electricity demand, increasing flexibility needs and the expanding integration of AI. Fuel supply-related jobs totalled 20.8 million in 2024. Employment in oil and natural gas staged an uneven recovery, with firms maintaining lean staffing levels. The latest LNG investment cycle has been marked by shortages of welders, pipefitters and electricians, driving up costs(Reuters, 2024). Oil and gas employment expands by nearly 1 million to 2035 in the CPS, but falls by 920 000 in the STEPS, reflecting its faster pace of electrification, the more rapid adoption of renewables and the increased focus on efficiency. The coal sector sees a decline in employment by 2035 in both scenarios, though fewer jobs are lost in the CPS as it projects more use of coal in power generation in emerging market and developing economies such as China and India. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 5 | Implications of CPS and STEPS 279 5 Both scenarios project higher sales of EVs. However, the EV sales share is lower in the CPS, reaching 40% by 2035 versus 50% in the STEPS, rising from current levels of around 20%. As a result, EV-related jobs increase more in the STEPS than in the CPS by 2035, 4.2 million jobs versus 2.6 million jobs. Efficiency gains are higher in the STEPS, reflecting less fossil fuel use in electricity generation, lower system losses, broader adoption of efficient electrification in transport, and more ambitious efficiency policies. This translates into more efficiency-related jobs in the STEPS by 2035, while in the CPS efficiency employment declines, largely due to losses in jobs related to energy efficiency in industry (Figure 5.39). Figure 5.39 ⊳ Global energy-related employment by type and scenario, 2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Employment in the energy sector expands in both scenarios, though the distribution of jobs varies by field and skilled labour shortages shape the pace of the growth Note: ICE = internal combustion engine; HVAC = heating, ventilation and air conditioning; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Energy-related employment is projected to expand in the medium and long term in all IEA scenarios, but the pace of growth depends on the availability of specialised workers. Trained and skilled workers are already in short supply. The energy sector relies more heavily on skilled labour than the wider economy: technical roles, including skilled trades, technicians and plant operators make up over half the energy workforce, more than double their 25% share in the broader economy. Among them, skilled trades – the largest occupational group in the energy sector and the main source of new jobs – are emerging as the most critical 5 10 15 20 25 30 STEPS 2035 CPS 2035 2024 STEPS 2035 CPS 2035 2024 STEPS 2035 CPS 2035 2024 STEPS 2035 CPS 2035 2024 Million workers Coal Oil and gas Low-emissions fuels Critical minerals extraction Operating generation capacity Expanding generation capacity Operating grids and storage Expanding grids and storage ICE vehicles EVs and batteries Industrial efficiency Efficient appliances and lighting Buildings retrofits Heat pumps Other HVAC Supply Power Efficiency Vehicles IEA. CC BY 4.0. 280 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 bottleneck. IEA analysis suggests that six-out-of-ten occupations in the energy sector where shortages are most acute are in skilled trades, e.g. electricians, grid line workers, solar PV installers, pipefitters, welders, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning installers. This raises the importance of the education system in meeting future energy workforce needs in both scenarios. Widespread trade shortages limit the ability of the energy sector to attract workers from other industries, and its specialised requirements make transfers difficult. Addressing the growing labour needs of the energy sector requires co-ordinated policies to expand and modernise vocational education and training (VET) systems. 7 Priorities identified in the recent IEA Future of Energy Skills workshop include expanding certification capacity, modernising training to match emerging technologies, strengthening provider-employer partnerships, improving the perception of vocational degrees, and broadening access to VET programmes, particularly for young people and underrepresented groups. Demographic pressures are exacerbating labour shortages, though in different ways in different regions. In advanced economies, retirements are outpacing new entrants: nearly 30% of union electricians in the United States may retire within a decade; in Japan 36% of workers in the construction industry are aged 55 or over, while only 12% are aged 29 or younger; and Canada expects retirements of 700 000 trade workers by 2028. The challenge is most acute in nuclear and grids, where for every young person joining, there are 1.7 and 1.4 workers, respectively, nearing retirement, well above the economy-wide average. Cultural preferences for university over vocational paths add to the difficulties. In emerging market and developing economies, the challenge stems less from ageing than from skill gaps: in recent years, fewer than 5% of workers aged 19-24 received formal vocational education in India, and tradespeople like electricians and welders remain scarce in South Africa despite high unemployment levels. Underinvestment in vocational education, low certification rates, weak industry-education links and the migration of skilled workers compound these mismatches. Countries like India and Indonesia are seeing a rising share of young people entering energy-relevant degrees, but most regions need stronger action and better co\u0002ordination between policy makers, industry and labour unions. These shortages are already constraining energy operations. The IEA annual Energy Employment Survey received input from over 600 energy firms, trade unions and educators, and half of companies reported critical hiring bottlenecks, a steady increase over previous years. The most common impacts included project delays, longer lead times and cost overruns. Competitiveness also hinges on the ability of the energy sector to adapt to emerging skill needs and shifting roles, with AI and digital capabilities standing out as an especially pressing gap. Investing to develop digital talent and reskill existing workers is critical in both the scenarios. Some early successes have come from industry-university partnerships and company-led training platforms. 7 Vocational education and training systems refer to the structures and institutions that provide the skills, knowledge and practical experience needed for specific occupations.

IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 283 Chapter 6 Achieving access for all A roadmap for universal energy access • Today around 2 billion people lack access to clean cooking and some 730 million remain without electricity – deficits which have far-reaching implications for health, economic opportunity and global development. Since 2010, 1.5 billion people have gained access to clean cooking and 1 billion to electricity, demonstrating that rapid progress is possible. Our new Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS) outlines a country-by-country pathway to universal access that draws on lessons about what has worked best in recent years. • Universal clean cooking access is achieved in the ACCESS around 2040. Over 60% of households gaining access to clean cooking do so through the use of liquefied petroleum gas and a further 18% with the use of electricity. Bioethanol, biogas and solid biomass each account for around 4-6% of households that gain access, while natural gas plays a limited role in dense urban areas with planned infrastructure. The benefits of this transition by 2040 are immense: it cuts premature deaths due to household air pollution by almost two-thirds, significantly reduces the time spent cooking, and delivers net emissions reductions of 1.25 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) annually. • The global electricity access gap closes just after 2035. Over 45% of new connections are from grid extensions; 30% from mini-grids, which are a good match for dense, remote communities; and 25% from stand-alone systems, including solar home systems, which are the best option in areas where grid and mini-grid expansion is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. By 2040, newly connected users add 270 terawatt-hours (TWh) to global electricity demand, contributing up to 45% of the total increase in residential electricity demand in some regions. This is met largely by hydropower, natural gas, and solar photovoltaics (PV), with solar powering most mini\u0002grids and nearly all stand-alone systems. • Closing the access gap worldwide requires USD 4 billion each year for clean cooking from now until 2040, and around USD 23 billion each year for electricity until 2035. While it is encouraging that private sector involvement is expanding, public and concessional financing remains vital to attract capital to underserved segments, especially in riskier markets where public finances are constrained. • Expanding energy access can support productivity improvements in agriculture and local industry, helping to drive broader economic and energy demand growth. However, the speed at which energy demand increases once access has been gained may be constrained by the cost of energy, the affordability of new equipment and appliances, grid reliability, and the availability of maintenance services.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 285 6 6.1 Introduction Even as global energy demand continues to rise, billions of people in around 100 countries remain without access to basic modern energy services. Today nearly 2 billion people lack access to clean cooking and 730 million people lack access to electricity (Figure 6.1). Millions of households, businesses and public institutions such as clinics and schools operate without reliable modern energy. This limits productivity and hinders socioeconomic development. It also perpetuates the use of traditional biomass, with damaging consequences for health and the environment. Figure 6.1 ⊳ Population without energy access, 2000-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Many countries in developing Asia have made rapid progress to extend energy access, but this has not been replicated in some other regions, notably in sub-Saharan Africa Note: 40% of the rest of world population without access to electricity is in Latin America and the Caribbean and over 70% for clean cooking. Rapid progress has been made in recent decades in some regions and countries. Since 2010, 1.5 billion people have gained access to clean cooking and around 1 billion people have gained access to electricity, with notable advances in China, India, Indonesia and Cambodia. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, the number of people without access to modern fuels for cooking has increased over the same period. As major middle income countries approach or achieve universal access, overall global progress has begun to slow, leaving the access gap concentrated in low-income countries, including fragile or conflict-affected states. Lower budgets available for international development assistance compound the challenge of regaining momentum. However, the outlook for extending access to modern energy in these countries has been gradually improving in recent years. Private sector business and finance are participating more actively in the provision of energy access, and innovative technologies and business 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 2000 2010 2024 Sub-Saharan Africa Developing Asia Rest of world Electricity Billion people 2000 2010 2024 Clean cooking IEA. CC BY 4.0. 286 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 models are providing new and more cost-effective ways to broaden access to modern energy services. Growing experience with financing energy access projects is making it easier for companies to secure finance at scale, and a surfeit of solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery production capacity in China is lowering the cost of solar home systems. Energy access has also attracted recent political attention, with clean cooking featuring in the G7 and G20 communiqués, building on the political commitments in the 2024 Clean Cooking Declaration, and with renewed efforts on electricity access being reflected in the Dar Es Salaam Declaration and Mission 300.1 The Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS) charts a path to achieve universal access to clean cooking and electricity based on the best rates of progress achieved historically. Explored in this chapter, the ACCESS prioritises cost-effective and proven measures to improve access, considering all relevant fuels and technologies, and the infrastructure, policies and financing needed to scale them up. It draws on new modelling developed by the IEA based on a country-by-country analysis. It examines distinct pathways for rural and urban areas that take account of the rates of progress achieved in countries sharing similar characteristics in terms of demography, levels of prosperity, resource availability and institutional governance. The modelling assesses the availability and cost of potential solutions and selects the option that is most affordable relative to household incomes and that maximises consumer benefits.2 The pace at which people gain access varies across the IEA scenarios, and the various trajectories are summarised in Box 6.4. The ACCESS pathway and its energy implications are the principal focus of this chapter. The scenario examines the current landscape based on the most recent IEA tracking data, the trajectory to reach universal energy access and the implied investment requirements for access to clean cooking and to electricity. It explores how progress to achieve energy access can lay the foundation for broader energy development, helping economies and societies achieve better prosperity and health. 6.2 Clean cooking 6.2.1 State of play Today, there are still around 2 billion people without access to clean cooking – a quarter of the world’s population.3 Most cook with firewood, charcoal, kerosene and animal dung 1 The IEA Clean Cooking Summit took place in May 2024 in Paris with participants from governments, private sector, development partners, international organisations, philanthropies and civil society. The Declaration pledged signatories to make clean cooking a priority and to enhance efforts to reaching universal access. Adopted by African Heads of State and Government in January 2025, the Dar Es Salaam Declaration outlines measures to provide access to electricity for 300 million Africans by 2030. 2 Full documentation of the modelling approach for the ACCESS is available in the 2025 Global Energy and Climate Model methodology (IEA, 2025a) is published in parallel with the World Energy Outlook 2025. 3 Access to clean cooking means having the use of a stove-fuel combination that achieves at least Tier 4 for fine particulate (PM2.5) emissions and Tier 5 for carbon monoxide emissions in line with the World Health Organization definitions. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 287 6 burned in basic cookstoves or over open fires. This traditional use of biomass leads to poor indoor air quality and has serious health consequences. It also requires time-intensive gathering of fuel and cooking, which restricts the amount of time people have available for more productive activities. Some regions have made significant progress to provide access to clean cooking in recent decades; others, notably sub-Saharan Africa, have seen the number of people without access rise as population growth outstrips gains in access. Since 2010, almost 1.5 billion people in Asia and the Latin America and the Caribbean region (LAC) gained access to modern cooking stoves and fuels, reducing the number of those without access worldwide by a third in the span of 15 years. In 2023, nearly 90% of the population in the LAC region and 77% of the population in developing Asia had access to clean cooking, up from 87% and 52% respectively ten years ago. This progress has been driven by major government initiatives to provide clean cooking. Around three-quarters of those gaining access have done so with the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people without access to clean cooking has risen to around 1 billion today, up from 840 million a decade ago. Only around 23% of people in sub-Saharan Africa had access to clean cooking in 2023. Figure 6.2 ⊳ Clean cooking access by region and fuel IEA. CC BY 4.0. Most people gaining access to clean cooking in the last five years live in developing Asia, and most have gained access by using LPG Notes: LPG = liquefied petroleum gas. Clean bioenergy includes biogas, bioethanol and clean advanced biomass cookstoves (Tier 4-5). Preliminary indicators were used to estimate regional access gains in 2024. Over 70% of the rest of world population without access is in Latin America and the Caribbean. Sources: IEA analysis based on World Health Organization Cooking fuels and technologies database (2025). The pace of progress has slowed in recent years. Worldwide in 2019, around 120 million people gained access to clean cooking, while in 2023 just 100 million people gained access. 50 100 150 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Million people Developing Asia Sub-Saharan Africa Rest of world People gaining access by region 200 400 600 Rest of world Sub-Saharan Africa Developing Asia Million people Electricity LPG Natural gas Clean bioenergy People gaining access by region and fuel, 2019-2023 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 288 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 To some extent this slowdown reflects the major gains made in recent years in countries such as India and Indonesia; those still without access tend to be living in particularly remote areas. The spike in LPG prices following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 slowed progress. Some households reverted, at least temporarily, to cooking with biomass. Countries in developing Asia were particularly affected, given their strong reliance on LPG to expand access over the past decades. Preliminary indicators for 2024 indicate a further slowdown in developing Asia and stable progress in other regions. LPG has fuelled progress to extend clean cooking access in the emerging market and developing economies. More than 75% of those gaining access to clean cooking between 2019 and 2023 did so with the uptake of LPG (Figure 6.2). Others did so by switching to natural gas (17%), and electricity (7%) or biogas. The use of natural gas to extend access was concentrated in countries with urban gas networks; China accounted for around 70% of the total. In many parts of the world, almost everyone living in urban areas now has access to clean cooking options. In developing Asia and the LAC region, for example, urban access rates are around 95%, with remaining gaps concentrated in informal settlements on the urban fringe. As a result, most of the remaining global shortfall is in rural areas, where progress has been steady but uneven: rural access in the emerging market and developing economies rose from 44% in 2019 to 53% in 2023. However, sub-Saharan Africa remains an exception, with substantial clean cooking access deficits persisting in both urban (41% access rate) and rural areas (9% access rate).

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 289 6 One hopeful indicator is that policy frameworks for clean cooking have recently been strengthened in a number of countries. The IEA tracks progress in the development of policy frameworks by looking at a range of policy measures, including national strategies, targets, government incentives, and delivery plans. Since the start of 2024, 64 new clean cooking policy initiatives have been adopted or announced in the emerging market and developing economies, and almost 55% of the population without clean cooking access live in a country that has adopted or announced at least one such initiative (Figure 6.3). Sub-Saharan Africa has seen a notable increase in policy coverage, where over 70% of those without access live in jurisdictions in which new policies have been implemented: 50 new clean cooking policies, including 17 new clean cooking targets, have been put in place since the beginning of 2024. 6.2.2 Outlook Accelerating and maintaining progress in line with the fastest rates of progress witnessed globally would result in near-universal clean cooking access by around 2040, as projected in the ACCESS (Figure 6.4). On average, 130 million people gain access each year in the ACCESS, 1.4-times more than today. The rate of progress in the near term is much quicker, rising to a peak of about 190 million people per year around 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa sees faster acceleration than any other region, with the proportion of the population with access to clean cooking increasing at an average annual rate of 4.7 percentage points – a pace comparable to the best historical rate achieved in countries such as India, Indonesia and Cambodia. Urban areas generally reach full access about five years ahead of national averages, reflecting population density and the scope for making use of existing infrastructure. The timeline to achieve universal energy access to clean cooking differs significantly by region. The LAC region is on track to achieve over 95% clean cooking access by 2031, followed by developing Asia in 2033 and sub-Saharan Africa just before 2040. In the LAC region, the remaining challenge lies in reaching small, often remote or indigenous communities. In developing Asia, major access efforts are needed in countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Mongolia, and a focus on last-mile connections in countries such as Indonesia and India that are approaching universal access. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to be the last region to declare success in universal access, but it sees the sharpest acceleration in the ACCESS, with 80 million people gaining access each year – eight-times the current rate. By 2030, 24 countries are expected to reach near-universal access in the ACCESS, covering around one-quarter of the global population that lack clean cooking solutions today. Most other countries are projected to achieve universal access between 2030 and 2040. While developing Asia and other regions move towards universal access sooner, sub-Saharan Africa lags behind. By 2038, nearly 80% of the remaining population without access to clean cooking is projected to be in Africa. All types of clean cooking solutions contribute to progress. Geographic location, existing infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions all influence which options are likely to be adopted by communities, as do consumer preferences that reflect local cuisine and culture. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 290 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 The IEA assesses the impact of these factors on the availability and affordability of different fuels by region in the modelling for the ACCESS. It takes account of new IEA spatial analysis that evaluates the delivered cost of various fuels at a very granular level to assess which options households are likely to favour, based on the assumption that they will select the most advantageous option within their financial means. The analysis also considers the scalability of supply chains, the scope for improvement in infrastructure and fuel availability over time, and broader considerations of energy security. While recognising that there are wider cultural and other non-financial factors that will also play a part in decisions about which cooking options to adopt, the IEA has not attempted to model these. Figure 6.4 ⊳ Clean cooking access by region in the ACCESS IEA. CC BY 4.0. Developing Asia closes the clean cooking gap by maintaining today’s pace of progress, while sub-Saharan Africa accelerates sharply in the ACCESS Notes: Right chart shows 95 countries with an access gap, but excludes small countries which together represent less than 1% of the total access gap. Over 70% of the rest of world population without access is in Latin America and the Caribbean. Source: IEA analysis based on World Health Organization Cooking fuels and technologies database (2025). Based on this analysis, LPG remains the primary means of expanding clean cooking in the ACCESS, accounting for 63% of new clean cooking access (Figure 6.5). Its primacy reflects its affordability, relatively low infrastructure requirements, ease of transport and compatibility with traditional cooking practices. LPG plays a significant role in both urban and rural settings. Electric cooking provides 18% of new access, a larger share than observed over the past decade, driven by stronger policy support, increased efforts to take advantage of domestic electricity production, and declining technology costs. Electric cooking is a particularly favoured option in urban areas with a reliable electricity supply. Bioethanol and biogas each contribute around 4% of new access, with biogas mainly focused in agricultural areas with ample feedstock.

Natural gas extends access to about 5% of households, primarily in urban areas where infrastructure exists and where supplies of domestically produced gas are readily available. Around two-thirds of the new natural gas connections are in developing Asia, often alongside housing development projects that target informal settlements. Figure 6.5 ⊳ Residential energy demand for cooking and population gaining access by fuel in emerging market and developing economies in the ACCESS, 2024-2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Most households that gain access to clean cooking access do so with the use of LPG (63%) or electricity (18%) Notes: EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; EJ = exajoule; LPG = liquefied petroleum gas. Advanced biomass cookstoves only include clean advanced biomass cookstoves (Tier 4-5). Demand for modern cooking fuelsincreases 1.5-times from today’s level by 2040 in emerging market and developing economies in the ACCESS. While this is a significant shift – roughly equivalent to current total energy use in the United Arab Emirates – it accounts for a relatively small share of global energy demand growth. In sub-Saharan Africa, the transition to modern cooking fuels has a particularly pronounced impact, reshaping regional energy consumption patterns. Global LPG use for residential cooking increasesfrom 2.4 million barrels per day (mb/d) today to around 3.4 mb/d by 2040 in the ACCESS. In the near term, global LPG markets can supply this additional demand, but the increase in LPG demand for cooking may have implications for other users and for how the oil industry markets natural gas liquids. In the longer term, LPG supply is expected to increase through to 2040 as new liquefied natural gas and refining capacity comes online. Households gaining access to clean cooking via electricity increase demand by 120 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2040 (Figure 6.6).

CC BY 4.0. 292 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 electricity demand growth in the ACCESS varies by region, ranging from less than 1% in developing Asia to around 9% in sub-Saharan Africa. Expanding the use of electric cooking depends on improvements in grid reliability and upgrades to household wiring to accommodate the higher power needs of electric appliances. Bioethanol demand reaches 6.5 billion litres annually – around 6% of today’s global fuel ethanol market – driven largely by growth in Africa, particularly East Africa. Biogas and modern solid biomass used for residential cooking also see strong growth, increasing twofold and 15-fold respectively over current levels in the emerging market and developing economies. Figure 6.6 ⊳ Demand for modern energy for clean cooking access by fuel in the ACCESS, 2024-2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Modern energy use for cooking in emerging market and developing economies increases by a factor of 1.5 by 2040 Note: Mt = million tonne; TWh = terawatt-hour; bcm = billion cubic metre; PJ = petajoule; LPG = liquefied petroleum gas. Adequate distribution infrastructure is much more of a challenge in most regions than fuel supply. Countries need to build distribution infrastructure to reach a broad array of consumers, including many in underserved regions and communities. This requires investment in logistics, retail networks, port infrastructure, storage, new manufacturing facilities and supply chain co-ordination. Affordability persists as a significant challenge. Many low-income households cannot afford the upfront or recurring costs of clean cooking options. Bridging the gap requires a mix of measures such as tax and tariff reductions on clean cooking equipment and fuels, targeted subsidies, results-based financing and innovative business models such as pay-as-you-go systems or micro-purchases of fuel. The affordability challenge is particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa, where IEA analysis shows that nearly 600 million people would need to 15 30 45 LPG Mt 50 100 150 Electricity TWh 110 220 330 Biogas Bioethanol PJ Modern solid bioenergy 2 4 6 Natural gas bcm IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 293 6 spend more than 10% of their income to adopt and consistently use clean cooking solutions in the first year. The transition to clean cooking presents other important policy considerations for governments. From an energy security perspective, increased reliance on imported fuels such as LPG, natural gas and ethanol risks increasing exposure to global price volatility and straining hard currency reserves. Governments can mitigate the risks by investing in local storage, diversifying fuel supply sources, and pursuing a broad mix of clean cooking solutions. Many governments are currently looking into reinforcing electric cooking and modern bioenergy options to make use of domestic energy resources such as surplus electricity and agricultural waste, and to create new income streams for farmers and utilities. In addition, the shift away from traditional fuels will affect the livelihoods of workers in the firewood and charcoal supply chains. Supporting a just transition through retraining and integration into clean cooking markets could help to move these workers from the informal economy into formal employment. Their existing distribution networks and logistical experience means that many of them are likely to be good candidates for new roles in fuel delivery, appliance sales and servicing. 6.2.3 Investment Global investment in stoves, end-user equipment and distribution infrastructure averaged USD 4.5 billion per year in the 2019-2023 period (Figure 6.7). LPG dominated at around USD 3 billion per year, largely financed by state-owned enterprises and the private sector, particularly oil and gas distribution companies leveraging on-balance sheet debt. Together electric cooking devices, natural gas, bioethanol, biogas and other cooking solutions attracted an average of nearly USD 1.5 billion in investment over the same period. To reach universal access to clean cooking, total investment of around USD 65 billion is needed, with annual spending peaking in the first half of the 2030s at around USD 5 billion. While this annual average is largely in line with the levels of investment seen today, the ACCESS sees a shift from developing Asia, 80% of investment today, to sub-Saharan Africa with two-thirds of investment in 2036-2040. LPG continues to be the leading option, accounting for 60% of total investment over the period to 2040. The overall amounts remain modest compared with global energy investment, but could bring very high benefits (Box 6.1). Scaling up investment in clean cooking requires action to expand the current range of finance providers and instruments, and to increase access to low cost, flexible debt to support working capital needs, especially for companies that are expanding their customer base but have yet to generate steady revenues from fuel sales or carbon credits. In the ACCESS, the share of debt in total financing for access to clean cooking rises from 35% today to around 60% toward 2040. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 294 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Figure 6.7 ⊳ Investments in clean cooking access by type, 2019-2035, and by source of finance in the ACCESS, 2025-2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Most of the USD 4 billion average annual investment needed for clean cooking comes from private investment, but public support is also crucial Note: MER = market exchange rate. Over 70% of the rest of the world population without access is in Latin America and the Caribbean. Financing requirements for clean cooking differ across regions. In developing Asia, support has largely come from state-owned enterprises orthrough concession-based models. In Latin America and the Caribbean, clean cooking programmes have primarily been administered by government bodies. In Africa, where financing for clean cooking is most needed, private capital is projected to account for 80% of total flows by 2040. Private sector participation is constrained by structural barriers such as macroeconomic and political risk, and by the limited maturity of some markets. This an issue for small and medium enterprises in particular. Larger and more established clean cooking companies are increasingly able to secure financing from domestic and international banks, while major LPG distributors benefit from the ability to raise capital through their parent oil and gas companies, which are either public state-owned enterprises or overseas companies that can access debt in other markets, thereby avoiding the risk premiums typically applied to emerging market and developing economies. However, small and medium enterprises, especially those owned and operated by women, face persistent challenges. Many struggle to access finance or face high capital costs, despite playing a critical role in reaching underserved and remote communities where commercial players are unwilling to invest. As a result, many rely on off-balance sheet financing to fund operations, which inhibits their ability to scale up. 2 4 6 2019- 2023 2025- 2030 2031- 2035 2036- 2040 Sub-Saharan Africa Developing Asia Rest of world Annual average investment Billion USD (2024, MER) 25% 50% 75% 100% Provider Type Public Private Debt Equity Grant Investment share by source of finance IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 295 6 Affordability is another major hurdle. In many cases, clean cookstoves are replacing fuels such as firewood that were either free or low cost. For projects to be viable for price sensitive consumers, stove and fuel costs need to be low, which reduces the likelihood of private investment, unless it can be supplemented by public funding. Viable business models are essential to address these challenges, mitigate repayment risk and unlock access to debt. Clean cooking companies are increasingly adopting innovative approaches such as pay-as-you-go, savings schemes, third-party financing and utility-led models. There is also an increasing focus on empowering women as users, entrepreneurs and employees. If these are seen to be successful, commercial banks are likely to perceive the models as less risky and to be willing to build on their growing experience with similar models for electricity access. This would lead to more favourable lending conditions, i.e. lower interest rates, reduced collateral requirements and longer loan periods, making it easier for companies to secure the financing needed to scale up. Carbon markets can also help close the financing gap, for example by facilitating the use of future carbon credit revenues as collateral to secure loans for their expansion. Carbon credit revenues already account for a significant proportion of the revenue stream for clean cooking companies operating in some regions, notably in Africa, where they represent over 10% of capital flows. While private capital will remain the dominant source of finance, concessional public investment remains vital to extend access to commercially unattractive market segments and to catalyse private sector involvement. There are encouraging efforts to mobilise larger volumes of public finance to support clean cooking in underserved areas such as sub-Saharan Africa. USD 470 million has been disbursed following the USD 2.2 billion worth of new commitments made at the IEA Summit on Clean Cooking in Africa in 2024. Domestic and international public financiers today offer a range of concessional instruments to de-risk investment. Many instruments are increasingly focused on crowding in private sector finance by offering guarantees, political risk insurance and currency hedging. Concessional capital providers can also help address the shortage of equity needed to unlock cost-effective debt at scale for medium-size enterprises with proven models seeking to attract angel investors, venture capital and private equity. In addition, technical assistance grants can help to support early stage business development, flexible grant instruments can help fill equity gaps for smaller firms, and access to flexible debt facilities on concessional financing terms, such as short-term or revolving debt facilities, can help cover fluctuations in cash flows and thus ease constraints on working capital and equity. Box 6.1 ⊳ Benefits of extending access to clean cooking Even when considering the costs of extending access to clean cooking, the benefits remain immense (Figure 6.8). Lack of access to clean cooking harms health, economic development, education and the environment. In the ACCESS, the impact of the transition to clean cooking solutions contributes to reducing premature deaths caused by household air pollution by almost two-thirds globally by 2040. The time saving benefits IEA. CC BY 4.0. 296 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 are also significant. In regions with a clean cooking access gap, women and girls in areas dependent on foraged firewood spend up to five hours a day gathering fuel and cooking, which cut short the time available for education or remunerated activities. In aggregate, the time saved by households switching to clean cooking solutions by 2040 is roughly equivalent to the total number of hours worked each year in Indonesia today. Figure 6.8 ⊳ Impacts of the ACCESS pathway in 2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Benefits of extending clean cooking access are substantial in terms of health, productivity and the environment Notes: Mt CO₂-eq = million tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent. Emissions are compared to a baseline scenario which assumes no further progress in access beyond 2024, with changes driven solely by population growth. Premature deaths refer to deaths caused by household air pollution. Providing access to clean cooking cuts emissions too. Extending access to clean cooking generates approximately 165 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent (Mt CO₂-eq) of additional emissions through increased demand for electricity, LPG and natural gas. However, the transition away from biomass used in traditional cooking methods also reduces or avoids emissions by helping to prevent deforestation and by cutting methane emissions resulting from the incomplete combustion of biomass. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions from cooking and deforestation by around 1.4 gigatonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2-eq) compared to a baseline in which there is no increase in access to clean cooking from the current level. Therefore, in net terms, actions to achieve universal clean cooking access in the ACCESS reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 1.25 Gt CO2-eq annually, equivalent to energy-related CO2 emissions from international aviation and shipping. 1 2 3 4 2024 2040 Annual premature deaths (million) 1 2 3 4 2024 2040 Daily time-savings per household (hours) -1 500 -1 000 - 500 0 500 Total Avoided Net savings Emissions from people gaining access by 2040 (Mt CO₂-eq) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 297 6 6.3 Electricity access 6.3.1 State of play The world has witnessed substantial progress towards universal electricity access in the last two decades. The global access rate increased from 80% in 2010 to over 90% today, which means that 1 billion people have gained access to electricity over the past 15 years. Some countries have seen very significant progress. For example, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh achieved universal access in 2020, 2021 and 2023 respectively, while access rates in Kenya and Rwanda have increased by around 30 and 40 percentage points since 2015 respectively. Yet, successive crises in recent years, including the Covid-19 pandemic, have reversed progress. For the first time in decades, the number of people without access to electricity globally actually increased in 2022. While access levels then picked up, the pace of progress fell short of pre-pandemic trends and the global population without electricity access reduced by only 11 million between 2023 and 2024 (Figure 6.9). In some major economies, the pace of progress is slowing as they approach universal access, leaving only those most difficult to reach without access; in others, the slowdown reflects obstacles such as debt burdens after the Covid-19 pandemic and global energy crisis, and cuts in international aid. Figure 6.9 ⊳ Population without electricity access by region, 2010-2024 and 2018-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Number of people without access to electricity has declined more slowly since the pandemic; in sub-Saharan Africa it has been broadly flat since 2010 Note: Around 40% of the rest of the world population without access is in Latin America and the Caribbean. Today, 730 million people still lack access to electricity. A persistent gap remains in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world’s population that lack access.

CC BY 4.0. 298 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 population has hovered around 600 million since 2010. By contrast, most countries in developing Asia report access rates above 95%, with key exceptions in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Myanmar, and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea). The LAC region has a regional access rate of 98%, though progress lags in Haiti, and connecting remote communities remains a complex task. Grid expansion remains the main way of providing electricity access, but decentralised solutions such as mini-grids and solar home systems play an expanding role, particularly where grids are not available or lack reliability (Figure 6.10). Of the 27 million people that gained access to electricity globally in 2024, the vast majority of new connections were attributable to grid and mini-grid expansions. However, decentralised electricity systems played a particularly significant role in sub-Saharan Africa where over 4 million people – 12% of new connections – gained access to electricity through solar home systems in 2024. Around 4% of households in sub-Saharan Africa now get their electricity from solar home systems that meet the IEA threshold for electricity access (IEA, 2023). 4 Figure 6.10 ⊳ New electricity connections by type, 2019-2024, and population with and without access in 2024 in sub-Saharan Africa IEA.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 299 6 Despite a challenging macroeconomic situation, sales of solar home systems in sub-Saharan Africa rose by 60% between 2019 and 2024, driven by continued market growth in East and West Africa (GOGLA, 2025). In developing Asia, solar home system sales have been more volatile over the same period, but recent data show a nearly 30% increase in 2024. In both regions, adoption has also been fuelled by increased demand for backup supply in areas with frequent grid disruptions. Innovative business models such as pay-as-you-go systems have helped overcome affordability barriers. Electricity access policy frameworks have recently been enhanced in a number of countries with 56 new related policies implemented or announced since the start of 2024 (Figure 6.11). Examples include national electrification strategies, rural electrification or last-mile connection programmes, tax exemptions and consumer affordability support. Around 60% of the global population that lack electricity access live in the countries that have recently strengthened their access policy frameworks. Figure 6.11 ⊳ Recent progress in electricity access policies by type and region IEA. CC BY 4.0. Around 60% of people lacking electricity access live in countries that have seen recent policy progress, with 56 new policies tracked since the start of 2024 Note: Recent progress includes both policies that are in force and announced policies. Most of these enhancements are in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of those without accesslive in countries with new policies, including Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar and Ghana. Policies include new targets laid out in Energy Compacts agreed by African countries at the African Energy Summit in Dar Es Salaam in 2025. In developing Asia, one-third of those without access live in countries with new policies, including Myanmar, Pakistan and the Philippines.

CC BY 4.0. 300 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 6.3.2 Outlook Universal access to electricity could be near by 2035 if global efforts were stepped up to rates equivalent to the best achieved so far. In the ACCESS, an average of 80 million people – more than a twofold increase compared to current rates – gain electricity access each year. Around 19 countries are expected to achieve near-universal access by 2030. Most other countries close their access gaps between 2030 and 2035, while a handful continue to extend last-mile connections through to 2038. Figure 6.12 ⊳ Electricity access by region in the ACCESS IEA. CC BY 4.0. Most countries in developing Asia and the rest of the world close the last-mile gap before 2030 in the ACCESS, while most countries in sub-Saharan Africa need more time Notes: Right chart shows 60 countries with an access gap but excludes small countries which together represent less than 1% of the total access gap. Around 40% of the rest of world population without access is in Latin America and the Caribbean. The pathway to closing the electricity access gap varies significantly among countries. Some are on the final stretch to reach universal access, while others face a steep climb. In developing Asia and the LAC region, most countries have high penetration of electricity access and are now focused on reaching remote rural communities, which have historically been more difficult and expensive to connect. In the ACCESS, progress in these regions continues, but at a slower pace than previously, with around 10 million people gaining access each year. Sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, still has large numbers of people without access in both urban and rural areas (Figure 6.12). This presents an opportunity for rapid gains in the ACCESS on the scale of those seen in India, Indonesia and China at the peak of their electrification drives. In the ACCESS, sub-Saharan Africa sees 70 million people gain access each year – almost a fourfold increase compared to today. 300 600 900 2010 2024 2050 Million people Population without access 3 6 9 2025 2030 2035 2040 Sub-Saharan Africa Developing Asia Rest of world Countries achieving over 95% access Number of countries IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 301 6 Electricity connections derive from three main sources: grid extensions, mini-grids or stand\u0002alone systems. The type of electricity connection households receive in the ACCESS depends on several factors: proximity to existing infrastructure; population density of unelectrified areas; projected demand and ability to pay; and the speed at which new connections can be made. Allocations are informed by a geospatial, least-cost assessment that considers the cost of delivery alongside the projected demand profile, which in turn is closely linked to household income levels. Figure 6.13 ⊳ Global new electricity connections by type and associated generation mix by region in the ACCESS, 2024-2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Almost half of households are connected via grids, while mini-grids connect 30% and stand-alone systems connect 25% Note: SAS = stand-alone systems. Grid expansion remains the dominant approach, accounting for 45% of new connections by 2040, mostly in regions which are relatively densely populated and where unelectrified communities lie close to existing transmission and distribution networks (Figure 6.13). In more remote but sizeable communities, i.e. especially those with schools, clinics, telecom towers, small-scale industry and local mining, mini-grids play a significant role and provide around 30% of new access. Stand-alone systems account for around 25% of new connections in the ACCESS. Stand-alone systems range from small solar home kits to larger set-ups including some with oil-based generators. They are typically deployed in dispersed, low demand areas where neither grid nor mini-grids are economically viable. Many of these systems power just a few basic appliances like lights, fans, radios and mobile phone chargers. Although they are more expensive than grids on a per kilowatt-hour (kWh) basis, and are limited in the services they can provide, stand-alone systems play a crucial role to provide electricity for isolated households.

CC BY 4.0. 302 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 powered systems are becoming increasingly more common and accessible, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, while pay-as-you-go and other innovative business models have improved affordability and increased uptake. Small “pico-solar” devices are also widely purchased and used today: while these may fall short of formal electricity access definition thresholds, they help meet the energy needs of those who cannot afford anything more. When households are first connected, they typically consume only small amounts of electricity for lighting, phone charging and perhaps a fan, radio or television. This reflects affordability constraints and limited appliance ownership. Over time, demand tends to grow as incomes rise and households acquire more appliances, such as a refrigerator, washing machine or electric stove, but this process is gradual. Based on data in several African countries, the IEA has calculated that most newly connected households initially consume one-fifth of the regional average household energy use and even five years on, they consume 20% less than average households in those countries. Despite low per household consumption at the outset, the sheer number of new connections means that demand growth from newly electrified homes is significant. By 2040, the incremental electricity demand arising from households gaining access reaches 270 TWh in the ACCESS, roughly the electricity consumption of Italy today. This increased demand has a marked effect in sub-Saharan Africa, where new access accounts for 45% of additional residential electricity demand from now to 2040, compared with 15% in developing Asia and 5% in other regions (Figure 6.14). Figure 6.14 ⊳ Residential electricity demand from connected households and those gaining access by region in the ACCESS by 2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Extending electricity access contributes little to residential electricity demand growth to 2040 in most regions, but it accounts for over 40% of the total in sub-Saharan Africa Notes: Rest of world = all regions with an access gap other than sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 303 6 New electricity demand is met by the most cost-effective generation sources that can ensure reliable service in the ACCESS. Hydropower and natural gas account for 30% and 25% of global electricity supplied to newly connected households. Solar PV meets a quarter of this demand and powers most off-grid systems. In mini-grids, especially those serving larger rural communities with schools, clinics or small businesses, solar is often combined with battery storage and oil-based backup generators to ensure reliability and continuous supply. The vast majority of stand-alone systems and small access solutions rely on solar and batteries. The total capacity needed to meet the additional demand from new connections through to 2040 is relatively limited. Scaling up electricity access, particularly in areas with limited financial resources, requires efforts to identify and support productive uses of electricity. Local industries, agricultural activities and service providers can act as anchor customers for new access projects helping to stabilise demand and improve project economics. Such anchor consumers are often able to convert reliable electricity into increased productivity and income, improving their ability to pay for electricity services. For developers and financiers, this focus on productive uses is critical, as projects with strong commercial anchors are generally easier to finance and more sustainable. At the same time, expanding electricity access must be accompanied by efforts to improve reliability and affordability. Without dependable electricity, households and businesses cannot make full use of their connections, particularly for income generating activities. IEA analysis of satellite data on nighttime lighting in sub-Saharan Africa reveals that only about half of areas with access to electricity show signs of consistent electricity availability during peak evening hours. A number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa are beginning to strengthen regional power pools and improve co-ordination between rural electrification agencies and national utilities in order to boost reliability. These are important steps to ensure service quality keeps pace with access. Similar actions are underway in other regions too. 6.3.3 Investment The IEA now tracks commitments from public and private financiers related to electricity access. Between 2019 and 2023, an average of USD 3 billion was committed annually to finance electricity access (Figure 6.15). Following a Covid-19 pandemic-related dip in 2020, finance commitments rebounded in 2021; total commitments are now around one-quarter higher than in 2019, at USD 3.4 billion. Finance flows have been heavily concentrated in a handful of countries: in Africa, six countries – South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Senegal, Angola and Nigeria – accounted for almost 50% of tracked financing on the continent over the five-year period. Funding has also been skewed towards urban and peri-urban areas, where higher population density and incomes made it easier to demonstrate bankability for projects. Reaching universal access to electricity worldwide requires around USD 250 billion of investment between 2025 and 2035 to fund capital expenditure, including the cost of installing grid or mini-grid lines, and equipment costs for decentralised solutions. This translates into around USD 23 billion of spending per year between 2025 and 2035, which IEA. CC BY 4.0. 304 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 represents a sizeable portion of expected power sector investment outlays in the coming years and would mean a sevenfold increase in the current level of investment for electricity access. Figure 6.15 ⊳ Investment in electricity access by type, 2019-2035, and by source of finance in the ACCESS, 2025-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Investment in access to electricity increases sevenfold in the period to 2035; of which around 55% is from private sources, with a notable increase in equity capital Notes: MER = market exchange rate; SAS = stand-alone systems. Investment in the 2019-2023 period is based only on countries that have not yet reached universal access in order to have an equal comparison to future investment needs. As such, countries such as India, Indonesia and Bangladesh that reached universal access in recent years are not included. Mobilising more private finance is central to expand electricity access. The private sector accounts for roughly 60% of the investment needed in the ACCESS to reach universal electricity access. The level of private finance involvement varies across solution types: it accounts for 80% of investment in solar home systems, but that figure falls to 50% for grid connection projects, where state-owned utilities are the largest or only players in some markets (Box 6.2). Regulatory hurdles and exposure to financially struggling utilities (Box 6.3) can further hinder private investment in grid connection projects. Box 6.2 ⊳ Innovative financing solutions for off-grid access Private sector investment in off-grid solutions has been increasing in recent years thanks to the development of new financing instruments, particularly off-balance sheet financing for solar home system (SHS) companies (Figure 6.16). Historically, SHS projects were financed through company balance sheets, but this can be restrictive for companies using a pay-as-you-go model because the liability for sold appliances remains on the 5 10 15 20 25 2019-2023 2025-2035 Grid Mini-grid SAS Annual average investment Billion USD (2024, MER) 25% 50% 75% 100% Provider Type Public Private Debt Equity Grant Investment share by source of finance IEA.

Since 2020, large SHS developers began using off-balance sheet transactions underpinned by the securitisation of company receivables – the future payments from customers as they pay back their SHS obligations – to attract a broader range of private investors, including commercial banks. This approach frees up the developer balance sheet while also limiting the risk exposure of investors (IEA, 2025b). In the ACCESS, the use of securitisation increases, including through the use of aggregation platforms that make such transactions viable for smaller developers. Figure 6.16 ⊳ Private financing for decentralised electricity access in Africa by type of solution and investor, 2019-2023 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Stand-alone systems and private sector finance contribute significantly to electricity access projects with large transactions in 2021 and 2022 boosting investment Notes: SHS = solar home systems; impact investors = debt and equity funds with an impact mandate, including private equity and venture capital. Other = crowdfunding, family offices, foundations and angel investors. Data covers financing commitments in high impact countries which together account for about 80% of countries with significant levels of population without access to electricity. Mini-grid companies, which have attracted lower shares of private investment compared to SHS, also expand their use of financing instruments in the ACCESS, including through green debt issuances. Mini-grid development is capital intensive, so access to cheap debt is essential to keep project costs manageable. Developers need longer term loans than are available from most commercial banks, but their transactions are generally too small for them to be able to raise capital in public capital markets. In Nigeria, a combination of concessional capital and local currency guarantees has been used to overcome this difficulty by enabling mini-grid developers to issue green bonds which have been purchased by private investors, including local pension funds. This model could be replicated in markets with clear mini-grid regulatory frameworks and strong financial markets. 25% 50% 75% 100% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Corporate Impact investors Banks Other By provider type 150 300 450 600 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Million USD (current, MER) SHS Mini-grid By solution type IEA. CC BY 4.0. 306 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Future private investment depends on the creation of favourable and stable regulatory frameworks, including provision for investment in grids, clear tariff design and targeted financial incentives. It also depends on an understanding of where private capital can feasibly be deployed, and of how public finance can be strategically disbursed to mobilise this investment. Concessional resources have fallen significantly below the levels envisaged in the ACCESS, but recently received a renewed push to increase them under Mission 300 – an initiative led by the World Bank and the African Development Bank to provide access to 300 million people by 2030 – and this could be invaluable. One of the most significant changes in investment in the ACCESS concerns the structure of financing. As higher risk-taking capital, equity plays a pivotal role in attracting other forms of capital, notably low-cost debt that can help scale up projects to increase access to electricity. Difficulty in obtaining equity has so far held back growth, particularly in the start-up stage for solar home system developers and the growth stage for mini-grid developers. In the ACCESS, new sources of patient equity emerge, including local pension funds and the International Finance Corporation Zafiri Fund, which was announced in 2025 and is expected to scale up in coming years. As a result, the equity share of commitments to last-mile delivery rises in the ACCESS from the 20% level of in the last five years to over a third in the years ahead. Box 6.3 ⊳ Sustaining utility revenues while extending access Extending electricity access requires significant upfront investment. This is rarely covered by the one-off connection fees paid by consumers: utilities typically recover these costs over time through tariffs. However, affordability challenges in many regions make this model difficult to sustain. Low and stagnant demand means utilities have to wait a long time to recoup their investment, which strains revenue and limits the liquidity they need to finance new connections. This problem is particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa. Newly electrified households in the region consume around 50% less electricity than their counterparts in countries like Indonesia and India, and average household electricity consumption in sub-Saharan Africa has declined by about 25% since 2012, while it has increased by a third in other emerging markets and developing economies (Figure 6.17). Expansion costs are also typically higher in sub-Saharan Africa, with dispersed populations and weak transmission networks pushing up the per connection cost of grid investment. To strengthen the economic viability of electrification, utilities are increasingly promoting productive uses of electricity, such as irrigation, agri-processing, textile production and refrigerated supply chains. These uses consume more power than households, generate income that supports repayment, and stimulate broader economic development that, in turn, enables households to afford more energy services. They also support utility finances. In Kenya, for example, small and large industrial customers represent just 5% of connections but account for around 70% of electricity consumption and utility revenues (Kenya Power, 2024). IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 307 6 There is no estimate for how much suppressed demand for productive uses exists in Africa, though it may well be large, given that industrial, services, and agricultural electricity demand per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) in sub-Saharan Africa is around two-times lower than the average of the emerging market and developing economies grouping. Scaling up productive uses of energy could make a major contribution to the expansion of affordable access, while also contributing to economic development, food and water security. Figure 6.17 ⊳ Residential electricity consumption in sub-Saharan Africa and selected countries, 2012-2024, and by solution type, 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Average household electricity consumption in sub-Saharan Africa is low and has decreased by a quarter since 2012 Notes: kWh = kilowatt-hour; SHS = solar home systems. Large SHS have capacity of >100 Watt-peak (Wp). Small SHS have capacity of 10-50 Wp. Sub-Saharan Africa excludes South Africa in this figure. 6.4 Moving beyond access Many emerging market and developing economies stand to benefit immensely from expanded economic activities which are powered by constructive energy use. For example, making energy services available and affordable can help make the industry and agriculture sectors more productive, improve transportation logistics and enable refrigerated supply chains. Such opportunities are often untapped or underdeveloped by households and businesses that have only recently acquired access to energy services. Making energy more affordable and reliable could unlock this latent demand and help to deliver both economic and development goals. This section explores how energy demand has developed alongside energy access in the past and how it might evolve in the trajectory of the ACCESS. 50 100 150 200 2012 2016 2020 2024 Average When first connected kWh per month Residential electricity consumption Indonesia India Sub-Saharan Africa Grid Mini grid Small SHS Large SHS Consumption Average Consumption by solution type in sub-Saharan Africa, 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 308 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Many major emerging market and developing economies have seen economy-wide energy demand per capita rise substantially in the last decade, often during periods in which they made major progress to extend energy access (Figure 6.18). For example, in China and India, residential energy demand rose alongside demand in the industry and services sectors, even as they registered fast reductions in energy intensity, comparable to rates seen in advanced economies. Other regions, however, have seen per capita modern energy use remain stagnant or fall. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, per capita energy use has declined in recent years as efforts to energise economies and improve access to energy have lagged population growth. Figure 6.18 ⊳ Total final modern energy consumption per capita by region, 2000-2024, and change in household consumption and application by region, 2015-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Modern energy consumption per capita has continued to rise in developing Asia over the past decade amid rising economic prosperity, while it has declined in other regions Note: EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; SSA = sub\u0002Saharan Africa; GJ = gigajoule. In the ACCESS, regions where broader increases in energy-based services have stalled shift onto new trajectories that pair growth in energy demand rise with improved access to energy, similar to those witnessed in other emerging market and developing economies. Some regions that are closing their energy access gap, such as India and Indonesia, continue to advance along energy demand trajectories similar to those of advanced economies. In those regions, energy access rises alongside energy demand and GDP per capita (Figure 6.19). Total modern energy demand per capita rises in the ACCESS by around 15% per decade in developing Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, compared with 10% in the average of the overall group of emerging market and developing economies.

Moreover, advances in energy efficiency mean that countries developing today will see lower increases in energy use per unit of GDP growth than economies that developed with less efficient options, while still achieving comparable levels of energy services. Increases in energy efficiency also play a key role to provide affordable options for households just gaining access. Figure 6.19 ⊳ Total final modern energy consumption per capita and GDP per capita for selected countries/regions in the ACCESS, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In developing regions, rising total final modern energy consumption accompanies improvements in energy access and increases in income levels Note: LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; PPP = purchasing power parity. EMDE = emerging market and developing economies Despite recent improvements in energy access, the average household in emerging market and developing economies still consumes far less than in an advanced economy. Households in emerging market and developing economies today consume only 44% of the modern energy used in households in advanced economies (Figure 6.20). Even within emerging market and developing economies, the differences are striking: the average household in sub-Saharan Africa consumes just one-third of modern energy used by the average household in India, and one-tenth of the level in China. Utility data in several African countries show modern energy demand in newly connected households significantly lagging national averages more than ten years after gaining access. This is reflected in the rates of household energy demand growth in the ACCESS. As incomes rise, household energy demand nevertheless increases in the ACCESS, doing so at a pace in line with what has been seen in other emerging market and developing economies, and reflecting expanding energy access, rising appliance ownership and improving living standards.

Among other things, the differences in speed reflect the variations in current levels of energy use and energy access in the regions concerned. Energy demand growth is somewhat faster through to 2035 than in later years, due to the rapid pace of access expansion during that period, but the growth of energy consumption per household with access is relatively constant over time. Figure 6.20 ⊳ Residential modern energy demand growth per household by region in the ACCESS, 1980-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy demand per household is set to continue rising in emerging market and developing economies as countries become wealthier and more people benefit from energy access Note: GJ = gigajoule. Energy access is not enough on its own to improve prosperity. Realising the full transformative potential of energy requires parallel efforts to connect households and companies with the equipment and services needed to turn energy access into improved livelihoods and economic opportunities. Possible initiatives might include: programmes to build refrigerated supply chains that allow farmers to bring more produce to market; to provide low-cost farming and manufacturing equipment to artisanal industries in order to enhance productivity; and to replace oil-based irrigation with efficient electric pumps. Efforts outside the energy sector could include improvements to transport and logistics infrastructure, and efforts to increase access to digital and financial services and tools. The ACCESS presents a pathway to universal access which recognises that progress takes time and that affordability challenges will not be resolved overnight, but still illustrates the transformative potential of universal energy access and productive energy use. It also shows how proven models can be scaled up to address, once and for all, one of the most profound instances of energy insecurity that still persists in the world today. 10 20 30 40 Sub-Saharan Africa India Indonesia China 1980 2000 2020 ACCESS 2035 GJ per household 20 40 60 80 Advanced economies IEA.

Chapter 6 | Achieving access for all 311 6 Box 6.4 ⊳ Energy access in the WEO scenarios As with all the scenarios in the World Energy Outlook, our energy access projections are not forecasts but rather an exploration of a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions. The treatment of energy access progress is closely linked to how the wider energy sector is modelled (see Chapter 2). In the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), only those access policies and programmes already in place are considered. In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), we take into account also announced policies and programmes, although we do not assume that aspirational access targets are met. The Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS), introduced in this chapter, accelerates action to match the best historical progress observed in comparable country contexts. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) maps out a way to achieve the global Sustainable Development Goal 7 target to achieve universal access to electricity and clean cooking by 2030. Figure 6.21 ⊳ Global population lacking access to electricity and clean cooking by scenario, 2010-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy access slows in the CPS and STEPS as some countries reach universal access, leaving the bulk of those without access in countries with weak policy frameworks Note: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; ACCESS = Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. Outcomes related to modern energy access diverge sharply in these scenarios. In the CPS, progress slows as the countries making the strongest efforts achieve universal access, while leaving behind around 700 million people without electricity access and 1.8 billion without clean cooking by 2030, most of whom live in countries that have seen little progress in recent years under current policy settings (Figure 6.21). In the STEPS, the 1 000 2 000 3 000 2010 2024 2050 NZE ACCESS STEPS CPS Electricity Million people 2010 2024 2050 Clean Cooking IEA. CC BY 4.0. 312 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 most recently announced policy measures lead to a modest acceleration of progress, though 1 650 million people remain without access to clean cooking in 2030. Electricity access also improves, but 640 million people without electricity access, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. To achieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 7, the pace would need to rise dramatically in order to give around 150 million people access to electricity and nearly 400 million access to clean cooking each year to 2030 – a rate of progress never previously achieved. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 313 Chapter 7 Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Acting now to limit overshoot • The Paris Agreement set the global goal of limiting warming to well below 2 °C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C. The IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario translates the 1.5 °C goal into a global pathway for the energy sector. The updated NZE Scenario presented here takes account of the most recent data and trends. Each country will tailor its own path to net zero emissions. The updated NZE Scenario is based on four central pillars that are widely applicable: clean energy electrification, energy efficiency, low-emissions fuels and methane abatement. • The installed capacity of renewables increases nearly fourfold from today’s level by 2035 in the NZE Scenario: nuclear and other low-emissions technologies increasingly contribute as electricity demand grows to account for one-third of all energy consumption. Energy efficiency increases by about 4% per year by 2035, double the rate of 2022. Sustainable fuels – including liquid biofuels, biogases, low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels – are widely deployed: their use more than quadruples by 2035 from current levels. Methane emissions are cut by more than 80% by 2035. • Global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were 38 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2024. In the NZE Scenario, emissions fall by nearly 55% by 2035 to around 18 Gt. Yet, the increase in long-term global average temperature exceeds 1.5 °C around 2030 and peaks at around 1.65 °C about 2050. The NZE Scenario achieves the COP28 goals of doubling efficiency and tripling renewables capacity by 2030, and it meets the Paris Agreement goal of holding warming well below 2 °C throughout the 21st Century. • The updated NZE Scenario reflects the fact that exceeding 1.5 °C is now inevitable, and some reliance on technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is unavoidable to return warming to below 1.5 °C. Such technologies are expensive and unproven at scale: immediate action to reduce emissions can limit the scale of the removals needed. In the NZE Scenario, the global average temperature increase falls back below 1.5 °C by 2100. • Energy investment in the NZE Scenario increases to around USD 4.8 trillion per year over the next decade, from USD 3.3 trillion today. As these upfront investments are made, savings from lower fuel prices together with efficiency gains mean that households face costs for energy services comparable to those of today through to 2035, and lower still in the longer term. Fuel importers benefit too as import bills are cut by about two-thirds. Electricity takes on a bigger role to meet energy demand, underlining the significance of electricity security, and the need for secure and diversified supply chains for critical minerals and energy technologies.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 315 7 7.1 Context Background to the NZE Scenario In 2015, the Paris Agreement set the overarching goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius (°C) above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 °C. Subsequent meetings under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of the Parties to the Paris Agreement strengthened the focus on limiting warming to 1.5 °C, building on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5 °C (IPCC, 2018). The outcome of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) 28 in 2023 recognised that limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 °C required countries to reach net zero emissions from the energy sector by mid-century. It identified key milestones for the global energy sector, including tripling the installed capacity of renewables and doubling the rate of increase in energy efficiency improvements by 2030. The International Energy Agency (IEA) was asked by the COP26 Presidency in 2021 to give an indication of what achieving the 1.5 °C goal would mean for the energy sector. Responding to this request, the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) was developed. It represents a global pathway towards the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C. The IEA has always been clear that there are various paths to reach this objective and that each country will have its own route. Since 2021, the IEA has updated its NZE Scenario each year, in line with changes in real world investment, technology developments and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Three inter-related trends have marked the last several years:  Energy sector emissions have continued to set record highs.  Progress in deploying low-emissions technologies and increasing energy efficiency has been very rapid in some cases but is uneven across sectors and countries.  The context in which governments and energy companies are operating remains complex and challenging, marked by features such as increasing geopolitical fragmentation, high government debt burdens, and rising levels of concern about energy security and affordability after the global energy crisis. With these in mind, we have revisited several aspects of the design of the NZE Scenario in this Outlook, while maintaining the end point of net zero energy-related CO2 emissions by 2050, in order to provide an up-to-date analysis of the current state of efforts to meet the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 °C and additional efforts needed to achieve it in the current context. The updated NZE Scenario is presented in this chapter. A limited overshoot pathway to 1.5 °C has slipped out of reach Pathways assessed by the IPCC which limit the increase in the global average temperature to below 1.5 °C by 2100 with no or limited overshoot assumed immediate and rapid emissions IEA. CC BY 4.0. 316 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 reductions from 2015 or 2020. 1 Global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, however, have continued to rise, increasing by 1% in 2024 to an all-time high of 38.2 gigatonnes (Gt). Current emissions levels are therefore moving the world increasingly away from these IPCC pathways (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1 ⊳ Energy-related CO₂ emissions and emissions pathways in scenarios assessed by the IPCC consistent with no or limited overshoot of 1.5 °C, 2010-2025 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy-related emissions are increasingly diverging from pathways assessed by the IPCC which limit warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited overshoot Notes: Mt CO2 = million tonnes of carbon dioxide. 2025e = estimated values for 2025. The ranges for scenarios assessed by the IPCC represents the 25th and 75th percentile. SR1.5 scenarios refers to scenarios assessed in the IPCC Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5 °C (IPCC, 2018). AR6 scenarios refers to C1 scenarios assessed by the IPCC in the Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2022a). Sources: IEA analysis based on IIASA (2022a; 2022b). Because of the delay in reducing emissions, each edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO) has updated the NZE Scenario to factor in higher cumulative emissions and higher peak warming. In the WEO-2024 version of the NZE Scenario, peak warming reached just below 1.6 °C around 2040 before subsequently declining to below 1.5 °C by 2100. Therefore, our NZE Scenario in the WEO-2024 came very close to exceeding the threshold of limited overshoot of about 0.1 °C as defined by the IPCC. 1 Limited overshoot 1.5 °C pathways are defined by the IPCC as those that keep the temperature rise below 1.5 °C with a 33% chance or greater, and which hold the temperature rise in 2100 below 1.5 °C with a 50% chance or greater, and which exceed the 1.5 °C limit by “up to several decades”. This is equivalent to a 50% chance or greater of exceeding 1.5 °C by up to about 0.1 °C (IPCC, 2022). IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 317 7 The level of long-term warming today stands at around 1.4 °C. Given continued high levels of emissions and recent investments in emissions-intensive infrastructure, temporarily exceeding the 1.5 °C threshold is virtually certain. Even pathways that limit this overshoot to less than about 0.1 °C, i.e. IPCC limited overshoot pathways, have slipped out of reach. They would require global CO2 emissions to reach net zero in the mid- to late-2030s. This would mean a fall in emissions of around 3.5 Gt CO2 per year – twice the drop seen in 2020 related to the Covid-19 pandemic – which would have to continue every year for at least the next decade. Deployment of some low-emissions technologies is in line with what is needed, but progress is uneven IEA scenarios are not predictions. Nonetheless, it is useful to compare real world data and trends with scenario projections in order to assess the extent to which they are aligned with what is needed to achieve climate goals. In several areas, clean energy deployment is broadly in line with or even above the levels seen in the NZE Scenario in the WEO-2021: solar photovoltaics (PV) and electric vehicles (EVs) are the best examples (Figure 7.2). In other areas, deployment has been slower: carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, and energy efficiency have all made slower progress than in the WEO-2021 NZE Scenario. Improvements in energy efficiency from 2021 to 2024 averaged 1.6% per year, which is slower than the long-term average during the 2010s, and far below the levels modelled in our original NZE Scenario in 2021. Deployment of clean energy technologies has been highly concentrated geographically. In the 2021-2024 period, advanced economies and China accounted for 80% of all clean energy investment.

CC BY 4.0. 318 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Policies face a complex context Three issues are creating a complex international context for climate policies. First, the global economy is just coming out of the worst bout of inflation since the 1970s, which was exacerbated by the 2022 global energy crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In many countries, consumer prices rose substantially faster in the post-Covid period than before. Inflationary pressures in the energy sector were worsened by high global fossil fuel prices, in particular for natural gas, leading to widespread concerns about energy affordability (Figure 7.3). Figure 7.3 ⊳ Global monetary, fiscal and geopolitical indicators in the pre- and post-Covid periods, 2015-2025 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Affordability, fiscal and geopolitical headwinds have sharpened in the post-Covid period Note: EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. 2025e = estimated values for 2025. Sources: IEA analysis based on data from Oxford Economics (2025); IMF (2025); Caldara and Iacoviello (2021). Second, clean energy technologies are typically more capital intensive than incumbent technologies, and rapid energy transitions require high levels of investment (section 7.4.1). At present, many households, businesses and governments are facing high interest rates and many governments around the world are grappling with challenging fiscal outlooks: in 2025, fiscal deficits in both advanced and emerging market and developing economies are projected to be around 60% larger than on average during the pre-Covid period. Low\u0002emissions energy systems can provide hedges against volatility in fossil fuel markets, but raising the investment needed to achieve energy transitions is made more difficult by tighter financing conditions. Third, governments face a challenging and increasingly fragmented geopolitical environment.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 319 7 is struggling to provide solutions to problems like climate change which require global co\u0002operation. NZE Scenario As countries prepare to consider the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, this updated NZE Scenario pathway aims to provide a pragmatic but ambitious vision of what would it take for the world to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 °C, given recent data on energy, technology, and emissions. As in previous editions, this updated pathway keeps the goal of net zero global CO₂ emissions by 2050. However, it also factors in the reality of recent high emissions, recent emissions\u0002intensive investment, and the slow progress being made in taking forward some options for emissions reductions. Consequently, while it still achieves the COP28 energy goals of doubling the pace of annual efficiency improvements and tripling the installed capacity of renewables, it sees a slightly less rapid transition, with higher emissions in the near term than in previous WEO editions. Warming exceeds 1.5 °C degrees for several decades, and returning to below 1.5 °C by 2100 is only possible with the deployment in the second half of this century of carbon dioxide removal technologies that are currently unproven at large scale. This updated NZE Scenario nevertheless remains a highly ambitious and challenging pathway (Figure 7.4). Critically, it remains below the upper limit enshrined in the Paris Agreement of holding warming to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels throughout the 21st Century and meets internationally agreed energy goals.

CC BY 4.0. 320 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Box 7.1 ⊳ Interpreting the 1.5 °C goal of the Paris Agreement The 1.5 °C goal enshrined in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement forms the basis of the target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 which has been adopted as a domestic policy goal by over 90 countries. However, the wording of the Paris Agreement does not specify several key aspects of the 1.5 °C goal. The most important of these are how the increase in temperatures should be defined and measured; whether it incorporates a temporary exceedance of 1.5 °C; and, if so, how long the period above 1.5 °C may be allowed to last. A scientific and policy consensus on these issues has emerged, shaped to a large extent by subsequent clarifications made by the UNFCCC as well as by assessments of the 1.5 °C target made by the IPCC (UNFCCC, 2022; IPCC, 2021). On the question of how to measure warming, the UNFCCC has specified that warming should be anthropogenic in origin, i.e. for example the effects of volcanic activity should not be taken into account, and that it should be measured “over decades” to smooth out the effects of short-term climate variability, caused for example by the El Nino Southern Oscillation. 2 This decadal average results in a long-term temperature rise which can differ from the measured temperature rise in a given year by up to around 0.2 °C. In 2024, for instance, the best estimates of the long-term temperature rise were between 1.34 °C and 1.41 °C, whereas the measured annual average temperature rise was a record-breaking 1.55 °C (Forster, Smith and Walsh, 2025; WMO, 2025).

Only 4% of scenarios assessed by the IPCC avoid overshoot of the 1.5 °C threshold, and more than half exceed 1.5 °C for at least 40 years Note: Figure shows the C1 and C2 scenarios from IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2022a). 2 The IPCC used the middle year of a 20-year average to define the point in time when a certain average global surface temperature level is reached and used the period 1850-1900 as an approximation of the pre-industrial period specified as a baseline in the Paris Agreement (IPCC, 2021a). 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 0 15 30 45 60 75 Years of overshoot NZE scenario High overshoot Limited overshoot No overshoot Peak temperature rise (°C) IPCC scenarios: 1.5 °C threshold IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 321 7 The IPCC classification of scenarios compatible with 1.5 °C warming also sheds light on the question of overshoot (Figure 7.5). Only 4% of these scenarios avoided overshooting the 1.5 °C threshold; 40% have a peak temperature rise of up to around 1.6 °C (limited overshoot), and the remainder have a peak temperature rise of up to 1.8 °C (high overshoot). Most of the scenarios involve overshoots lasting between 35 and 65 years. The updated NZE Scenario presented in this chapter has a peak temperature rise of around 1.65 °C and overshoots 1.5 °C for around 55 years (section 7.2.2). 7.2 Pathways for emissions and temperature 7.2.1 Emissions In 2024, global energy-related GHG emissions3 reached 42.6 gigatonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2-eq). CO2 emissions accounted for 38.2 Gt of this total – an all-time high. In the NZE Scenario, GHG emissions fall around 50% to 2035, and CO2 emissions by almost 55% to around 18 Gt (Figure 7.6). Emissions from electricity generation, which today make up about 40% of total energy-related CO2 emissions, decline particularly fast: they drop to around one-quarter of today’s levels by 2035. By 2050, remaining energy-related CO2 emissions of around 2.1 Gt are mainly from industry (0.45 Gt), aviation and shipping (0.4 Gt) and road freight (0.32 Gt), and are balanced by removals of the same magnitude, without any reliance on removals from land-use measures. The NZE Scenario also sees rapid reductions in GHG emissions and climate forcers other than CO2, including short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), which exert a large warming effect but have short atmospheric lifetimes. Cutting emissions from SLCFs has a key role to limit global warming in the decades around mid-century (section 7.2.3). Important energy-related SLCFs include methane and black carbon4, emissions of which drop by more than 80% in 2035 from today’s level (section 7.3.4). As many SLCFs are air pollutants, curbing their emissions also has significant benefits for public health. Reducing or limiting the growth in non-energy-related GHG emisions also plays a valuable part in minimising the rise in global temperatures. For example, in the NZE Scenario CO2 emissions associated with deforestation fall almost 50% by 2050, with the result that net CO2 emissions from land use and forestry, i.e. including the effects of afforestation, fall from over 4 Gt today to net zero in the mid-2040s. In a similar vein, efficiency gains in crop management which reduce reliance on fertiliser mean that nitrous dioxide emissions from agriculture in 2050 are close to current levels, despite a 75% increase in crop production for food and 3 Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from fossil fuel combustion, flaring and fugitive CO2 and industrial processes. 4 The warming effects of black carbon remain highly uncertain due to its complex interactions with clouds and surface albedo, especially in snow- and ice-covered regions (IPCC, 2021b). IEA. CC BY 4.0. 322 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 bioenergy by that time. Despite these measures, it remains hard to eliminate all non-energy\u0002related GHG emissions by 2050, particularly those from agriculture and from F-gases used as refrigerants and in industrial processes. Emissions of non-energy-related GHGs fall by 45% between 2024 and 2050.

Implications for emissions and atmospheric carbon dioxide removals after 2050 Bringing the global increase in average temperature back down to below 1.5 °C requires scaling up CO2 removal from the atmosphere. The NZE Scenario assumes that this occurs predominantly through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture and storage (DACS), although other removal strategies exist outside the energy sector (Box 7.2). Annual CO2 removal using these technologies in the NZE Scenario reaches 2.1 Gt CO2 in 2050 and 3.8 Gt CO2 by 2100 (Figure 7.8). This would mean removing the current annual energy-related CO2 emissions of India and Indonesia combined from the atmosphere by 2100. CO2 removal on this scale has obvious economic and resource implications. The earth system response to net zero emissions and to net removals from the atmosphere is also highly uncertain. 15 30 45 60 2010 2030 2050 Energy-related and other GHG emissions Gt CO₂-eq Energy-related GHGs Other GHGs -5 0 5 10 15 2010 2030 2050 CO2 emissions by sector Industry Electricity Transport Other Buildings IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 323 7 Box 7.2 ⊳ The critical importance of cutting gross emissions Removing CO₂ from the atmosphere is very challenging. The scale of CO₂ removals needed to return warming to below 1.5 °C depends not just on the degree of temperature overshoot but also on the size of residual gross emissions. Some sectors, such as aviation, may struggle to reach net zero emissions if low-emissions technologies such as sustainable aviation fuels cannot be scaled up sufficiently (section 7.3.3). If this is the case, some atmospheric removals will be needed to achieve net zero emissions. In the NZE Scenario, gross annual emissions are reduced to around 2.1 Gt by 2050 and decline further to just under 1 Gt by 2100. Comparable high overshoot 1.5 °C scenarios assessed by the IPCC assume much lower potential to reduce gross emissions. In these scenarios, even after net zero is reached, gross emissions average nearly 7 Gt per year out to 2100 (Figure 7.7). This is more than the total emissions today from hard-to-abate sectors such as international transport, iron and steel and cement. Figure 7.7 ⊳ Average annual emissions and removals from applications of BECCS and DACS in high overshoot 1.5 °C scenarios assessed by the IPCC IEA. CC BY 4.0. In scenarios assessed by the IPCC, continued high levels of gross emissions lead to a large reliance on removal technologies which are unproven at scale today Note: Annual average is measured from the year energy sector emissions reach net zero to 2100. Source: IEA analysis based on data from IIASA (2022). Limiting reliance on removal technologies, which are unproven at scale today, means acting now to reduce peak warming as much as possible, for example by cutting emissions of short-lived-climate forcers and maximising the deployment of clean energy technologies across the entire energy system. Achieving this in sectors such as energy\u0002intensive industries and long-distance transport will require innovation. - 15 - 10 - 5 0 5 10 Gross emissions Gross removals Net Emissions NZE Gt CO₂ IEA.

Around 3.8 Gt per year of CO₂ removals via BECCS and DACS would be needed to bring the temperature rise to below 1.5 °C by 2100 Note: Gt CO2 = gigatonne of carbon dioxide; BECCS = bioenergy equipped with CCUS; DACS = direct air capture and storage. By 2050, around 1.1 Gt CO2 is removed from the atmosphere through BECCS in the NZE Scenario, and this rises to around 2 Gt by 2100. The extent to which BECCS can be increased is constrained by limits on sustainable bioenergy supply, as well as by the economic and logistical challenges of deploying infrastructure to connect widely dispersed bioenergy facilities with large-scale CO2 storage sites. Removing 2 Gt CO2 per year would require gathering, processing, combusting, capturing, transporting and storing the emissions from bioenergy produced on roughly 150 million hectares (Mha) of land, around 15% more than the total land area of Peru (Figure 7.9). While the deployment of DACS is not restricted by the availability of feedstock or suitable sites, the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere means that DACS is currently much more energy-intensive and costly than BECCS. By 2050 around 1 Gt of CO2 is removed by DACS in the NZE Scenario, and this grows to about 1.8 Gt by 2100 to make up the remaining removals. This level of DACS would require just over 13 exajoules (EJ) per year by 2100, roughly equivalent to the energy requirements for buildings in the European Union today. If the energy required for the deployment of DACS were provided by solar PV, this would require around 3.3 Mha of land - slightly more than the land area of Belgium. While this is orders of magnitude lower than the land and water footprints typically associated with bioenergy production, it would put further strains on an already resource-constrained energy system. -10 0 10 20 30 40 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2070 2080 2090 2100 Gt CO₂ Net emissions Gross emissions BECCS and DACS IEA.

BECCS and DACS required in the NZE Scenario would require enormous amounts of energy, money and land Note: EJ = exajoule; Mha = million hectares; BECCS = bioenergy equipped with carbon capture and storage; DACS = direct air capture and storage; EU = European Union. Today, total CO2 removal capacity stands at around 1 Mt CO2 per year, mostly in the form of BECCS. While recent company announcements suggest that BECCS and DACS capacity may increase more than 80-fold by 2035 from current levels, this is still far below the annual removal of 660 Mt CO2 needed by 2035 in the NZE Scenario. Reaching the levels needed would take huge, concerted efforts to support innovation, increase efficiencies, and promote durable, measurable and verifiable removals. It would also require a huge amount of money: removing 2 Gt with BECCS and 1.8 Gt with DACS each year by the end of the century would cost just over USD 850 billion per year, or around one-third more than was spent on global renewables investment in 2024. Organising this scale of resource mobilisation would be a major challenge requiring close international co-operation. The difficulties involved in large\u0002scale removal of CO2 from the atmosphere very strongly underline the case for ensuring that everything possible is done to minimise the need for it. 7.2.2 Climate outcomes The long-term global average rise in temperatures above pre-industrial levels was around 1.4 °C in 2024 (Forster, Smith and Walsh, 2025; WMO, 2025). In the NZE Scenario, this increases to above 1.5 °C around 2030 and peaks at around 1.65 °C in about 2050 (Figure 7.10). It then gradually declines by 0.04 °C per decade to below 1.5 °C in 2100. The reduction in warming after 2050 reflects in part natural processes whereby land and oceans absorb atmospheric carbon and reduce its warming effect, the steep drop in emissions of 5 10 15 20 Energy use (EJ) 0.3 0.5 0.8 1.0 BECCS DACS Cost (Trillion USD) 40 80 120 160 2024 EU energy consumption for building 2024 Global renewables investment Land area of Peru Land (Mha) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 326 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 SLCFs such as methane in the preceding decades, and a small additional uptake of CO2 from afforestation. However, these factors alone would not be sufficient to reduce the temperature rise below 1.5 °C: this outcome is only achieved through the large-scale deployment of CO2 removal technologies. Figure 7.10 ⊳ Temperature rise in the NZE Scenario, 2000-2100 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Temperature rise peaks close to 1.65 °C around 2050 and falls back below 1.5 °C by 2100; however, significantly higher levels of warming cannot be ruled out Note: Figure shows the long-term global mean temperature rise equal to the mid-point of a 20-year average of the combined land and marine near-surface temperature anomaly relative to 1850-1900, corresponding to IPCC Sixth Assessment Report definition of warming of 0.85 °C between 1995-2014. Sources: IEA analysis based on the outputs of MAGICC 7.5.3, IPCC (2021). In the NZE Scenario, global warming rises above 1.6 °C for almost 30 years and above 1.5 °C for around 55 years. This prolonged temperature overshoot presents significant consequences for vulnerable populations, ecosystems and the stability of critical climate tipping elements. This is in part because overshooting 1.5 °C intensifies extreme weather events, e.g. heatwaves, droughts and floods, which disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and regions, especially in low-income countries with limited adaptive capacity. Weather extremes can also adversely affect the functioning of energy systems with associated costs arising from climate impacts and the necessity to build more climate resilient infrastructure (see Chapter 5). The IPCC Reasons for Concern framework notes that increased warming brings extra risks for unique and threatened systems, such as glaciers and biodiversity hotspots, and is likely to mean more frequent and damaging extreme weather events and raises the risk of large-scale singular events, such as abrupt shifts in ocean circulations. The level of additional impact and risk due to climate change grows markedly as warming progresses beyond 1.5 °C, with 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 2000 2020 2040 2060 2080 2100 33rd - 67th percentile 5th - 95th percentile NZE °C IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 327 7 multiple risks becoming high or very high between 1.5 °C and 2 °C (IPCC, 2022b). Threats to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity are expected to persist for decades beyond the period of peak warming. In over one-quarter of surveyed global regions, the likelihood that animal and plant species can fully recover to pre-overshoot conditions is either highly uncertain or effectively negligible (Meyer et al., 2022). Some effects of global warming are also known to be irreversible as temperatures fall back down. For example, sea levels will continue to rise for centuries to millennia even if long-term temperatures decline, and regional changes in climate are likely to persist after global mean temperatures decline (Schleussner, 2024). Inherent uncertainties in how the earth responds to future warming, GHG emissions, and the engineered removal of CO₂ from the atmosphere mean that significantly higher levels of warming cannot be ruled out. We calculate that, even if the NZE Scenario were to be achieved in full, there would still be about a 20% chance of future warming exceeding 2 °C, and about a 45% chance of not reducing warming below 1.5 °C by 2100. In addition to exacerbating extreme weather and other physical hazards associated with climate change, higher levels of warming might lead to various tipping points being reached, e.g. melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet or the rapid dieback of the Amazon rainforest, which would not reverse even if warming were subsequently brought down below 1.5 °C. Reaching these kinds of tipping points would have consequences for the long-term habitability of the planet (Wunderling et al., 2022). The risks associated with rising temperatures are much more acute in the STEPS and CPS. How the NZE Scenario limits peak warming and then cools the planet If economy-wide GHG emissions were to continue at 2024 levels then the temperature rise – which today stands at around 1.4 °C – would reach just under 2 °C by 2050. In the NZE Scenario, however, the temperature rise reaches a peak of around 1.65 °C in 2050 and then starts to decline. Around two-thirds of the avoided warming in the NZE Scenario results from rapidly reducing economy-wide CO2 emissions to net zero around 2050, with the almost all the remainder of avoided warming due to declining methane and N2O emissions. Other effects in the NZE Scenario, including cuts to emissions of aerosols and fluorinated gases, lead in aggregate to a small warming effect, raising temperatures in 2050 by around 0.1 °C above what their level would have been otherwise (Figure 7.11). After 2050 the temperature rise reduces steadily to around 1.45 °C in 2100 in the NZE Scenario. About 30% of this cooling happens because of removals of CO2 from the atmosphere, mainly via BECCS and DACS, and a further 30% of cooling stems from reductions in methane and N2O emissions – both as a lagged response to reductions that happen prior to 2050 and because of continuing reductions in emissions of these GHG after 2050. A final 40% of cooling is associated with natural processes that reduce global SPOTLIGHT IEA. CC BY 4.0. 328 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 surface temperatures in the decades after net zero CO2 emissions are achieved. There is also a small temperature rebound from other effects. Figure 7.11 ⊳ Global warming avoided in the NZE Scenario relative to constant emissions in 2050 and cooling 2050 to 2100 by lever IEA. CC BY 4.0. Reducing CO2 emissions to net zero contributes most to warming avoided in the NZE Scenario in 2050; after 2050 cooling from natural processes plays a key role Notes: Constant emissions = all GHG emissions held at 2024 levels between 2024-2050; Other GHG reductions = methane and N2O reductions; CDR = carbon dioxide removals; Other = reduced emissions of aerosols, aerosol precursors and Montreal gases (including fluorinated gases) and the lagged temperature response to prior emissions due to physio-chemical interactions between GHGs in the atmosphere. Analysis based on global anthropogenic emissions, not only energy-related emissions. Source: IEA analysis based on Climate Resource and MAGICC 7.5.3. Predicting the level of warming associated with future GHG emissions is inherently uncertain, meaning that significantly higher warming than happens in the NZE Scenario cannot be ruled out. Much of the uncertainty stems from physical and biogeochemical feedback effects as the earth warms such as changes to cloud cover and the rate at which the land and oceans draw down atmospheric CO2. Nonethelessthere is a well-established near linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and the short-term temperature rise. However, there is currently a weaker scientific understanding of the extent to which removing CO2 from the atmosphere will cool the climate (Zickfeld, 2021). Much of this is due to uncertainty in the “Zero Emissions Commitment” (ZEC) – the change in global average surface temperatures due to natural processes in the decades after reaching net zero CO2 emissions. For example, the MAGICC climate model used by the IEA for this assessment estimates a ZEC corresponding to around 0.1 °C of cooling in the 50 years 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2050 2050 2100 Surface temperature (°C) CO₂ reductions to net zero Other GHG reductions Natural processes CDR Other Constant emissions NZE 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 329 7 after net zero is reached, but other climate models find between around 0.4 °C of cooling to 0.3 °C of warming under similar conditions (Palazzo Corner S, 2023). Achieving the climate outcomes of the NZE Scenario if natural processes fail to lower surface temperatures after 2050 would present major implications for the energy sector. Emissions of methane and N2O in aggregate drop by around 20% between 2050 – 2100; speeding up this rate of reduction by 50%, which would be extremely difficult given the scarcity of options to further cut emissions, could reduce temperatures in 2100 by around 0.02 °C – around one-quarter of what would be needed to compensate for the absence of cooling from natural processes. The remaining cooling would need to be achieved via CO2 removals from the atmosphere, which would need to increase to around 8 Gt per year by 2100 – around twice the level in the NZE Scenario. It is possible that some of this could happen because of increased afforestation, but it is likely that technological removals via BECCS and DACS would need to reach much higher levels than in the NZE Scenario, with stark consequences for land use, energy requirements and cost. 7.3 Energy pathways in the NZE Scenario The NZE Scenario illustrates a possible global path to the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Each country will have its own pathway, depending on their circumstances. The energy transition set out in the NZE Scenario has four main pillars: deployment of low-emissions sources of electricity and electrification to reduce emissions in end-uses; improvements in energy efficiency; use of low-emissions fuels such as hydrogen, biofuels, and CCUS; and reductions in methane emissions. These strategies rapidly reduce emissions and drive a demand-led transition away from fossil fuels in this scenario. 7.3.1 Clean electrification Today, the power sector accounts for about 40% of global energy-related emissions. Shifting electricity generation to low-emissions sources and increasing the deployment of low\u0002emissions electricity in existing and new end-uses are central to the NZE Scenario: these strategies give rise to around two-thirds of the emissions reductions to 2035 (Figure 7.12). In the NZE Scenario, low-emissions sources provide nearly all electricity generation by 2040, while electricity increases its share in total final consumption to around 40% by 2040 and 55% by 2050. The expanding role of electricity in total final consumption and the increase in electricity supply from variable renewable sources underline the importance of electricity security in the NZE Scenario. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 330 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Figure 7.12 ⊳ Low-emissions share of generation relative to electricity in final consumption and levers employed to cut emissions in the NZE Scenario, 2024-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Clean electrification, which includes shifting generation to low-emissions sources and maximising electricity end-use, provides around two-thirds of emissions reductions achieved by 2035 Note: Gt CO2 = gigatonnes of carbon dioxide; CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage; DACS = direct air capture and storage. Generating electricity with low-emissions sources Low-emissions sources of electricity – renewables, nuclear, fossil fuels with CCUS, hydrogen and ammonia – accounted for just over 40% of global electricity generation in 2024, up from around 30% a decade ago. Renewables were responsible for 32% of power generation worldwide, and nuclear for around 9%: there was also a very small contribution of less than 0.003% from fossil fuels equipped with CCUS. Global installed capacity of renewables triples to 2030 from a 2022 baseline in the NZE Scenario, building on the strong momentum already seen in the power sector, and meeting the goal set at COP28 in 2023 (Figure 7.13). As a result, renewables expand from around one-third of total generation today to around three-quarters by 2035. Achieving this while maintaining electricity security means ensuring that investment in electricity system flexibility keeps pace. Having surged by over 80% in 2024, the installed capacity of stationary batteries increases 17-fold to 2035, average of 30% per year, reaching almost 2 900 gigawatts (GW) in capacity terms and more than 8 400 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in energy terms. In the NZE Scenario, investment surges in grid infrastructure, and around 30 million kilometres (km) of new transmission and distribution lines are added by 2035. As variable renewables such as solar PV and wind account for a rising share of generation, dispatchable capacity plays a critical role to ensure electricity security.

By the 2030s, the nuclear industry delivers annual additions of around 40 GW per year (Box 7.3). Hydropower capacity also expands strongly, with generation increasing more than 1.5-times by 2050. Unabated fossil fuel plants are operated increasingly for flexibility and capacity adequacy, and consequently their installed capacity falls more slowly than their output across the Outlook period. Fossil fuel plants equipped with CCUS and plants fired with hydrogen or ammonia are also deployed, providing additional low-emissions dispatchable capacity.

The goal to triple renewables capacity set at COP28 refers to a baseline of installed capacity as of 2022. Box 7.3 ⊳ What would it take to meet the pledge of tripling installed nuclear capacity? At the COP28 in December 2023, more than 20 countries, representing 70% of current installed nuclear capacity, pledged to triple global nuclear power capacity by 2050. Six additional countries signed the pledge at the COP29 in 2024. If fully realised, this commitment would increase global nuclear capacity from 413 GW in 2020 to 1 240 GW by mid-century, which would exceed the level in the NZE Scenario by 160 GW. 30 60 90 2000 2024 2050 Electricity generation (TWh) Unabated coal Unabated natural gas Other Nuclear Hydro Solar PV Wind Other renewables Hydrogen, ammonia and fossil fuels with CCUS 6 12 2030 2024 Renewables (Thousand GW) 600 1 200 2050 2024 Nuclear (GW) 1 700 3 400 2035 2024 Storage (GW) 60 120 2035 2024 Grids (Million km) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 332 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Reaching the tripling target by 2050 would require immediate efforts to scale up the nuclear industry in the 2020s to accelerate deployment in the 2030s and beyond, with annual deployment rates rising quickly in the 2030s to around 40 GW and being maintained throughout that decade and the 2040s. According to our analysis, this would lead to levels of global nuclear capacity additions never achieved before (Figure 7.14). This expansion would support a wide range of applications. Beyond its traditional role in the power sector, nuclear energy could contribute to water desalination and to low\u0002emissions hydrogen production, for example. In the NZE Scenario, the pace of nuclear capacity additions is expected to slow after the mid-2030s, in line with other low\u0002emissions technologies, as most electricity systems become largely decarbonised by then: as a result, capacity rises 2.5-times from the current level rather than tripling. Figure 7.14 ⊳ Global nuclear installed capacity and capacity additions to reach the tripling target by 2050 relative to the NZE Scenario IEA. CC BY 4.0. Achieving the tripling of global nuclear capacity requires capacity additions of some 40 GW annually through the 2030s and 2040s, primarily driven by advanced economies Note: Other EMDE = emerging market and developing economies other than China; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Achieving this tripling of nuclear capacity would require a significant increase in investment. Annual investment spending would need to rise from over USD 70 billion today to a peak of about USD 210 billion around 2035 before plateauing at around USD 160 billion through the 2040s. Investment would need to be on average 50% higher throughout the 2040s than in the NZE Scenario, resulting in an additional USD 900 billion of spending by 2050. This scaling up would be heavily dependent on robust supply chains, skilled labour and long-term policy support. 300 600 900 1 200 1 500 1990200020102020203020402050 Advanced economies China Other EMDE NZE Installed capacity GW 10 20 30 40 50 1970s1980s1990s2000s2010s2020s2030s2040s Average annual capacity additions IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 333 7 The United States could play a central role in this global effort. An Executive Order issued in May 2025 to reform the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission aims to revitalise the domestic nuclear industry and sets a goal of adding 300 GW of new capacity by 2050. It is reinforced by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which makes continued tax credits available to the nuclear industry. Countries in the European Union, Middle East, Africa, East Asia and North and Central America are also showing renewed interest in nuclear power as part of their decarbonisation strategies. Electrifying final consumption Electrification is one of the key levers in the NZE Scenario to reduce CO2 emissions in the end\u0002use sectors, i.e. industry, transport and buildings. Direct emissions from end-use sectors currently account for more than half of total energy-related CO2 emissions. Electrification provides almost 40% of the emissions reductions from end-uses by 2050. Figure 7.15 ⊳ Electricity demand by use and in total final consumption by end-use sector in the NZE Scenario, 2024-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Industrial demand and electric vehicles drive up the share of electricity over half of total final consumption by 2050 Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour; AC = air conditioning; TFC = total final consumption. Hydrogen production excludes onsite production which is covered in energy-intensive industries. Rising demand in existing end-uses and the electrification of new end-uses in the NZE Scenario led to significant growth in electricity demand, which increases by 4.1% on average per year until 2035, adding an average of 1 400 terawatt-hours (TWh) each year. By 2035, a third of the energy used in end-use sectors comes from electricity, up from one-fifth today. This rises to over half of total final consumption by 2050 (Figure 7.15). The share is higher in the buildings sector and lower in the transport and industry sectors, where 20 40 60 80 2024 2035 2050 Other Hydrogen production Other buildings Heat pumps Appliances and AC Other industry Energy-intensive Electric vehicles Electricity demand Thousand TWh industry 20% 40% 60% 80% 2024 2035 2050 TFC Buildings Industry Transport Share of electricity IEA. CC BY 4.0. 334 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 bioenergy, CCUS, hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels and some residual fossil fuels account for a higher share of the total. In these sectors, low-emissions fuels are required to meet demands for energy that are difficult to electrify, notably in some energy-intensive industries and in aviation and shipping (section 7.3.3). EVs are one of the most important contributors to electricity demand growth. They are central to the decarbonisation of the transport sector, reducing its CO2 emissions by 2.4 Gt by 2035. Heat pumps are the key technology for decarbonisation of buildings through electrification of space heating: their share in space heating increases from around 12% today to 45% by 2050. Heat pumps are also an important technology for decarbonising the industry sector, particularly in non-energy-intensive industries with low temperature heat needs: the share of electricity in non-energy-intensive industries rises from around 40% today to over 50% by 2035. After 2035, technologies currently under development accelerate the electrification of energy-intensive industries (Box 7.4). Box 7.4 ⊳ Emerging technology focus: Direct electrification of energy-intensive industries Direct electrification of processes in energy-intensive industries is challenging because most of them require high temperatures and specific materials for reactions. As a result, the share of electrification in steel, cement and primary chemicals production is well below 15% today. However, there are several technologies under development that could electrify these processes, in some cases directly and in others indirectly, notably by using electricity to produce onsite low-emissions hydrogen. While first demonstration plants for processes such as electrolytic ammonia and methanol or hydrogen-based steel making are already online or under construction, technologies such as iron ore electrolysis or electric steam crackers are at the prototype stage. Integrating these technologies is vital if energy-intensive industries are to be decarbonised. Their use avoids 2.2 Gt CO2 of emissions by 2050 in the NZE Scenario, contributing around a third of combustion emissions reductions in the industry sector. Technologies that are more mature today reach market shares of 30-50% in their respective industries in the NZE Scenario, and electric alumina digestion attains a market share of over 80% by 2050 (Figure 7.16). Technologies at the prototype level today are not deployed as extensively in the NZE Scenario, so there is potential upside if they prove to be feasible in larger demonstration projects. The deployment of electrification technologies in the NZE Scenario has important implications for the electricity system. The electricity demand of all technologies analysed reaches nearly 6 700 TWh by 2050: this is more than twice the electricity consumption of energy-intensive industries today, and accounts for about 10% of total electricity demand in 2050.

Source: TRL is based on IEA (2025a). 7.3.2 Energy efficiency Energy efficiency plays a critical role to boost economic competitiveness, increase affordability of energy and lower overall energy demand. Many efficiency measures have short payback periods and offer attractive opportunities to reduce energy spending and CO2 emissions. Annual global gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 3% in the 2015- 2024 period, while total energy demand increased by 1.6% annually, indicating a relative decoupling of energy demand from economic growth at the global level. At national level, some 40 countries that make up about 30% of total global energy demand are seeing a decline in energy demand even while their GDP continues to grow, indicating a long-term absolute decoupling of energy demand from economic growth. 5 In the NZE Scenario, the annual rate of improvement in energy intensity – defined as the energy demand needed to produce a dollar of economic output – steadily rises to reach 4% on average in the period to 2030. This meets the goal of doubling the rate of annual energy efficiency improvement. 5 Relative decoupling refers to GDP increasing faster than energy demand. Absolute decoupling refers to an absolute decline in energy demand even while GDP continues to grow. 1 520 TWh Iron ore electrolysis Electric cement kiln Silicates for cement Electric steam cracker 2 480 TWh Electrolytic ammonia 1 830 TWh Electrolytic methanol Electric alumina digestion 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% TRL 5 Technology share Hydrogen-based DRI TRL 6 TRL 7 TRL 8 IEA.

Energy efficiency plays an important part in reducing energy demand even as the global economy expands Note: Energy demand in this figure refers to total primary energy demand, also known as total energy supply. In the NZE Scenario, the annual rate of improvement in energy intensity – defined as the energy demand needed to produce a dollar of economic output – steadily rises to reach 4% on average in the period to 2030. This meets the goal of doubling the rate of annual energy efficiency improvement. In the NZE Scenario, energy efficiency is achieved through:  Technical efficiency improvements in equipment and buildings.  Switching from other fuels to electricity in end-uses where feasible, as electricity is much more efficient as an energy carrier than other fuels.  Structural effects such as material efficiency and modal switching.  Shifting to more efficient sources of energy where electrification is not feasible or where those sources are being used to generate electricity, for example when renewables are used in place of less efficient fuels to generate electricity. Together these elements enable energy efficiency to play an important part to reduce energy demand (Figure 7.17). However, the importance of each element varies from sector to sector (Figure 7.18). In the buildings sector, minimum energy performance standards for appliances and energy codes for new construction are combined with policies that boost retrofit rates in the NZE Scenario. By 2035, new space cooling equipment in all markets reaches the performance levels of today’s best available technologies in their respective regions, and there is progress -180 -90 0 90 2024 2030 2035 Economic growth Technical efficiency Electrification Structural effects Other fuel switching Net change Change in energy demand by effect (EJ) 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 2024 2030 2035 Growth in economic activity (2024 = 1) Freight transport Floorspace Industry value added and renewables IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 337 7 toward global best-in-class standards thereafter. Continued electrification of space and water heating equipment also increases efficiency in the buildings sector. Moving to more efficient cooking fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas and electricity reduces energy demand by up to 85% compared to traditional cooking. Figure 7.18 ⊳ Energy consumption by effect in end-use sectors in the NZE Scenario, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Continued energy efficiency gains allow economic growth to go hand-in-hand with reductions in energy consumption In the transport sector, the switch from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs reduces energy consumption because of the higher efficiency of electric motors, regenerative braking and simpler drivetrains: an EV uses 70-80% less energy than a comparable ICE vehicle to travel the same distance. Modal shifts and vehicle downsizing can help to ensure more efficient use of batteries to meet transport needs. For instance, sport utility vehicles today require ten-times more battery capacity per passenger-kilometre than electric buses, and almost three-times more than a small battery electric car. Fuel economy improvements across all types of drive trains and increasing sales of EVs together lead to an absolute reduction in road transport energy consumption even as demand for transport continues to expand. In the industry sector, material efficiency measures such as light weighting products, extension of product lifetimes and enhanced recycling help to reduce the use of energy\u0002intensive materials, while providing consumers with the same level of service. Increases in technical efficiency in industrial motors, drives and processes also contribute. The increasing deployment of artificial intelligence offers scope to bring about further increases in energy efficiency across energy-intensive and non-energy-intensive industries (see Chapter 1). 50 100 150 200 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 Economic growth Technical efficiency Electrification Energy demand Structural effects EJ Transport Buildings Industry and other fuel switching IEA. CC BY 4.0. 338 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 7.3.3 Filling up on low-emissions fuels Although electrification plays a major role to increase efficiency and lower emissions in the NZE Scenario, it cannot fully decarbonise some key end-use sectors. As a result, low\u0002emissions molecules, i.e. hydrogen, hydrogen-based fuels and bioenergy, have a vital role to play to supplement electricity on the path to net zero emissions. In the NZE Scenario, such low-emissions fuels supply around 10% of total final consumption in 2035 and around 20% in 2050, up from 5% today. In the short and medium term, low-emissions molecules have a role to play as drop-in fuels for decarbonising conventional energy technologies; in the long term, they play a significant role in the decarbonisation of some hard-to-abate sectors. Biofuels Liquid biofuel consumption today is dominated by road transport. In the NZE Scenario, EVs are the main route to decarbonise passenger road transport, and continued growth for liquid bioenergy comes from other end-use sectors which rely on energy-dense liquid fuels. These include shipping and aviation, which together account for around 25% of liquid and gaseous bioenergy consumption by 2035 (Figure 7.19). In aviation, biofuels play an important role in the next decade as the primary means of producing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) that can be directly substituted for conventional fossil-based jet fuel. In 2035, around 80% of SAF are biofuels, more than 85% of which are produced from biomass that does not compete with food production. It is not until the 2040s that fuels synthesised from hydrogen and CO2 captured from point sources or the atmosphere become an important source of SAF in the NZE scenario. The use of heat pumps brings about a shift to electricity for much of space heating and many non-energy-intensive industrial processes, but some buildings and non-energy-intensive industrial processes are difficult or costly to electrify, notably those processes that require high-temperature heat. Bioenergy plays a role to reduce emissions in these cases, especially for buildings and industries that remain connected to natural gas infrastructure. Emerging market and developing economies are the largest source of expansion, with blended biomethane playing an important role to decarbonise gas networks that supply domestic heating and non-energy-intensive industries, meeting around 10% and 7% respectively of those energy demands by 2050. This increase in blending leads to significant growth in biogas demand compared to liquid biofuels. Biogases can be deployed in hard-to-abate sectors using existing infrastructure. They also tend to score well on energy security metrics because they are usually consumed close to the sites where they are produced, and because they can be stored more cheaply than electricity. The IEA 2025 update to the Outlook for Biogas and Biomethane used geospatial analysis to demonstrate that almost 25% of today’s natural gas demand could be met sustainably by biogases (IEA, 2025b). The NZE Scenario does not rely on all this potential being tapped: it envisages biogas demand reaching 15 EJ in 2050, or around 10% of current demand for natural gas. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 339 7 Figure 7.19 ⊳ Fuel demand met by liquid bioenergy and biogases relative to electricity for key end-uses in the NZE Scenario, 2024-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy demand that is hard to electrify relies heavily on low-emissions molecules to decarbonise Notes: Liquid bioenergy includes biogasoline, biodiesel, biomethanol and bio-jet kerosene, i.e. biogenic SAF; biogases include biogas and biomethane. Solid biofuel, including modern and traditional use of biomass, is not shown. Biofuels depend on land use for their production. Expanding the use of biofuels is constrained by competition for other land uses, e.g. forest conservation and forest restoration. Total bioenergy and waste consumption in the NZE Scenario is just over 100 EJ in 2050, which is approximately equivalent to conservative estimates for its sustainable global production potential (Creutzig, 2014). In contrast with current production, which relies mainly on constrained supplies of food crops and waste vegetable oil, the NZE Scenario sees increasing amounts of liquid biofuels produced from short rotation woody biomass crops, which can be grown on marginal land but still produce twice as much bioenergy per hectare as existing bioenergy crops. Woody biomass is also used as solid bioenergy with minimal processing in several sectors, particularly power, energy-intensive industries and space heating. Converting these crops into drop-in liquid fuels requires advanced technologies, of which the NZE Scenario sees production rise from low levels today to nearly 5 EJ by 2035. Adoption of biofuels is influenced by costs as well as supply limitations. The main cost driver for existing commercial biofuels is feedstock, which accounts for more than 80% of the total cost of production. These production costs vary significantly over time and between regions: at times they have fallen below the equivalent fossil fuel price. Looking forward, increasing competition for biofuels reduces the incidence of very low prices and increases the lowest prices at which existing commercial biofuels can be produced (Figure 7.20). The share of feedstocks in the cost of emerging biofuel technologies is lower than for existing commercial 10% 20% 30% 40% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Electricity fuel share Shipping Aviation Road Non-energy intensive industry Space heating Liquid bioenergy and biogases fuel share 2024 2035 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 340 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 options, reflecting the high capital and operating costs of the biofuel conversion processes. However, these conversion costs decline slightly over time, reducing the costs of emerging biofuel technologies and bringing them closer to those of existing commercial biofuels: in the case of biogasoline, it brings costs into the historical range of fossil end-user prices. Figure 7.20 ⊳ Existing commercial and emerging liquid biofuel costs relative to fossil equivalent prices, 2024 and 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Biofuel costs are highly uncertain, but can be competitive with fossil alternatives; emerging biofuel technologies become more competitive over time as processing costs fall Notes: GJ = gigajoule; MER = market exchange rate. Historical and projected feedstock prices for existing commercial biofuels are taken from OECD-FAO (2025), the variation in which underpins the range in cost estimates. Box 7.5 ⊳ Emerging technology focus: What next for bioethanol? More than half of liquid biofuels in use today are based on bioethanol produced from food crops. Bioethanol plays an important role in decarbonising the road sector, particularly in regions where it is already widely deployed, but growth opportunities are limited because of the widespread electrification of vehicles. Continued expansion therefore depends on the extent to which other applications are found, particularly in the heavy-duty transport sector, where there is a higher level of uncertainty about the lowest cost routes to decarbonisation. In the aviation sector, alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) pathways are a promising option for upgrading bioethanol, and demonstration projects are under way in both Europe and the United States. In the NZE Scenario, these pathways account for over 10% of SAF production in 2035. Because bioethanol can be produced from a range of feedstocks, AtJ pathways have much higher SAF production potential than today’s dominant hydrotreated esters 15 30 45 60 2024 2035 2024 2035 2024 2035 2014-2024 fossil equivalent price (excluding tax) Existing commercial Emerging Biogasoline USD per GJ (2024, MER) Biodiesel Bio-jet kerosene IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 341 7 and fatty acids pathway which produces fuels from vegetable oils, waste oils and fats. However, the ability of AtJ to compete with more established technologies for alternative fuel production like the Fischer-Tropsch process has yet to be demonstrated. In the shipping sector, bioethanol does not currently meet the requirements for consideration as a sustainable fuel by the FuelEU Maritime regulation if produced from a food crop. As a result, its future use depends to a considerable extent on whether it can be produced affordably using waste material. If this hurdle can be overcome, it could be a competitive option, since it is denser and less toxic than some other biofuels like biomethanol. In regions with established production and robust regulatory frameworks for sustainable production chains, bioethanol may offer an option for near-term emissions reductions where existing infrastructure could be used to make it available for bunkering before other types of sustainable fuel are viable. Hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels In addition to biofuels, low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels can support decarbonisation in parts of the energy sector where other mitigation measures are more difficult or costly. In the NZE Scenario, low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels account for 2% of total final consumption by 2035, increasing to almost 10% by 2050. However, their share is much higher in sectors such as aviation and shipping. Low-emissions hydrogen and ammonia are also used as fuels for electricity generation. Around 100 million tonnes of hydrogen (Mt H2) were used in the energy sector in 2024, of which around 55% was in industry, mostly to produce ammonia and methanol, and around 45% was in refineries for hydrocracking and desulphurisation processes (Figure 7.21). Today, hydrogen is almost entirely produced from unabated fossil fuels, resulting in CO2 emissions of 980 Mt CO2. Low-emissions hydrogen meets less than 1% of global hydrogen demand. Low-emissions hydrogen production rapidly scales up in the NZE Scenario, and over 35% of all hydrogen used in the industry sector by 2035 comes from low-emissions sources. The two largest electrolyser projects in the world that have received a final investment decision (FID) are in Saudi Arabia (2.2 GW) and India (1.3 GW): both will use low-emissions hydrogen to produce ammonia. In refineries, low-emissions hydrogen meets around 30% of hydrogen demand by 2035. The iron and steel sub-sectors start to make use of low-emissions hydrogen: several projects that plan to use low-emissions hydrogen in the direct reduced iron (DRI) are under development, and eight projects with an electrolyser capacity at or above 100 megawatts (MW) have received FID approvals, the largest of which is being built in Sweden with an electrolyser capacity of 800 MW. In the transport sector, hydrogen is already used in road transport, but it plays a minor role, with only 100 000 fuel cell vehicles on the road worldwide and 1 300 hydrogen refuelling stations in operation in 2024. In the NZE Scenario, the role of hydrogen in road transport remains limited. However, the use of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels expands in other IEA. CC BY 4.0. 342 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 parts of the transport sector where the direct use of electricity is more difficult. In the shipping industry, more than 65 methanol-powered vessels were in operation as of October 2025, running on methanol derived from fossil fuels, and an additional 300 ships are on the order books of shipping companies. In the NZE Scenario, low-emissions ammonia, synthetic methanol and hydrogen rapidly displace other fuels, and between them they meet around 30% of the energy needs for shipping in the NZE Scenario by 2035. In the aviation sector, synthetic kerosene, from a power-to-liquid process, is not being used today, though mandates for its future use have been put into force in the European Union and the United Kingdom. By 2035, it meets 3% of global aviation fuel demand in the NZE Scenario, and this share rises rapidly in later years. Figure 7.21 ⊳ Hydrogen demand by sector to 2050, and hydrogen fuel use in selected sub-sectors, 2035 and 2050, in the NZE Scenario IEA. CC BY 4.0. Low-emissions hydrogen replaces hydrogen from unabated fossil fuels in refining and industry and takes an increasing share in shipping, aviation and electricity generation Notes: HCF = hydrocarbon fuels. Other includes buildings and agriculture. The share of low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuel use refers to the share of these fuels in energy consumption in the sub\u0002sector. For chemicals and steel, the total energy consumption includes the energy use for onsite low-emissions hydrogen production. Low-emissions hydrogen and ammonia are not used in electricity generation today, but they could help to reduce emissions from existing plants while also providing flexibility for the electricity system. In the longer term, power plants running entirely on hydrogen or ammonia and combined with hydrogen storage could become a seasonal electricity storage option. In the NZE Scenario, low-emissions hydrogen and ammonia meet around 1.5% of the total fuel needs in the global power sector by 2035. 10 20 30 40 20242030203520502024203020352050 Industry Transport Refining Power Other Hydrogen Ammonia Synthetic HCF Hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuel demand EJ Unabated Low-emissions Chemicals Steel Aviation Shipping 15% 30% 45% 60% 20352050 2035205020352050 20352050 Share of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 343 7 Box 7.6 ⊳ Emerging technology focus: Geological hydrogen Geological hydrogen can be broadly grouped into two categories: natural hydrogen and stimulated geological hydrogen. Natural hydrogen refers to hydrogen that has accumulated in subsurface reservoirs. The only documented well producing natural hydrogen is in Bourakébougou, Mali, with a production rate of about 5 tonnes of hydrogen per year. Stimulated geological hydrogen is produced by artificially accelerating the natural hydrogen generating reaction in iron-rich rocks using chemical, physical or biologicalstimulation. Stimulating the production of geologic production is still at an early development stage and has been demonstrated so far only in the laboratory. Natural hydrogen exploration activities are now underway in more than ten countries. In the United States, for example, the US Geological Survey released a map for the first time in 2024 showing likely areas to explore for hydrogen. In France, two natural hydrogen deposits were discovered in 2023 and 2025; the size of the earlier discovery has been estimated at 46 Mt (Ruffine et al., 2025). The Philippines launched the world’s first natural hydrogen exploration auction in 2024 covering 230 000 ha near Manila. Venture capital is investing in geological hydrogen: start-up companies attracted USD 300 million in 2024. Over 40 companies are searching for natural hydrogen deposits commercially, and some developers have announced that they expect to be able to extract natural hydrogen at estimated costs of around USD 1 per kilogramme of hydrogen. However, commercial development remains uncertain due to limited understanding of reservoir behaviour and replenishment rates, and to the lack of demonstration of sustained production at scale. 7.3.4 Cutting energy-related methane emissions Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures that has taken place since the industrial revolution (IPCC, 2021a). Rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limit near-term global warming and to improve air quality. Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than CO₂, around 12 years for methane versus centuries for CO₂, but it absorbs much more energy while it remains in the atmosphere. Today the concentration of methane in the atmosphere is over two-and-a-half times above pre-industrial levels. Atmospheric records show that, in relative terms, methane concentrations have been rising more quickly than those of all other major GHGs, and at a rate faster than in any period since recordkeeping began. The energy sector, including oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy, accounts for more than 35% of methane emissions from human activity. The fossil fuel sector offers significant potential for rapid and low-cost reductions in methane emissions. In the NZE Scenario, methane emissions from the energy sector fall by more than 80% by 2035 as all available mitigation measures are deployed across energy supply chains (Figure 7.22). IEA. CC BY 4.0. 344 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Figure 7.22 ⊳ Opportunities to reduce methane emissions in the energy sector, 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Measures to reduce methane emissions are available across the value chains of all fuels Note: Mt = million tonne. Nearly half of global oil and gas production is covered by corporate near zero methane targets. Measures to lower methane emissions from fossil fuels to near zero already exist and could be deployed today at little cost. Around 30% of total methane emissions from oil, gas and coal could be avoided at no net cost, based on 2024 average energy prices. This is because the required outlays for abatement measures are less than the market value of the additional methane gas captured and used or sold. There are many reasons why companies may fail to invest in methane abatement despite positive rates of return. Companies could be unaware of the scale of the problem or the available solutions or may not have identified an effective route or business case to bring captured methane to productive use. There may be higher profile opportunities competing for resources, or contractual arrangements may fail to incentivise methane savings. It may also be difficult to secure the capital required for upfront investment, especially in developing economies. The implementation of tried and tested policy measures, such as leak detection and repair (LDAR) requirements and a ban on routine flaring and venting, could cut global oil and gas emissions of methane by more than half. Additional measures, for example establishing emissions pricing, financing instruments and performance standards, could lead to an 85% reduction by 2035. Almost all these abatement measures would be cost effective to deploy with a GHG emissions price of about USD 20 per tonne of carbon-dioxide equivalent. Novel applications of technologies for associated gas utilisation, continuous LDAR systems and process improvements offer ways to go further to reduce oil and gas emissions.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 345 7 applications include the use of methane monitoring towers equipped with specialised sensors, use of artificial intelligence for predictive maintenance, and use of automated air\u0002fuel controls to increase combustion efficiencies. Tests are underway to deploy methane oxidation catalyst systems that tackle methane emissions from incomplete combustion, which are also known as methane slips, from marine LNG engines. In the coal sector, methane emissions could be halved through effective methane utilisation in mines, or by deploying flaring or oxidation technologies when energy recovery is not viable. Drainage systems could be used to direct coal mine methane to power generation, heating or processing ahead of pipeline injection. Net costs to deploy these solutions globally at scale would amount to less than USD 5 billion per year. In the bioenergy sector, accelerating access to clean cooking and modern heating would eliminate most methane emissions from the incomplete combustion of bioenergy (see Chapter 6), while the application of best available technologies, e.g. gastight digestate (a byproduct of anaerobic digestion) storage at biogas plants, would minimise emissions from modern bioenergy supply. Biogas production could also help reduce methane emissions from waste and agriculture. Existing high-level pledges on methane, including the Global Methane Pledge, cover around 80% of global fossil fuel production. There is scope for importing countries to help drive significant cuts in methane emissions in exporting countries through economic incentives or trade measures, such as the import standards referenced by the European Union Methane Regulation, and for investors to contribute by promoting performance standards and pushing for verifiable methane reductions together with transparent and comparable disclosures on measured emissions. 7.4 Implications 7.4.1 Investment Transformation of the energy sector in the NZE Scenario involves the roll out of technologies with high capital costs, but generally low operating costs, across the energy system. Reflecting this, total annual energy sector investment increases, reaching USD 4.8 trillion on average in the next decade, and rising to USD 5.6 trillion in 2035. This latter figure is around 70% higher than today’s level and over 50% higher than in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). Clean electrification is a key driver of emissions reductions in the NZE Scenario, and annual global investment in the power sector reaches over USD 2.5 trillion by 2035, almost double today’s level. Low-emissions power generation and grid infrastructure account for nearly 90% of investment in the power sector since 2020, and this share increases to almost 100% by 2035. Investment in renewable sources of electricity dominates powersector investment, nearly doubling to reach almost USD 1.3 trillion on average in the next decade. Between 2025 and 2035, annual spending on grids and storage rises to USD 800 billion, and annual IEA. CC BY 4.0. 346 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 spending on nuclear power to USD 150 billion. In both instances, this is double the level of annual investment from 2020-2024. Figure 7.23 ⊳ Annual energy sector investment by sector, 2015-2024, and in the NZE Scenario to 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Spending on renewables, grids and storage, energy efficiency and electrification accelerate rapidly over the next decade Note: MER = market exchange rate; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. On the demand side, the NZE Scenario sees rapid electrification of final energy use across the buildings, transport and industry sectors, driven by the swift deployment of EVs and heat pumps. This translates into average spending on electrification of over USD 900 billion each year to 2035 – a tripling from current levels. Average annual investment in energy efficiency in the buildings sector alone approaches USD 600 billion per year over the next decade. Annual average investment in efficiency in transport and industry also nearly doubles, though from a smaller base, reaching about USD 160 billion and USD 70 billion respectively. The scale up in investment in low-emissions technologies and energy efficiency in the NZE Scenario brings down the investment requirement in fossil fuels. Compared to an annual average spending of around USD 1 trillion in fossil fuel supply in recent years, investment in the NZE Scenario falls to an average of less than USD 350 billion per year in 2035. As in previous editions of the NZE Scenario, upstream investment is directed towards maintaining the output of existing fields, as – in the absence of such investment – their natural decline rates would exceed the rate of decline of fossil fuel demand in the NZE Scenario. By 2050, the energy system still consumes some fossil fuels, with emissions from unabated fossil fuels offset by BECCS and DACS or fossil fuel emissions abated with CCUS. This means that fossil fuel supply investment does not drop to zero even by 2050, but it falls 90% compared to today. 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 4 5 2015-19 2020-24 2025-35 Electrification Energy efficiency Grids and storage Nuclear Renewable power Low-emissions fuels Coal Natural gas Oil Share of low-emissions Trillion USD (2024, MER) technologies (right axis) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 347 7 7.4.2 Social inclusion Affordability for households How changes in investment, fuel prices and operating costs ultimately impact the affordability of energy for end-usersis a key issue in all our scenarios. The IEA has extensively explored the implications of transitions to net zero emissions such as the NZE Scenario on overall affordability. Here, we focus on household energy consumption, including both residential and transport energy use. There are three main dynamics at play: a large increase in upfront spending on clean energy equipment; a shift away from spending on direct fossil fuels like gasoline and towards electricity; and regulatory interventions that add CO2 costs, remove fossil fuel subsidies and provide incentives for the uptake of low-emissions technologies. The most immediate implication of the NZE Scenario for households is a large increase in spending on EVs, building retrofits and appliances, especially heating and cooling equipment. This increase means that households in advanced economies spend on average around USD 650 per year more on these technologies than they do today. This figure considers that many households will spread payments for large purchases such as EVs, heat pumps or building renovations over a number of years. Figure 7.24 ⊳ Average annual household energy expenditure in advanced economies in the NZE Scenario, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In advanced economies, increased household investment in low-emissions equipment is offset by lower spending on energy bills over time Notes: MER = market exchange rate. Spending on clean energy options only reflects the share which is borne by households, minus any public subsidies or fiscal incentives. Over time, households in advanced economies see a sharp reduction in expenditure on gasoline and diesel as more of their energy needs are met with low-emissions electricity.

CC BY 4.0. 348 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 2035, average household spending on oil products falls to around USD 700 per year in the NZE Scenario, down from about USD 2 000/year today. Over the same period, electricity expenditure increases only slightly from around USD 1 200/year to USD 1 300/year. As a result, overall household energy bills are lower. This reduction is driven by the widespread electrification of end-uses – most notably the uptake of EVs and electrification of heating – alongside efficiency gains from building retrofits and appliances. In general, electrification enables households to consume less energy for the same level of service, thanks to the superior efficiency of electric technologies. Additional household investment in low-emissions technologies on average lead to larger energy savings, reducing total energy expenditure by households in advanced economies by around 15%. These gains particularly benefit lower income households, which tend to need to spend a higher proportion of their income on energy than wealthier households. For instance, some households in the lowest income decile currently spend over 30% of disposable income on energy services: this share declines to less than 20% in 2035 in the NZE Scenario. Though these gains depend on lower income households being able to fund the upfront purchase costs of low-emissions technologies, and this may only be possible if subsidies or other support measures are available. The other major implication of the NZE Scenario for households is that a set of changes in regulations and policies affects the costs of different energy services, notably through the introduction of CO2 pricing, the removal of untargeted fossil fuel subsidies, and an increase in financial support for the adoption of clean energy technologies.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 349 7 Managing the removal of fossil fuel subsidies while protecting low-income households and keeping fiscal budgets balanced would be a major challenge for some emerging market and developing economies and could be especially difficult for major producer economies whose revenues from fossil fuel exports decline in the NZE Scenario. However, the removal of untargeted subsidies and introduction of CO2 pricing in the NZE Scenario also create new revenue streams and reduce fiscal burdens. These new revenues could be used to provide extra assistance for low-income households, for example through payments to reduce energy bills or to help them invest in low-emissions energy equipment. Box 7.7 ⊳ Energy employment in the NZE Scenario Global energy employment expands by more than 14.5 million jobs by 2035 in the NZE Scenario, an 20% increase from 2024 compared with increases of 4% in the Current Policies Scenario and 6% in the Stated Policies Scenario. Most of the growth comes in the power sector, where the number of jobs rises to 36 million, driven by a doubling of low\u0002emissions jobs related to electricity generation and a 50% expansion in the electricity grids workforce. Vehicle manufacturing also undergoes a major shift, with EVs projected to account for 90% of vehicle industry employment by 2035. Employment in the fossil fuels sectors contracts in the NZE Scenario, with coal declining by 60% and oil and gas by 45%, underscoring the importance of just transition policies to support affected workers.

CC BY 4.0. 350 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Yet even if the direction is clear, the speed of transition may be constrained by labour market realities. Skilled labour shortages, already a challenge in today’s energy sector, would intensify in the NZE Scenario. Trades workers, such as electricians, welders, and line workers, are expected to remain the largest occupational group in the energy sector, with more than 5.8 million additional workers needed between 2024 and 2035. At the same time, acquiring new skills to address the growing importance of digitalisation, automation and AI will require large-scale reskilling and upskilling. Air pollution Ambient (outdoor) air pollution caused about 4.5 million premature deaths in 2024, and there were about 2.5 million premature deaths related to household air pollution, mainly smoke from burning fuelwood for cooking. Over 90% of the premature deaths occurred in emerging market and developing economies, where forty percent of people breathe heavily polluted air daily which adversely impacts human health and economic productivity. Figure 7.27 ⊳ Volume and share of population exposure to heavy air pollution by source, and premature deaths by economic grouping in 2024 and in 2035 in the NZE Scenario IEA. CC BY 4.0. Exposure to heavy air pollution drops by 80% in the NZE Scenario, resulting in 4 million fewer premature deaths per year by 2035 relative to 2024 Notes: Mt = million tonnes; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. HAP = household air pollution; AAP = ambient air pollution. Air pollution emissions include the sum of SO2, NOX, and PM2.5 with concentrations ≥ 35 microgrammes per cubic metre. Over the past decade, less use of coal for electricity generation, tighter fuel standards and early progress to broaden access to clean cooking options have helped to reduce air pollution emissions in some regions, yet progress has been uneven around the world.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 351 7 Scenario leads to rapid cuts in all pollutants in all regions. By 2035, emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) in aggregate fall by 70% in advanced economies, driven largely by less oil use in road transport, and almost 80% in emerging market and developing economies, driven by less use of coal in power generation. The benefits by 2035 include that the number of people exposed to heavily polluted air falls to essentially zero in advanced economies and drops fivefold in emerging market and developing economies compared to the current level. These emissions cuts deliver public health benefits. By 2035, around 2 fewer million people per year die prematurely from ambient air pollution compared to today; 85% of these avoided deaths are in emerging market and developing economies. Universal access to clean cooking avoids around 2.1 million deaths per year from household air pollution, a drop of 85%. 7.4.3 Energy security The NZE Scenario presents a complex set of opportunities and challenges for energy security, requiring careful attention from policy makers. This section addresses various issues related to energy security along the path to net zero emissions. Fuel security As investment in low-emissions energy supply and energy efficiency is scaled up in the NZE Scenario, investments in the supply of fossil fuels and in the construction and maintenance of related infrastructure are scaled back. However, they do not drop to zero. Continued investment is required to counteract the effect of natural decline rates in oil and gas fields (IEA, 2025c), and some infrastructure, such as natural gas networks, import terminals or natural gas peaking plants, are needed for some time to provide buffers for the energy system. The transition will therefore require careful sequencing of the scaling up of low-emissions energy supply; continued operations, maintenance and possible repurposing of critical fuel supply infrastructure; and eventual safe decommissioning. As low-emissions energy meets an ever-growing share of demand in the NZE Scenario, the production of oil and natural gas becomes concentrated in low-cost suppliers. In the NZE Scenario, the share of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries + (OPEC+) in oil supply increases to around 55% by 2035. Governments will need to decide whether to seek to preserve domestic production and/or stockholding capacity for oil and gas to provide a counterweight to this increasing geographical concentration. In the NZE Scenario, prices in international fuel markets fall in line with declining demand. This has beneficial effects for fuel importers, which see fuel import bills cut by more than two-thirds by 2035. However, lower revenues for producer economies in the NZE Scenario imply significant macroeconomic and fiscal challenges, given the reliance of these economies on revenues from the sale of fuels in international markets, and a consequent need for proactive economic diversification policies. IEA. CC BY 4.0. 352 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Electricity security The NZE Scenario implies sharper challenges for electricity security. As electricity comes to provide over half of the energy consumed around the world by 2050 in the NZE Scenario, the economic consequences of potential disruptions increase. The electricity sector becomes more complex in the NZE Scenario, with growing supply from variable sources of generation and increasing consumption from a wide range of end-uses such as EVs and heat pumps. Maintaining electricity security will require a diverse portfolio of measures. Dispatchable capacity will be critical to balance the power systems and particularly to meet seasonal flexibility needs. In the NZE Scenario, total installed dispatchable capacity, excluding batteries, is maintained broadly at current levels through to 2035, even as variable sources of generation take an increasing share of generation. Dispatchable renewables such as hydropower, geothermal and bioenergy play a role here, as does nuclear power. As their costs fall sharply, batteries come to play an increasingly important role to absorb surplus renewables and meet peak demand. The installed capacity of batteries reaches around 2 900 GW by 2035, an 11-fold increase from the current level; this is in line with the scaling up of the installed capacity of solar PV over the past decade. While batteries are well-suited today to provide short-term flexibility needs for durations of several hours, other forms of longer duration storage, such as pumped hydro, are also needed. Demand-response measures offer significant but still underutilised potential to make electricity systems more flexible and secure. Tapping this potential will require incentives and market structures that value demand response, infrastructure such as smart controls, and the innovative use of technology to manage controllable loads efficiently and securely. Overbuilding of renewables projects and curtailment of surplus generation can contribute to cost-effective strategies to ensure electricity security in systems with high penetration of renewables. Electricity grids see high levels of investment in the NZE Scenario, reflecting the need for expansion and modernisation to ensure the timely connection of generation and load projects, and the need to ensure that the grid can play a crucial role in electricity security. Critical minerals security Demand for critical minerals rises much faster in the NZE Scenario than in other scenarios. For example, demand for copper – fundamental to all electrical applications – is around 25% higher in 2035 than in the STEPS. Lithium demand is 70% higher. Nickel, cobalt and graphite demand is 30-50% higher. While concerns around supply concentration remain crucial, additional volume challenges emerge in the NZE Scenario (Figure 7.28). In the STEPS, recent project announcements have narrowed expected supply gaps for many minerals, however, copper is a notable exception. In the NZE Scenario, most minerals still require additional projects, further innovation and expanded recycling to bridge the gap between supply and demand. For example, expected copper supply from existing and announced projects in 2035 falls short of projected demand by over 40%, compared with IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 7 | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 353 7 around 30% in the STEPS. For nickel and cobalt, announced projects are broadly sufficient to meet demand growth in the STEPS, but shortfalls remain in the NZE Scenario. Figure 7.28 ⊳ Critical mineral primary supply requirements and expected supply from existing and announced projects by scenario, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Additional supply, further innovation and expanded recycling are required to bridge the gap between critical mineral supply and demand in the NZE Scenario Note: Mt = million tonne; Mt Li = million tonnes of lithium metal content; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. Unreliable supply of critical minerals could significantly affect both the pace of progress and the cost of achieving the goals in the NZE Scenario. Some minerals account for a large share of total energy technology costs, so price spikes would inevitably have implications for manufacturing costs and ultimately for consumer prices (see Chapter 5). Supply disruptions could also derail efforts to diversify energy technology manufacturing, concentrating supply chains further and affecting industrial development and jobs. Action is needed both in the near term to strengthen preparedness for potential disruptions, and in the medium term to diversify supply chains and mitigate structural risks. Securing reliable critical mineral supplies is essential not only for energy security but also to ensure an orderly, affordable energy transition consistent with the 1.5 °C goal. 7.4.4 Implications for the next ten years By 2035, the NZE Scenario sees global energy-related emissions fall by around 50% from 2024 levels, and electricity use rise to account for one-third of total final consumption. The installed capacity of renewables reaches around 19 600 GW, increasing fourfold from 2024. Other low-emissions sources such as nuclear also see rapid growth, enabling deep cuts to be made in electricity sector emissions. The average annual increase in energy efficiency is 0.5 1.0 1.5 NZE STEPS Lithium Mt Li Primary supply requirements: 15 30 45 Base case High production Copper Mt Expected supply: 0.2 0.4 0.6 Cobalt Mt 3 6 9 Nickel Mt IEA. CC BY 4.0. 354 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 maintained at around 4% per year through to 2035, compared with 2% in 2022. Deep cuts in energy sector methane emissions help to lower peak warming, avoiding an even higher overshoot of the 1.5 °C goal. By 2035, energy sector methane emissions are 80% lower than today. Deployment of options that have a critical role to cut emissions in the longer term start to accelerate by 2035 in the NZE Scenario. Total CO₂ capture increases to around 2 260 Mt, a more than 50-fold increase over today’s levels (Table 7.1). Of this, around 660 Mt is removed from the atmosphere, up from near zero today. Removals are indispensable not only to reach net zero emissions by 2050 but also to achieve net negative emissions in the second-half of the century and thus bringing warming back below 1.5 °C by 2100. Hydrogen and hydrogen\u0002based fuels, new nuclear reactor designs, advanced geothermal, novel storage technologies and other innovative technologies also start to be widely deployed. Low-emissions hydrogen production, for example, rises from less than 1 Mt today to around 125 Mt by 2035.

Chapter 8 | Regional insights 357 Chapter 8 Regional insights Diverse priorities, diverse pathways • This chapter explores energy sector trends and priorities in countries and regions that cumulatively account for around 90% of the world’s population, GDP and energy demand. Priorities, objectives and national circumstances vary widely between and within regions, but two trends that are visible in most parts of the world are a rise in the electrification of end-uses, and a rise in the share of renewables in electricity generation. • Energy trends in advanced economies are shaped by the structure of their economies, and by high average incomes and rates of vehicle and appliance ownership. Overall energy demand typically has peaked, although electricity use continues to increase, with electric vehicles and data centres adding to demand. • Energy demand per capita is generally lower in emerging market and developing economies. Many of these countries are still developing their industries, some suffer from a lack of universal access to energy, and most have lower average incomes and levels of ownership of energy consuming equipment than advanced economies. However, the picture is a dynamic one: many countries are undergoing rapid urbanisation, building infrastructure, making swift progress on access to modern energy, and seeing their economies and their demand for energy grow strongly. • Energy security is a key determinant of energy policies. While energy security is a broad term that includes affordability and supply chain resilience, an often cited metric is import dependence on fuels, notably oil, natural gas and coal. Several large economies are net importers of energy. These include Japan, Korea, European Union, India and China. Others, notably the Middle East, Eurasia, Africa and the United States, are net exporters of energy. A high level of import dependence can act as a spur to boost renewable and nuclear energy, diversify sources of supply and improve energy efficiency. • This chapter explores energy pathways in different countries and regions. It also includes a deep dive into a pertinent topic for each region. For the United States, Latin America and Africa, we explore themes that focus on the development of domestic resources. For India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, we explore the strategies and policies being deployed to manage energy demand growth in ways that are aligned with country and regional priorities. For the European Union, Japan and Korea, we explore themes of competitiveness and energy security. We also explore the future of coal demand in China, and prospects for natural gas exports from Russia. SUMMARY IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Chapter 8 | Regional insights 359 8 8.1 Introduction This chapter explores energy sector pathways for countries and regions that together account for nearly 90% of the world’s population, gross domestic product (GDP) and energy demand. Key economic, demographic and energy sector metrics vary widely between these regions, reflecting their diverse histories and shaping their future policy priorities. Our analysis traces how regional trends have evolved over time by examining the changes that have taken place across a range of indicators. China, followed by India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East have been the main engines of growth over the past decade – accounting for over 90% of the increase in global energy demand and nearly 60% of global GDP growth (Figure 8.1). The rise in their energy demand has been driven by increasing industrialisation and urbanisation, plus expanding ownership of appliances and vehicles. There has been a gradual move toward less energy-intensive economic activities in some other regions, along with a focus on improving efficiency. These trends are particularly pronounced in advanced economies, where energy needs have begun to plateau or even decline. For example, energy demand in the European Union in 2024 was about 10% lower than in 2015, even though its economy grew by nearly 20% in this period. There are also lingering impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, as some sectors – notably industry – did not rebound in some regions. Figure 8.1 ⊳ Change in energy demand by fuel and average annual GDP growth rate by region/country, 2015-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. 360 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 The energy landscape looks markedly different when considering per capita energy demand (Figure 8.2). Countries and regions including the United States, parts of Eurasia, advanced Asian economies, and the Middle East have relatively high per capita energy demand as a result of a combination of factors including higher incomes, significant heating or cooling needs, the presence of a large industrial base, and in some cases fossil fuel subsidies. At the other end of the spectrum, per capita demand in Africa remains very low, not least because almost one billion people still lack access to clean cooking and almost 600 million people lack access to electricity, mainly in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Figure 8.2 ⊳ Energy demand per capita and population by region/country, 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. There are wide variations in per capita energy demand across countries and regions Note: GJ = gigajoule; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean. Energy demand per capita corresponds to the ratio of total energy demand to population. Another metric that reveals significant variations across regions is the share of electricity generation accounted for by low-emissions sources, which accounted for 41% of global electricity generation in 2024, of which 32% is from renewables and 9% from nuclear. The European Union (EU)sources over 70% of its electricity from low-emissions sources, of which 48% is renewables and 23% is nuclear. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) report an even higher renewable share at 63%, which is mostly hydropower, but nuclear has a much smaller share. At the other end of the scale, today low-emissions sources have a very small share in power generation in the Middle East, where natural gas and oil dominate the generation mix. The share of electricity in total final consumption is another important metric (Figure 8.3). Japan and Korea long led in this regard, and are now joined by China as the most electrified regions, reflecting the rapid uptake of electricity use in industry, increasing appliance ownership, expanding demand for space cooling and growing electromobility.

Figure 8.3 ⊳ Electricity in total final consumption and low-emissions sources in electricity generation by region, 2000-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Renewables and nuclear electricity have evolved unevenly across regions since 2000, end-use electrification also varied, growing particularly rapidly in Asian economies Stark differences in fossil fuel import dependence – often cited as an indicator of energy security – are apparent across the various regions. Today, well over 80% of oil demand in Japan, Korea, European Union and India is met by imports, and the same goes for over 40% of natural gas demand in these regions and China (Figure 8.4). A high level of dependence on imported fossil fuels can spur efforts to boost renewables and nuclear energy, diversify sources of supply and improve energy efficiency. New national climate commitments known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are due in 2025 from the signatories of the Paris Agreement. As of 5 November 2025, 74 parties representing about 55% of global energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions had submitted new NDCs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat (Table 8.1). A further 50 countries are due to communicate their NDC before or at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) COP30 in Belém, Brazil. The full impact of new NDCs will be reflected in future analysis. The rest of this chapter takes a closer look at different regions.

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in 2025 signals a renewed emphasis on domestic energy production – notably coal, nuclear, geothermal, oil and natural gas – and energy infrastructure development. The OBBBA mandates oil and gas lease sales on federal lands and offshore areas; reinstates tax deductions for drilling; and maintains, extends or enhances tax credits for carbon capture technologies, nuclear power, geothermal energy, bioenergy and battery storage. It also accelerates the phase-out of tax credits for wind, solar photovoltaics (PV) and electric vehicles (EVs). These policy changes, along with a series of regulatory, federal staffing, and public funding and financing changes, are re-shaping the US energy landscape. Figure 8.5 ⊳ Total energy demand by source in the United States in the CPS, 2000-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Natural gas demand continues to increase into the 2030s and then declines slightly, coal demand gradually falls, nuclear capacity increases significantly Note: EJ = exajoule. In the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), total energy demand in the United States is projected to rise by 0.5% per year to 2035, marking a return to growth after broadly stable demand over the past two decades. Natural gas sees significant growth in demand to 2035 and remains the largest US energy source through to 2050 (Figure 8.5). Oil demand continues to slowly increase in the medium and plateaus in the long term, while coal steadily declines to 2050.

CC BY 4.0. 364 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 supportive policies and strong interest from technology firms. This nuclear comeback depends on continuing efforts to develop the workforce and supply chains for construction and fuels. Bioenergy remains the largest renewable energy source through to 2050, while solar PV and wind power continue to expand, albeit more slowly than in recent years. The power sector and the various end-use sectors in the United States each have a distinct energy mix, but they all see rising energy demand in the CPS (Figure 8.6). In transport, oil remains dominant, accounting for over 80% of total transport energy use each year to 2050. In the buildings sector, electricity continues to play a central role, meeting nearly all new demand and gradually displacing oil use, while natural gas consumption remains broadly stable. However, natural gas does meet the largest share of new demand for data centres (Box 8.1). Industry maintains a diverse fuel mix, with natural gas meeting half of new demand, while oil and electricity use also increase. In the power sector, natural gas demand continues to rise to 2035, and it remains the largest source of electricity generation through to 2050. Demand also increases for a broad array of renewable energy technologies, including next-generation geothermal, bioenergy, hydropower, solar PV and wind. Figure 8.6 ⊳ Total final consumption by sector and fuel, and electricity generation by fuel in the United States in the CPS, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Oil demand in transport stays broadly flat, while natural gas demand rises in the power sector to 2035, and electricity use in buildings – including data centres – grows Note: EJ = exajoule; TWh = terawatt-hour. The long-term outlook is inevitably uncertain: it will alter as the policy framework evolves, and as energy stakeholders adapt to that evolution. In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the US trajectory reflects stronger influence from state-level actions that include, among other things, renewable portfolio standards in the power sector. In this scenario, total energy demand stays broadly stable through to 2035, with limited natural gas growth, a modest 10 20 30 2015202420352050 Oil Natural gas Coal Electricity Renewables Heat Nuclear Other Transport EJ 2015202420352050 Buildings 2015202420352050 Industry 2 500 5 000 7 500 2015202420352050 TWh Power IEA.

Chapter 8 | Regional insights 365 8 decline in oil and a significant reduction in coal use, a continued positive outlook for nuclear, and increasing adoption of renewables, driven in part by the assumed extension of state mandates in the STEPS. Box 8.1 ⊳ Update on electricity supply to power US data centres The IEA published its first report on Energy and AI in April 2025 (IEA, 2025a). It includes detailed analysis of electricity demand for data centres and examines how electricity supply might meet that demand. Policy changes at the federal level since then have changed the outlook for the US electricity sector, and with it the outlook for electricity supply to power data centres. Taking this into account, we have updated our analysis to reflect the changed policy landscape, and in particular to take account of current plans to phase out tax credits for a number of renewable energy technologies, including solar PV and wind power. Yet, there are three key factors that remain largely unchanged: corporate renewable and other low-emissions energy and net zero emission targets, which many technology companies – including the big four – continue to pursue; state\u0002level renewable portfolio standards; and bottlenecks in the gas turbine supply chain. Natural gas was the biggest source for electricity to serve data centres in the United States in 2024, accounting for over 40% of supply. Renewables, predominantly solar PV and wind, contributed one-quarter of supply, while nuclear provided around 20% and coal close to 15%. Since nearly all data centres are connected to the grid, these shares essentially mirror the electricity mix of the states where the US data centres are concentrated. Figure 8.7 ⊳ Electricity generation for data centres in the United States in the CPS, 2020-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Recent policy changes mean that natural gas dominates the electricity supply for US data centres to 2030 and 2035; renewables and nuclear also contribute significantly Note: TWh = terawatt-hour. 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 2020 2024 2030 2035 Other Other renewables Wind Solar PV Nuclear Natural gas Coal TWh IEA. CC BY 4.0. 366 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 In the CPS, electricity generation to supply data centres more than triples from around 200 terawatt-hours (TWh) today to 640 TWh by 2035 (Figure 8.7). Natural gas-fired generation increases the most of any source to meet new data centre demand, rising 260 TWh to 2035, much of it before 2030. This increase reflects continued growth for natural gas and is largely achieved by operating existing, grid-connected gas-fired power plants more often. Some developers also plan to co-locate large-scale data centres with new, dedicated natural gas-fired power generators, although constraints in the gas turbine supply chain may delay some of these projects until after 2030. The second-largest source of additional supply is from wind and solar PV that together increase by approximately 70 TWh by 2035. This is largely due to the growth of wind and solar capacity in states where data centres are located. To meet corporate clean energy targets, some data centre operators are also investing in renewables and signing power purchase agreements for hourly matched renewable electricity. The electricity supplied from other renewable energy sources that can provide baseload electricity also increases by around 13 TWh by 2035. Geothermal, backed by prominent hyper-scalers as a dispatchable source of low-emissions electricity, plays a bigger role, as does hydropower where the focus is on upgrading existing facilities. Nuclear is the third-largest source of additional electricity supply, particularly after 2030, when several hyper-scalers are expected to commission small modular reactors to provide power direct to new data centres. As a result, nuclear generation for data centres rises by about 70 TWh by 2035. US technology companies already have plans to finance more than 25 gigawatts of small modular reactors, although most of this capacity is not expected to materialise until after 2035. By 2035, natural gas is anticipated to provide over half of the electricity required by data centres in the United States, followed by renewables and nuclear, around 20% each, and coal at 7%. These projections differ from those in the base case in the April 2025 Energy and AI report on the level of demand: they add nearly 70 TWh of additional annual electricity generation dedicated to data centres by 2035. They also differ on how demand will be met: the supply mix in our revised analysis shows a significant upward revision for natural gas and a downward revision for wind and solar PV, reflecting the changed policy environment with passage of the OBBBA. 8.2.2 What is next for the US energy powerhouse? The scale of the US economy is reflected in its consumption of energy, with the country ranking first in global terms for both oil and natural gas demand. In 2024, US oil demand accounted for close to 20% of the global total, while natural gas consumption exceeded 940 billion cubic metres (bcm), about 80% more than any other country. The United States ranks third in coal demand. For renewables, the United States ranks second, with major IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 367 8 contributions to supply from bioenergy, wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal. The United States is the second-largest generator of electricity in the world: it produces half as much as China but more than twice as much as India, which ranks third. The United States also operates the world’s largest nuclear fleet, with over 100 gigawatts (GW) in operation today. Figure 8.8 ⊳ Top countries in fuel demand, power and supply, 2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The United States leads the world in oil and natural gas production and in nuclear capacity; it is also a major consumer of a wide variety of types of energy Note: bcm = billion cubic metres; mb/d = million barrels per day; Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; EJ = exajoule; GW = gigawatt; TWh = terawatt-hour. In recent years, the United States has become the leading producer of both oil and natural gas. Its oil production of 20 million barrels per day (mb/d) is nearly double that of the next largest producer, and its natural gas output accounts for one-quarter of the global total, 60% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Natural gas Oil Coal Renewables Nuclear capacity Electricity generation Natural gas Oil Coal United States Other top countries Share of the world Demand Power Supply 942 bcm 280 Mtce 11 EJ 102 GW 4 565 TWh 1 072 bcm 20 mb/d 464 Mtce Russia China India India China China India China France China India Russia Iran Saudi Arabia Russia China India Indonesia 18 mb/d China IEA. CC BY 4.0. 368 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 higher than the second-ranked country (Figure 8.8). These levels of production have turned the United States into a net exporter of oil and gas, a huge turnaround from past trends, allowing the country to play an increasingly influential role in global energy markets and energy security. Looking ahead, the United States is set to maintain its position as a global leader in oil and gas production, while expanding the use of other priority technologies such as nuclear. Against the background of the support for domestic oil and gas production provided by the OBBBA and other new federal policies, oil output rises by around 0.1 mb/d per year to 2035 in the CPS, outpacing domestic demand and increasing net exports by 0.5 mb/d. Natural gas production also expands steadily, exceeding demand growth, boosting net exports by over 130 bcm and cementing the position of the United States as the largest gas exporter globally. Coal production continues to decline from its 2022 peak, although enough is still produced to meet all domestic demand. The United States remains the largest global producer and consumer of oil and natural gas through to 2035 in both the CPS and the STEPS. The OBBBA also spurs the expansion of a number of domestic energy technologies. Nuclear power is poised for renewed growth, supported by continued tax credits, increased financing and the removal or reduction of regulatory barriers. In the CPS, nuclear capacity remains stable to 2030 before increasing by one-third to 2040 and more than 80% by 2050. Despite this growth, China catches up the United States in nuclear capacity around 2030 and takes the lead through to 2050. Renewable energy capacity grows by two-thirds to 2035, with geothermal energy increasing by 75% in the CPS from a small base, supported by tax incentives and accelerated permitting, for its use in both electricity generation and direct heat applications. Biofuels remain part of the energy mix, with continued federal support focused on domestic resources, and more limited incentives for sustainable aviation fuel. The use of biofuels increases by 6% to 2035 in the CPS. There is increasing recognition in the United States that resilient critical mineral supply chains are vital for energy technologies, industrial competitiveness and national security. The country is ramping up efforts to build diversified supply chains through public financing, industrial policy measures and strategic partnerships. The US Department of Energy and the Department of Defense have extended major financial support to domestic projects, including lithium and rare earth processing facilities, through the Defense Production Act and loan programmes. In early 2025, the US Export-Import Bank launched a new financing tool, the Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative, to provide targeted financing for critical mineral projects, and an Executive Order directed the Department of Defense and the US International Development Finance Corporation to establish a dedicated investment fund. Public-private partnerships are also scaling up, exemplified by a transformational deal between MP Materials, a leading rare earth producer in the United States, and the Department of Defense that involves large-scale financing support, long-term offtake and price floor commitments. These moves underscore the US ambition to play a leading role in shaping the future global critical minerals landscape. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 369 8 8.3 Latin America and the Caribbean 8.3.1 Key energy trends The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region has significant untapped energy resource potential ranging from solar and wind to oil, biofuels and critical minerals. Climate resilience is a pressing issue as the region faces ever more extreme weather events and the power outages and other disruptions that accompany them. In November 2025, Brazil hosts COP30 with the aim of accelerating efforts to implement climate pledges. Around 65% of electricity in LAC is from renewables – more than in any other region – and the share of renewables in electricity generation is poised to expand further. In Brazil, the share has already reached nearly 90% thanks in large part to hydropower, while the proportion of electricity generated from wind and solar power in Chile and Uruguay is among the highest in the world. In 2010, around 40% of its capacity additions were renewables; in 2024 this share reached 90%, well above the global average of around 80%. The trend continues in the STEPS, with solar accounting for over 45% of new capacity from 2025 to 2035 (Figure 8.9). As a result, the share of renewables in power generation is around 70% by 2035, while the share of renewables in total energy supply rises from 30% to over 35%. Rapid growth in solar and wind is changing the power sector dynamics, with both Chile and Brazil having to curtail these sources at times in 2024 to balance the power grids. Further investment in high functioning grids is needed to support its evolving power mix. Figure 8.9 ⊳ Total energy demand and electricity generation in Latin America and the Caribbean in the STEPS, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. 370 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Government incentives and competitively priced electric vehicles from China are boosting EV sales particularly in Brazil, Costa Rica, Uruguay and Colombia. Sales more than doubled in Brazil in 2024, with EVs from China accounting for 85% of the total. Chile and Colombia have some of the largest electric bus fleets globally, and close to 8% of buses sold in Mexico in 2024 were electric. In the STEPS, existing policies and industry projects mean that nearly 25% of vehicles sold in the region are electric by 2035. Despite this, oil remains the largest source of energy used in LAC in the STEPS, largely due to the transport sector. The LAC region includes countries that are significant oil and gas exporters. The value of fossil fuel production remains broadly constant in the STEPS, with contrasting underlying trends. Oil production increases in Brazil, Guyana and Argentina, while it falls in Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador. Argentina is the only country to see significant growth in natural gas production by 2035. Coal production decreases by around 65% by 2035, mostly due to lower output in Colombia. The LAC region includes countries that are important producers and exporters of critical minerals, accounting for around one-third of the global market in 2024. Chile is the world's largest producer of copper and Peru is the third-largest. The region also includes the lithium triangle of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. Argentina doubled its lithium production from 2022 to 2024. LAC is rich in other critical minerals too, including rare earths and nickel. Revenue from production of critical minerals rises in the STEPS (Figure 8.10). Expanding the capacity to process and refine extracted ores could boost local economies and help diversify global supply chains.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 371 8 8.3.2 Prospects for bioenergy in Latin America and the Caribbean The LAC region is a leader in bioenergy, which provided around one-fifth of its energy demand in 2024. Nearly 85% was from modern bioenergy. Solid modern bioenergy is its leading source of bioenergy, and is mostly used for light industry manufacturing activities such as food production. Robust bioenergy sustainability standards have an important part to play to limit the extent and impact of land-use change and to minimise methane emissions. Not all the bioenergy used in the region is modern. Despite progress in some countries, there are still nearly 70 million people in the region that rely on the traditional use of biomass for cooking and heating. About one-quarter of global liquid biofuels were produced in the LAC in 2024. Biofuels account for over 10% of energy consumption in transport, compared to a global average below 5%. In response to the 1973 oil crisis, Brazil introduced the Pró-Álcool programme to produce bioethanol to reduce reliance on gasoline imports and bolster domestic supply security. Around 85% of the car fleet in Brazil today consists of flex fuel vehicles that can operate with high levels of ethanol blending: Brazil is the largest producer and consumer of biofuels in the region, and the second-largest producer of liquid biofuels worldwide. Argentina and Colombia are emerging as prominent suppliers. In the STEPS, modern bioenergy use increases by around 30% by 2035, helping to meet a growing share of energy demand (Figure 8.11). Biofuel mandates in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia increase the share of modern bioenergy in their overall energy supply mixes: use of liquid biofuels ramps up significantly, and in relative terms, so does the use of biogases. Figure 8.11 ⊳ Modern bioenergy use by type and country in Latin America and the Caribbean in the STEPS, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. 372 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 There is also scope to ramp up biogas production. Brazil has the largest potential for biogas supply in the world, but its annual production remains relatively small, around 0.7 billion cubic metres of natural gas equivalent (bcme). Most of its biogas production is from landfill sites, but there is potential to make use of vinasse, which is a by-product from the ethanol industry, and to step up use of sustainable feedstocks such as crop residues and animal manure that remain largely untapped (Figure 8.12).The quota obligations in the new Fuel of the Future law in Brazil are likely to stimulate growth in biogas production. In addition to its energy value, biogas production offers several co-benefits. Digestate, a nutrient-rich by-product of biogas production, can be used as a fertiliser, while upgrading biogas to biomethane produces a pure stream of biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) which can be captured and stored, or used in industry such as food and beverage production. Figure 8.12 ⊳ Sustainable feedstock potential and biogas production by source and country in LAC in the STEPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Biogas production is set to significantly increase, yet much feedstock potential remains untapped in 2035 Note: bcme = billion cubic metres of natural gas equivalent; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; Other LAC = Other countries in LAC. The average cost of producing biomethane in the region is around USD 23 per gigajoule (GJ), which is somewhat higher than end-user prices for natural gas in most LAC countries. Incentives for biomethane production could create new jobs, improve waste management and reduce the need to import natural gas. Improving access to infrastructure such as natural gas networks could help increase demand by broadening the potential market for biomethane. In Brazil, the Special Incentive Regime for Infrastructure Development already includes biomethane within the types of projects eligible for tax exemptions for materials and equipment. 25 50 75 100 125 Other LAC Colombia Mexico Argentina Brazil Crop residues Manure Woody biomass Biowaste Sustainable feedstock potential for biogas bcme 1 2 2024 2035 bcme Biogas production IEA.

Chapter 8 | Regional insights 373 8 8.4 European Union 8.4.1 Key energy trends The European Union has ambitious energy and climate targets for 2030 which include a net reduction of 55% in GHG emissions, deployment of 600 GW of new solar PV, and a reduction in total final consumption of 11.7% compared with the levels in the European Commission EU Reference Scenario 2020. These targets aim to meet EU climate goals as well as to improve energy security and competitiveness by reducing dependence on expensive imported fossil fuels. The downside risks of such dependence were underscored in the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine when natural gas pipeline deliveries from Russia were cut, sparking an energy crisis. Despite government support for energy bills waning, average residential energy prices in the European Union have fallen slightly since the crisis, but they remain over 20% above their 2010-2019 average. Figure 8.13 ⊳ Energy demand by source in the STEPS and with climate pledges in the European Union, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Although fossil fuels decline in the STEPS, faster gains in efficiency and renewables deployment are needed to meet climate pledges Notes: EJ = exajoule; NG = Natural gas. Other includes geothermal, marine and solar thermal. The climate pledges pathway outlines a trajectory towards the European Union achieving its long-term climate goals. EU plans for a clean energy transition are predicated on developing cost-competitive sources of clean energy that reduce the share of fossil fuels in total final consumption. The power sector makes the biggest contribution to this goal as the share of renewables in the generation mix rises, with coal demand in 2035 falling to nearly one-ninth of today’s level in the STEPS, and natural gas demand falling by over 40 bcm. Gas demand declines by 14% by 2035 in the buildings sector as more heat pumps are installed, and by 12% in the industry sector as efficiency improves. Oil demand declines as well, with the uptake of EVs cutting 20 40 60 80 2010 2024 Coal Oil NG Nuclear Solar PV Bioenergy and waste Wind Hydro Other EJ Historical STEPS Climate pledges 2025 2035 2025 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 374 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 demand by close to 2 mbd/year in the STEPS by 2035. Meeting the EU long-term climate pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 requires a further 25% reduction in the use of fossil fuels from the level projected in the STEPS in 2035 (Figure 8.13). The European Union decarbonisation trajectory relies heavily on its electricity system. Its system is interconnected and strong, but has faced some recent setbacks, including a blackout on the Iberian Peninsula (Box 8.2). The share of fossil fuels in generation dropped below 30% in 2024, below the combined share of solar PV and wind, and there has been a uptick in support for nuclear power in several EU member states: Belgium voted to keep its reactors online and to allow the construction of new ones; France plans to provide a loan to cover at least half of the construction costs for six nuclear reactors; and Italy announced plans to consider the reintroduction of nuclear power. In the STEPS, electricity generation increases by 40% and its share of final consumption by nine percentage points from the current level by 2035. Energy storage, market reform and grid expansion are needed to support the transition in the EU electricity sector. In the STEPS, grid investment almost doubles by 2035 compared to today. These investments have the potential to accelerate renewables integration and affordability for end-users, though consumersface very different electricity prices, depending on their country. For example, the average German household paid almost four-times higher electricity prices than the average Hungarian household in the second-half of 2024, driven by different market fundamentals, policies and subsidy levels. The new EU NDC targets a cut of 66.25-72.5% in GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2035, in line with the goal of a 90% reduction below 1990 levels by 2040, agreed by EU Environment Ministers in November 2025. In addition to measures to increase the electrification of end\u0002uses, boost the share of low-emissions fuels in the power sector and improve efficiency, deep decarbonisation also requires making meaningful inroads into hard-to-abate sectors such as energy-intensive industry. Success will depend on the effectiveness of emerging strategies: for instance, in 2025 the European Union announced an intention to mobilise EUR 100 billion (USD 108 billion) to support industry decarbonisation as part of its Clean Industrial Deal. This funding can be used to support novel mechanisms, like the planned EUR 1 billion (USD 1.1 billion) EU-wide fixed premium auction related to decarbonising industrial process heat and is in addition to funding from individual member states, like the EUR 4 billion (USD 4.3 billion) allocated to carbon contracts for difference in Germany. Box 8.2 ⊳ Iberian blackout: lessons learned On 28 April 2025, the Iberian Peninsula suffered a widespread blackout that interrupted electricity supply across Spain, Portugal and parts of southern France, affecting over 50 million people. According to the ENTSO-E factual report, the event was triggered by a rapid sequence of technical failures (ENTSO-E, 2025). In the minutes before the blackout, the electricity system became unstable, with unusual swings in voltage and power flows. This instability was followed by a sharp rise in voltage as generators that had been absorbing reactive power were erroneously shut down by protection systems, even though voltage levels had not yet exceeded thresholds defined by regulation. As more plants disconnected, the voltage rose further, leading to a cascade of additional IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 375 8 shutdowns. Hundreds of megawatts (MW) of smaller, distributed sources switched off unexpectedly, making it even more difficult for system operators to respond. Ultimately, the Iberian system was disconnected from the rest of Europe, and automatic safety systems could not prevent a complete collapse. Following the outage, the Spanish and Portuguese system operators, working with neighbouring system operators, moved to restore supply using black-start hydropower, thermal plants and imports from France. By the early morning of 29 April, all transmission substations were energised, and nearly all demand was met. The incident demonstrates that electricity security in modern power systems depends not only on generation but also on the quality of grid operation and the behaviour of all connected assets. This highlights the need for enforceable rules that require all generators to support the system during emergencies and to disconnect only if clearly defined thresholds are breached. Preparedness remains essential. The rapid restoration of power in the Iberian Peninsula was made possible by strong interconnections with neighbouring countries, robust emergency protocols and available black-start capability. Maintaining and strengthening these capabilities is crucial. The heightened international attention brought by the blackout provides an opportunity to revisit some common elements of electricity security and resilience as power systems evolve. While electricity systems and market structures differ from country to country, IEA analysis has identified four critical pillars that are necessary in every case (IEA, 2025b). First, robust grid infrastructure is vital, including strong networks and regional interconnections, as it provides the backbone for secure operations. Second, power system flexibility is essential to balance supply and demand, which includes demand-side response, storage and the maintenance of dispatchable generation, as well as measures to ensure that markets appropriately value these services. Third, technical solutions, such as synchronous condensers or batteries equipped with grid-forming inverters, are needed to support system stability as the generation mix evolves. Forth, it is crucial to adapt operational frameworks as power systems transform by updating grid codes, reserve requirements, balancing mechanisms and regulatory structures to keep pace with new challenges and technologies. 8.4.2 How can industrial heat pumps deliver competitiveness and decarbonisation? Improving competitiveness is central to EU economic growth. Non-energy-intensive industries play an important role: while they consume 30% of energy in industry, they account for around 80% of the value it adds to the economy. Electrification in non-energy\u0002intensive industries in the European Union has flatlined since 2015 at similar levels to the United States, and at much lower levels than major industrial hubs in Asia (Figure 8.14). Industrial heat pumps (IHPs) are a key technology for electrification of low and medium temperature processes: they use one-third to one-fifth of the energy of conventional boilers and do not rely directly on fossil fuels. Using IHPs for electrification is an effective way to IEA. CC BY 4.0. 376 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 decarbonise, improve competitiveness, and reduce import dependence (the region imports over 90% of its oil and almost 85% of its natural gas). The EU Industrial Clean Deal recognises the importance of electrification, aiming to raise the economy-wide electrification rate to 32% by 2030. Figure 8.14 ⊳ Electrification and end-user prices in non-energy-intensive industry in selected regions in the STEPS, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Despite importing most of its fossil fuels, the EU has seen the share of electrification in non\u0002energy-intensive industries flatline; to meet climate pledges, this share needs to increase Notes: USD/GJ = US dollar per gigajoule. The EU climate pledges pathway outlines a trajectory towards the European Union achieving its long-term climate goals. Low electricity prices help drive electrification, but current prices are both volatile and high by historical standards. Natural gas set the day-ahead wholesale electricity price around 60% of the time, despite generating only 20% of electricity in 2022 (European Commission, 2024). Moreover, electricity taxes in most EU member states are high relative to gas and to other regions. Despite these hurdles, IHPs are competitive with gas based on current EU average industry end-use prices; regional price variation makes the advantage stronger in some member states than others (Figure 8.15). The superior efficiency of IHPs relative to gas boilers translates into lower operating costs which can mean lower lifetime costs, even though IHPs involve higher upfront capital expenditure. Industrial consumers with IHPs can reduce exposure to price volatility by using a power purchase agreement or reduce costs by curtailing heat production when prices are high, provided that suitable demand-side flexibility mechanisms are in place. Electric boilers, which are less efficient than IHPs, could also be competitive if used flexibly because they require comparatively little upfront capital spending. Flexibility could be achieved through the use of thermal storage or by electrifying only part of a fleet of gas boilers, which could also reduce grid connection costs by lowering the required connection capacity.

Figure 8.15 ⊳ Competitiveness of electrification routes compared to average end-user prices for industrial consumers in the Europe Union IEA. CC BY 4.0. Since 2022, electricity has been an economical source of heat for industry compared to gas, yet heat pump installation remains at a low level Notes: MBtu = million British thermal unit; MWh = megawatt-hours; PPA = power purchase agreement; Q4 = fourth quarter. PPA price shown reflects the EU-wide average of deals, not including transmission or distribution charges. The coefficient of performance for the industrial heat pump is 3.5. Demand flexibility of 20% requires curtailing electric heating during the 20% of hours with the highest power price. Despite their cost effectiveness in recent years, IHPs have made limited progress. High initial capital outlays which take a long time to recoup are a major barrier. IHP installation may also require facilities to reconfigure service utilities, further increasing cost and complexity. Policy can help ameliorate these challenges: the carbon contracts for difference auction by the German government in 2024 was mainly won by electrification projects, and industrial electricity prices may fall further there under a plan to subsidise electricity bills for industry. There are also examples from further afield that could serve as a blueprint for the European Union. In New Zealand, where policy has underpinned growth in IHPs, about one-quarter of the potential has been captured: assistance was provided to help with upfront costs, and a support programme addressed concerns about engineering expertise. Spot prices for natural gas are not the only factor affecting electrification: energy security plays a key role. Motivated by energy security considerations as well climate goals, the European Union has a target for renewables to provide at least 42.5% of the energy mix by 2030, and in tandem its action plan for grids aimsto add 64 GW of cross-border transmission between 2025 and 2030. These plans indicate a strong commitment to electricity security, and are likely to boost electrification, including the adoption of IHPs. 10 20 30 40 0 50 100 150 200 250 Electricity price (USD/MWh) Gas price (USD/MBtu) 2020 2022 2024 2035 STEPS Industrial heat pump and electric boiler competitive Industrial heat pump competitive Solar PPA Q4 2024 Wind PPA Q4 2024 2024 - 20% Demand flexibility IEA.

Over the last decade financing fell for export-oriented oil and gas projects, but investment rebounded since 2021, led by increases in spending on domestic energy infrastructure, especially in the power sector. This trend continues in the STEPS, with total energy investment by 2035 returning close to highs last seen in 2015 (Figure 8.16). However, investment levels in the STEPS still fall short of meeting basic energy needs. Chapter 6 explores what it would take to achieve universal access to modern energy in Africa by 2040, including the implications for investment. Figure 8.16 ⊳ Energy investment by target area in Africa, 2015-2024, and in the STEPS to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy investment fell after 2015 as oil and gas projects slowed, though it has rebound since 2021with domestic energy developments and new oil and gas projects Note: MER = market exchange rate. Efforts to progress modern energy access are gaining renewed momentum. The majority of Africans without access live in countries that have introduced new policies since 2024. Accordingly, the number of people gaining access to clean cooking by 2035 accelerates to 24 million per year in the STEPS, and begins to outpace population growth by 2030. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plays the biggest role to extend access for cooking, with an increase in demand of 150 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) by 2035. Around 20 million people per year gain access to electricity to 2035 in the STEPS – a rate of progress 25% higher than in the 2010s. 40 80 120 160 2015 2018 2021 2024 Annual energy investment Billion USD (2024, MER) Average annual investment 2025 -2035 2036 -2050 Energy efficiency and end-use electrification Low-emissions technologies Export-oriented fuel supply Domestic coal Domestic oil Domestic gas Fossil fuel power IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 379 8 Meeting rising electricity demand requires a major expansion of power systems in Africa. An average of 24 GW of new capacity is added each year to 2035 in the STEPS, which is double the rate seen over the past decade. More than 70% of these additions are renewables, with solar PV alone accounting for half. Solar PV is the cheapest new source of electricity in most African countries, and its expansion is further aided by a sharp increase in solar panel imports from China as excess PV panel manufacturers cultivate new markets. Solar PV overtakes hydropower as the second-largest electricity source by 2035 (Figure 8.17). Natural gas remains the largest source of electricity, helping to support grid reliability in sub-Saharan Africa. Coal continues to contribute to the generation mix, and nuclear power development gains momentum. In Egypt, the El Dabaa plant – North Africa’s first nuclear power facility – is expected to reach full capacity by 2030. Many African countries have plans to diversify their generation mix, and these have been given added impetus by the recent crippling hydropower shortages. Grid networks expand in the STEPS, with an average of 190 000 kilometres (km) added each year to 2035, a 40% increase from the current level. Figure 8.17 ⊳ Total energy demand and electricity generation by source in Africa in the STEPS, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy demand rises and access to modern energy improves; electricity generation accelerates with recent positive trends in investment, with solar PV in the lead Notes: EJ = exajoule; TWh = terawatt-hour. Other includes geothermal and solar thermal. Africa sees an uptick in oil and gas investment activity in the STEPS. Incumbent oil producers such as Libya, Algeria and Nigeria see production remain broadly flat against a backdrop of higher OPEC+ production allowances; new exporters such as Uganda and Senegal are coming online; and Namibia begins adding barrels in the mid-2030s. The net result is that oil production in Africa remains broadly stable to 2035, accounting for 7-8% of the global total. Meanwhile natural gas production rises from 240 bcm in 2024 to around 260 bcm by 2035, when it accounts for over 5% of the global total.

These minerals are critically important for a variety of energy technologies and for other industries. This geological wealth offers a path for African countries to move beyond their historical role as exporters of raw materials. Today, however, most of the mineral resources are exported directly as ore or in semi\u0002processed forms to be refined overseas. For instance, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounted for two-thirds of global mined production of cobalt in 2024, but nearly all its output is exported with minimal processing: most of it goes to China, where it is refined into battery-grade material. This pattern is replicated across many other minerals, with few exceptions. Some countries have decided to encourage domestic value added by following the example of Indonesia and prohibiting the export of unprocessed ores. For example, Zimbabwe introduced tighter controls on lithium extraction and exports in 2023, and in May 2025 Gabon announced its intention to ban the export of raw manganese ore from January 2029. Whatever the policy intention, the effectiveness of export bans is highly contingent on specific national and market conditions, and few countries have the market power to make this an effective strategy. Moving successfully into downstream activities to increase the economic value of mineral resource endowments depends on the development of cost-effective local processing capabilities. Moving from raw ore to processed outputs captures a large part of the value added in the mineral supply chain, and stepping up the value chain in this way can be a catalyst for a virtuous cycle of industrialisation that results in higher value exports, additional skilled employment and lasting economic resilience. A domestic mineral processing industry can also stimulate investment in local energy infrastructure to meet the demand it creates. If the enabling factors are favourable and policy and investment frameworks are in place, Africa could play a key role in the global supply of concentrates and refined minerals. To demonstrate this potential, we considered a representative portfolio of Africa’s resource endowments: copper, cobalt, graphite, nickel, manganese and phosphate. The DRC and Zambia hold substantial copper and cobalt resources: refined copper is an essential component for many energy technologies and the broader economy, while battery-grade cobalt is used in the cathodes of nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) type lithium-ion batteries. NMC batteries also require refined manganese and nickel, and these metals are produced in South Africa, Gabon and Madagascar. Morocco could leverage its vast phosphate reserves to expand production of purified phosphoric acid, which is a key input for lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Similarly, the graphite mined in Mozambique and Madagascar could be upgraded into spherical graphite, the processed anode material required for nearly all types of lithium-ion batteries. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 381 8 We examined plausible pathways to increase domestic refining of the various minerals. Some 60% of its mined copper is already refined in Africa, which produced 9% of global refined copper output in 2024, and this could be increased to 80% by 2040 (Figure 8.18). Similarly, about 55% of its nickel production is refined in Africa today, though the overall volume remains small. This could rise to over 65% in 2040, boosting its market value by around 10% even as mine output remains stable. In the case of cobalt, refining in Africa could increase from 3% of mined output today to 13% in 2040, increasing refined output by 2.5-times to 16 thousand tonnes (kt). Battery-grade graphite production could rise from today’s very low levels to reach 130 kt in 2040. Figure 8.18 ⊳ Market value of selected minerals and share of minerals refined in Africa in 2024 and potential in 2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. If domestic refining is strategically scaled up, the combined market value of key minerals could increase by three-quarters between today and 2040 to reach USD 120 billion Notes: Values in 2024 US dollars (USD). Percentage refined indicates volume share of mine output that is refined in Africa. Refined phosphate expressed in P2O5 content. Graphite refers to battery-grade spherical graphite. At current price levels, the result would be to increase the total market value of these minerals by nearly three-quarters from around USD 70 billion today to USD 120 billion in 2040. This takes account of projected changes in mined output, which declines in some cases, as well as the proportion of ore that is already refined in Africa. Refined phosphate could account for an additional USD 39 billion of value in 2040 compared to 2024. Refined cobalt could increase in value by more than USD 300 million, though this would not fully offset the decrease in mined production.

CC BY 4.0. 382 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.6 Middle East 8.6.1 Key energy trends The Middle East is a major producer and consumer of energy. It contains five of the world’s top-ten oil producing countries, i.e. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, and three of the top-ten natural gas producers, i.e. Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia (Figure 8.19). Oil production by OPEC+ countries, seven of which are in the Middle East, has increased since the start of 2025 as the bloc unwinds production cuts agreed in 2023. Those Middle East countries that are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council have high per capita energy consumption and income levels: they account for nearly 60% of the region’s GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms and over half of energy demand while making up just over a fifth of the regional population. Parts of the Middle East face geopolitical instability and conflict, and this inevitably affects their energy and economic outlook. Figure 8.19 ⊳ Oil and natural gas relative to global production and energy demand by source in the Middle East in the STEPS, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Oil and gas production in the Middle East account for a significant share of total global hydrocarbon output, and these sources also meet nearly all energy demand in the region Notes: EJ = exajoule. Other energy demand includes bioenergy and waste, coal, solar thermal, hydro and wind. Natural gas and oil meet 56% and 41% of the region’s energy demand respectively, compared to global averages of 23% and 30%. The shares vary by country: for example, over 70% of energy demand in Iran is met by gas, and over 90% in Qatar, whereas over 80% of energy demand in both Yemen and Lebanon is met by oil. Per capita energy demand in the region varies widely among countries, but for the region as a whole it is more than twice the average of emerging market and developing economies. Several factors contribute to the high level of energy demand.

At 143 cars per 1 000 people, the ownership rate is about 45% higher than the average of emerging market and developing economies, reflecting relatively high average incomes in some countries. Space cooling needs are substantial because of the hot climate. In addition, most countries in the region face water stress or scarcity and turn to desalination where it is financially feasible. Figure 8.20 ⊳ Electricity demand by end-use and generation by source in the Middle East in the STEPS, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The electricity outlook shows a decline in the share of oil in generation and a rise in demand driven in large part by space cooling, appliances and desalination Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour. The difference between generation and demand reflects transmission and distribution losses, own use in the power sector and net imports. Other in demand includes transport and hydrogen production. Other in electricity generation includes bioenergy, coal and hydropower. Energy demand in the Middle East increased at an annual rate of 2.6% between 2010 and 2024. This slows to an annual average of 1.8% to 2035 in the STEPS, and to 2.4% in the CPS. Natural gas demand rises 30% by 2035 in the STEPS, while oil demand declines marginally. Electricity consumption rises faster than overall energy demand in both scenarios (IEA, 2025d). Today, 64% of electricity used in the Middle East is consumed in commercial and residential buildings, and 4% in desalination. Around 80% of the world’s thermal desalination plants, i.e. those using oil and gas, are in the Middle East, but there has been a shift in recent years towards more efficient electrified desalination technologies, notably reverse osmosis. Electricity demand for desalination increases by more than a factor of 2.5 in the STEPS by 2035. Despite this rapid increase in energy demand from desalination, space cooling is the largest end-use driver of electricity demand growth to 2035 (Figure 8.20). Although their share of the market is still very small, EVs are gaining ground in parts of the region. In Jordan, for example, EVs accounted for over 50% of new passenger car sales in 2024. 600 1 200 1 800 2 400 2010 2024 Space cooling Appliances Desalination Other buildings Industry Other Electricity demand by end-use TWh 2035 2010 2024 Oil Natural gas Nuclear Solar PV Wind Other Electricity generation by source 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 384 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.6.2 Synergies between increasing cooling demand and renewables uptake The Middle East is among the hottest regions in the world, with temperatures regularly exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (°C) in the summer. As temperatures rise further, cooling degree days – a measure of cooling needs - are projected to increase by 10% by 2035. Electricity demand for space cooling nearly doubled between 2010 and 2024, from 166 TWh to over 300 TWh today: cooling now accounts for about a quarter of overall electricity demand in the region. Electricity consumption patterns are strongly influenced by the weather, especially in the summer season. When temperatures are at their highest, cooling can be responsible for nearly 50% of the peak electricity load. Figure 8.21 ⊳ Annual electricity load curve and peak cooling demand by driver in the Middle East in the STEPS, 2024-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Space cooling drives variations in electricity demand over the year and accounts for a large share of peak demand Notes: GW = gigawatt; AC = air conditioning. Insulation includes all measures to improve the energy performance of the building envelope. Hourly demand profiles reflect the reduction in demand during Ramadan, which was in March-April in 2024 and is scheduled for November in 2035. Space cooling demand increases by a further 140 TWh by 2035 in the STEPS and by nearly 160 TWh in the CPS. This growth is driven by an increase in floorspace, rising air conditioner ownership and higher temperatures, and tempered by efficiency improvements in air conditioners and better insulation (Figure 8.21). Several countries in the Middle East have policies to moderate cooling demand: most countries in the region have minimum energy performance standards for air conditioners, and countries including Jordan and Lebanon are developing national cooling action plans. In the United Arab Emirates, regulations limit the minimum temperature setting for air conditioners to 20 °C. 100 200 300 400 Jan Jul 2024 2035 Hourly electricity demand over the year GW Dec 50 100 150 200 2024 2035 Floorspace AC ownership Insulation AC efficiency Peak cooling demand by driver Climate IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 385 8 Peak electricity demand in the Middle East rises by around 40% in the STEPS by 2035 compared to today, underscoring the importance of system adequacy for electricity security and the need for additional investment. Today, energy investment in the Middle East amounts to 6% of GDP, which is twice the global average. Around 78% of investment is expected to go to fossil fuels in 2025, compared to a global average of 35%. This share falls to 66% by 2035 in the STEPS as investment in grids, storage and low-emissions electricity increase. Figure 8.22 ⊳ Average summer daily electricity consumption with and without space cooling flexibility in the Middle East in the STEPS, 2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Cooling flexibility can be harnessed to align demand with renewables energy generation Notes: GW = gigawatt; h = hours. Residual load is the difference between electricity demand and renewables generation. Space cooling drives the peak electricity demand growth in the Middle East, yet it also presents an opportunity to support the integration of renewables power generation. The ability to shift cooling loads over time can be used to decrease the daily variation in residual load, defined as total electricity demand minus renewable generation. Reducing the magnitude of these variations is crucial to lower operational stress on dispatchable power sources required to balance the networks. Depending on the thermal inertia1 of buildings, cooling demand loads can be shifted by a period of between a few dozen minutes to several hours, or even more in combination with thermal storage systems, such as water tanks. This can shift electricity consumption closer to midday, thereby enabling electricity systems to benefit from peak solar PV generation and avoid curtailment (Figure 8.22). By 2035, over 15% of electricity in the Middle East comes from solar PV in the STEPS, and 5% from other renewable sources including wind. 1 How quickly a building heats up or cools down in response to outdoor temperature changes. 100 200 300 400 0h 12h Cooling Other end uses Total Solar and wind Residual load Without cooling flexibility GW 24h 0h 12h With cooling flexibility 24h Shifted cooling consumption IEA. CC BY 4.0. 386 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.7 Eurasia 8.7.1 Key energy trends Eurasia is both a major consumer and producer of fossil fuels. In 2024, fossil fuels met 90% of energy demand in the region, the second-highest regional average after the Middle East. Eurasia is also a large net exporter of fossil fuels, selling around 200 bcm of natural gas in 2024, along with 7 mb/d of oil and 130 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) of coal. Russia accounts for around 70% of its oil and gas exports, although these have been significantly affected by unilateral cuts to supply as well as sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine: in 2024, Russian natural gas exports were 45% below their pre-war level of 250 bcm. Several announcements were made by Caspian and Central Asian countries during the COP29 in Baku, including commitments to increase support for renewables and to improve infrastructure links. An example is the Trans-Caspian Green Energy Corridor that was the subject of a Strategic Partnership Agreement signed by Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to integrate their power grids and export renewable energy. However, change in the energy sector has been slow in most cases. Ageing building stock and industrial facilities, undermaintained pipelines that transport fuel over large distances, and a cold climate mean that the regional energy intensity of GDP is 40% higher than the global average. This inefficiency translates into high energy costs, heavy environmental burdens and increased vulnerability to supply disruptions. Ukraine – part of the Europe grouping in our modelling – has historically had strong ties with the Eurasian energy space. However, together with Moldova, it now has its sights set firmly on integration with the broader European energy system. Ukraine faces an especially daunting set of energy challenges, with Russia systematically targeting its energy assets during the war. Ukraine is now exploring a shift towards a more decentralised power system. This is being driven in the first instance by security considerations, but it could become the blueprint for a very different configuration of energy infrastructure in the longer term. Natural gas is the largest contributor to the energy mix in the region and is emblematic of some of its dilemmas. Gas can be an enabler of change in many circumstances: it can, for example, replace fuels with higher emissions intensities and provide system flexibility that helps integrate new sources of low-emissions power. However, the gas sector in many parts of Eurasia is not playing this role: infrastructure is generally in poor condition, prices are often subsidised in ways that encourage wasteful consumption and undercut the competitiveness of alternatives, and high levels of methane leaks compromise the environmental case for gas use. Moreover, with few exceptions, gas resources in the region typically need long-distance pipelines to reach export markets, and this can put them at a disadvantage at a time when consumers appear to prefer the optionality and flexibility of LNG. In the STEPS, total energy demand growth in Eurasia averages 0.2% per year through to 2050, among the lowest rate of growth in emerging market and developing countries. It is marginally higher in the CPS, but the overall amount of growth over the entire projection IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 387 8 period, around 4 EJ, is still equivalent to just four years of average demand growth in Southeast Asia in the same scenario. The energy mix is projected to remain static in both scenarios. Fossil fuels currently account for 90% of the energy mix in Eurasia and remains around that level in both scenarios by 2050 (Figure 8.23). Oil demand rises 0.5 mb/d by 2035 in the STEPS as a result of growth in the transport and industry sectors. Natural gas demand increases by 30 bcm over the same period: this mostly reflects increased demand in power and industry. More than half of the increase in electricity consumption in the STEPS to 2035 is met by natural gas. Renewables capacity nearly doubles between 2024 and 2050, which is the lowest regional rate of growth in the STEPS. Hydropower remains the dominant source of renewables electricity in 2050. Figure 8.23 ⊳ Energy demand by source and scenario in Eurasia, 2010-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Energy supply balance in Eurasia is similar in both scenarios, with natural gas dominating the energy mix Note: EJ = exajoule. Although the pace of change in Eurasia is slow, there are countries that have moved or are moving to diversify their energy and electricity mix. Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Georgia are large and established producers of hydropower. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are expanding their use of renewables, with the focus mainly on solar PV but also wind. Following its hosting of the COP29, Azerbaijan is seeking to step up investment in low-emissions technologies, and it aims to increase the share of renewables in installed capacity to 30% by 2030. Nuclear energy also plays an important and growing role in many countries in Eurasia. Russia is a leading exporter of nuclear technology, and Rosatom is looking to expand co-operation in this area with countries in Central Asia. Kazakhstan is also the largest global producer of uranium, with a market share of around 40%. 10 20 30 40 50 2010 2024 2050 Oil Coal Natural gas Nuclear Renewables Other EJ 2024 2050 STEPS CPS IEA. CC BY 4.0. 388 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.7.2 Prospects for Russian natural gas exports Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine threw its natural gas export strategy into disarray. Before the invasion, the official expectation was for steady growth in exports, with the established European market being supplemented over time by more diversified flows of LNG and pipeline gas, mainly to China and other destinations in Asia. Its previous Energy Strategy foresaw that Russia would be exporting more than 300 bcm of gas by 2024. The actual figure for 2024 is estimated to be less than 160 bcm, and the push for new markets has become a strategic necessity for Russia in light of the huge drop in volumes sent to Europe. The new Russian Energy Strategy, adopted in 2025, is less ambitious than the previous one, but is nonetheless considerably more bullish than our projections. It foresees exports of between 320-375 bcm by the mid-2030s, compared to around 150 bcm in the STEPS (Figure 8.24). Figure 8.24 ⊳ Natural gas pipeline and LNG exports from Russia by scenario relative to the 2025 Energy Strategy targets, 2024, 2030 and 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Russia struggles to find export outlets for natural gas, with both pipeline and LNG trade through to 2050 well below government targets Note: bcm = billion cubic metres. There are four main avenues for Russian gas export: pipeline exports to Europe, China and Central Asia; and exports of LNG. Each of these faces market and political uncertainties. Russian exports of gas to Europe consist mainly of deliveries to the European Union, Türkiye, Belarus, Moldova and the Balkan countries. In the STEPS, exports to Türkiye remain above 20 bcm, and volumes to other non-EU markets remain flat, but deliveries to the European Union fall to less than 10 bcm by 2030 as the Council adopted measures to phase out Russian LNG imports by 2027.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 389 8 anticipate Russian gas returning to Europe at scale, especially given a relatively comfortable global supply balance in the second half of the 2020s. The loss of the European market has led Russia to look elsewhere for customers, including countries in Central Asia that already have pipeline connections. Exports to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have picked up, and a 15- year deal was recently concluded with the smaller Central Asian market of Kyrgyzstan. Consumption of Russian gas in Central Asia is not projected to exceed 10-20 bcm per year, but Central Asia could also act as a conduit for Russian exports to Iran and potentially also to China, although the volumes are not projected to be high. Russian pipeline gas exports to China along the Power of Siberia-1 route reached their envisaged capacity of 38 bcm/year in 2025, and recent discussions have explored the possibility of increasing throughput capacity up to 44 bcm/year. A contract for an extra 10 bcm/year to bring gas from Sakhalin to Northeast China was signed in 2022, the so-called Far Eastern route, and there are prospects for a marginal increase in capacity on this line. Deliveries are scheduled from 2027, but they could slip by a few years. A larger uncertainty relates to the negotiations on an additional large-scale pipeline, Power of Siberia-2, which would bring up to 50 bcm/year of gas from the main resource base in Western Siberia to China. This pipeline is assumed to go ahead in the CPS but not in the STEPS: the Chinese market already looks well supplied without it in this scenario. But this could change if the politics align, or if Russia is ready to cede ground in price negotiations. If it goes ahead in the STEPS and comes into operation in the early 2030s, it would prolong the period of wellsupplied global gas markets and undercut the commercial rationale for further expansion of LNG export projects, including those planned in Russia. The new Russian Energy Strategy has LNG exports reaching 142 bcm by 2030, up by 100 bcm from today. Achieving this in practice will be extremely challenging; this target is considerably higher than the volumes reached in both the CPS and STEPS. Hurdles include the sanctions that limit access to western LNG technologies, finance and markets, and a shortage of LNG tankers that can operate in ice-bound Arctic waters. Russia is looking to relieve the latter constraint through domestically produced technologies and tankers, but these will take time to develop to the required performance standards. Even if these hurdles can be overcome, there are additional commercial obstacles in a fiercely competitive market, given that the second-half of this decade will see unprecedented growth in export capacity in other countries, led by the United States and Qatar. Overall, our analysis suggests that Russia faces an uphill struggle to re-establish its pre\u0002eminence among global gas exporters, despite very competitive upstream costs. Russia’s share of internationally traded gas, which stood at nearly 25% in 2021 before the invasion of Ukraine, never approaches these levels again in any scenario, and falls to 10 % by 2035 in the STEPS. This has implications for gas revenues, which decline from an average of USD 120 billion per year in the 2010s to USD 28 billion per year in the STEPS in the 2030s, and for Russia’s influence as a global energy player. The downside risks for Russian gas outlook intensify in scenarios that see accelerated action to bring down emissions. IEA.

China is set to graduate to high income status in 2025. Its economic growth thus far has been energy intensive: its GDP per capita is 10% above the world average, but its per capita energy consumption is 50% above. In this Outlook, GDP grows 3.5% per year to 2035. Output levels of established industries like steel and cement have peaked and continue to decline in our projections: other energy-intensive industry products such as chemicals, petrochemicals and non-ferrous metals rise, but GDP is increasingly driven by services and high value-added manufacturing. This structural trend, alongside continued efficiency and electrification, leads to a peak and plateau in energy consumption in China (Figure 8.25). This marks an important trend break after years of rapid growth. Figure 8.25 ⊳ Energy demand by source and final consumption by sector in China in the STEPS, 2010-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. After years of rapid growth, energy consumption is set to peak and plateau in the next few years, driven by structural economic change, electrification and efficiency Note: EJ = exajoule; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; EI industries = energy-intensive industries. The structure of energy supply and consumption in China sees substantial shifts by 2035 in the STEPS. It already has one of the highest shares of electricity in final consumption in the world, and this rises from its current level of 27% to 35% by 2035. China adds on average 460 GW of wind and solar PV per year in the decade to 2035. When other renewables and nuclear are added in, low-emissions sources expand in total by around 600 TWh per year. By 2035, China generates over 10 000 TWh of low-emissions electricity, and its total energy supply from renewables and nuclear is 10% larger than supply from oil and natural gas combined. 70 140 2010 2024 2030 2035 2050 Other transport Road transport Other industry EI industries Total final consumption (EJ) Other Services Residential CPS 100 200 2010 2024 2050 Other Wind and solar PV Hydro Nuclear Natural Oil Coal CPS Total energy demand (EJ) gas IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 391 8 In the decade to 2024, China was responsible for more than two-thirds of global demand growth for oil. Its demand for oil declines by 2035 in the STEPS and CPS, and EVs have much to do with this trend. In 2024, nearly half of car sales in China were electric, of which two\u0002thirds were priced lower than their conventional equivalents. Their competitiveness sees electric cars rise to account for over 80% of sales by 2030 in the STEPS. The strong growth of high-speed rail also avoids oil demand (see Chapter 4, Box 4.1). As a result, oil demand for road transport in China starts to decline. By 2035, its total oil demand is around 15 mb/d or 5% below today’s level (Figure 8.26). This is broadly in line with the projections of China’s oil major, Sinopec (Sinopec EDRI, 2025). The CPS sees little additional upside for total oil demand in China by 2035, given the competitiveness of EVs and policy commitment to them. Figure 8.26 ⊳ Oil and natural gas demand by sector in China in the STEPS, 2010-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Oil demand peaks before 2030, curbed by EVs; gas demand rises, but electrification and energy efficiency limit the upside in key end-use sectors Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; EI industries = energy-intensive industries. China was responsible for nearly one-third of the global increase in demand for natural gas over the past decade. Demand continues to grow in both the STEPS and CPS but is limited by the electrification of end-uses. Industrial production in China is already highly electrified, 27% of industry energy consumption versus nearly 10% for gas. Electricity continues to gain ground in industry in the future. The transport sector sees increasing natural gas demand for trucks, over 25% of heavy-freight truck sales were natural gas fuelled in 2024, but it still accounts for a relatively small share of total gas demand. In the power sector, natural gas demand increases, but its growth potential is limited by competition with coal, pumped hydro and batteries, which play critical roles in balancing rising shares of variable renewables. The CPS sees a slightly higher upside for gas, with demand reaching 630 bcm by 2035, an increase of 8% on the STEPS. 5 10 15 20 2010 2024 2035 Road transport Other transport Other Non-energy use Other Transport Other buildings Space heating Other industry EI industries Power sector Oil Natural gas Avoided by EVs Oil demand (mb/d) 150 300 450 600 2010 2024 2035 CPS Natural gas demand (bcm) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 392 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.8.2 Future of coal in China: growth ahead or peak on the horizon? The massive electricity sector in China accounts for two-thirds of its coal demand. Industry is responsible for most of the remainder, but its demand for coal is declining: coal consumption in the industry sector peaked in 2014 and has since declined by 25%. Given that most industrial coal use is to produce cement and steel in China, the saturation of its housing and infrastructure needs means that demand for coal in industry will continue to decline. By 2035, coal consumption in industry in China is a further 20% below the 2024 level in the STEPS. Therefore, the electricity sector will determine the future of coal in China. In the last five years, China has added more renewables and nuclear generation capacity than the rest of the world combined, and solar PV and wind now account for 18% of generation. Despite this, coal demand for electricity rose by more than 25% from 2019 to 2024 (Figure 8.27). As a result, coal consumption in the electricity sector reached 2 250 Mtce in 2024 (65 EJ). This is more than the total energy demand from all sources combined – coal, gas, nuclear, oil and renewables – of any other country in the world, except the United States.

From 2010 to 2024, the share of electricity generation in China’s coal demand increased from 45 to 65%, driven by strong electricity demand growth Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; GDP = gross domestic product. Economic growth in China has been very electricity-intensive in the post Covid pandemic period. Electricity consumption in the residential, industry and services sectors rose faster than economic activity in the 2019 to 2024 period.

However, it also has over 200 GW of coal generation capacity under construction. The low capital costs of coal plants in China means that operating them flexibly to support renewables has much lower opportunity costs than in other markets. Even at a 30% capacity factor, its average levelised cost of coal generation at USD 80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) is lower than the levelised cost of gas at USD 110/MWh. Figure 8.28 ⊳ Electricity generation from coal and renewables to 2035 by scenario and coal demand by scenario in China to 2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Coal demand peaks and declines by 20% in the STEPS, led by declines in coal-fired power generation; in the CPS, higher demand and lower renewables keep coal higher for longer Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour; Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent. Sinopec scenario results are from China Energy Outlook 2060 (Sinopec EDRI, 2025). Therefore, the outlook for coal in China is shaped by a three-way race between booming renewables growth, rising electricity demand, and efforts to make the grid more modern and flexible. How this race plays out differs in the STEPS and CPS, but the long-term trends point to a peak and decline (Figure 8.28). In the CPS, electricity demand is higher than in the STEPS by 2035: the CPS sees a lower level of electrification, but it also sees fewer of the efficiency gains that dampen demand growth in the STEPS. Capacity additions of renewables average around 480 GW per year in the STEPS, compared to around 450 GW per year in the CPS. Curtailment rises in the STEPS, but efforts to add more flexibility through battery storage, pumped hydro and grid capacity keep the curtailment rate far lower than in the CPS. Even with the higher levels of electricity demand seen in the CPS, China’s huge renewables manufacturing capacity and the economic competitiveness of renewables lead to sufficient growth in renewables capacity to put coal into decline. As a result, total coal demand falls by around 20% to 2035 in the STEPS and by around 10% in the CPS. 4 000 8 000 0 4 000 8 000 Wind and solar PV Coal 2024 2035 2035 Annual electricity demand growth: 6% 2% Coal versus wind and solar PV (TWh) 2 000 4 000 2010 2050 CPS STEPS Sinopec scenario range Coal demand (Mtce) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 394 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.9 India 8.9.1 Key energy trends India is the largest source of energy demand growth in the world in our Outlook. Energy demand increases by over 15 EJ by 2035 in the STEPS, which is nearly as much as the demand growth in China and all Southeast Asian countries combined. India is the largest contributor to growth in oil demand in this period, the second-largest for electricity generation and coal demand growth, and third-largest natural gas demand growth. Energy demand in India is being propelled by increasing economic activity. Between 2010 and 2024, its GDP growth rate was second only to that of China among major countries and regions. In the period to 2035, GDP grows on average by 6.1% each year in India, which is more than any other major country or region, and its GDP per capita is 75% higher in 2035 than today (see Chapter 2, Table 2.1). India is currently well below the global average on a range of key energy and economy-wide indictors, but it has been moving towards them, and it continues to do so over the next decade (Figure 8.29). India adds the equivalent of one Bangalore every year to its urban population to 2035, and its built floor space expands by 40%. It also adds nearly 12 000 cars to its roads every day, and well over 250 million air conditioners to its homes over the next decade. Figure 8.29 ⊳ Per capita energy and economy indicators in India relative to the world average in the STEPS, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. India has been steadily catching up with world averages on key energy and economic indicators, although many remain below the global average to 2050 Note: AC = air conditioner; CO2 = carbon dioxide.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 395 8 energy; reducing fossil fuel import dependence; improving the reliability of electricity supplies; reducing air pollution; and cutting GHG emissions. To meet its myriad energy sector challenges and ambitions, India has instituted a wide range of policies and programmes. A key challenge is to provide universal access to modern energy. India has made remarkable progress in improving energy access in recent decades, but nearly 20% of its population continues to rely in whole or in part on traditional biomass for cooking. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana policy seeks to address this by providing subsidies for LPG use for poor households. India has pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, and has adopted several short-term targets, one of which aims to increase non-fossil power generation capacity (section 8.9.2). Its long-term targets are supported by a goal to scale up nuclear power capacity to 100 GW by 2047 from 8 GW today, its plan to implement a carbon market for select industries in 2026, and a biofuels mandate that has achieved an ethanol blending rate of 20% in gasoline in 2025 with a view to also displace oil imports. With policy support, solar PV and wind are the fastest growing sources of energy to 2050 in the STEPS, and reach nearly 20% of the energy mix, although coal and oil remain mainstays (Figure 8.30). Energy demand grows fastest in the industry and transport sectors, with industry alone accounting for over half of the demand increase by 2050. CO2 emissions in India peak around 2040 in the STEPS, and by 2050 they stand at around 3.4 gigatonnes (Gt) per year. Figure 8.30 ⊳ Total energy demand by source and total final consumption by sector in India in the STEPS, 2010-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. 396 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.9.2 India hits 50% non-fossil power capacity target early: what is next? In support of its long-term objective of net zero emissions by 2070, in 2022 India announced an objective to increase the share of non-fossil sources in the power generation mix to 50% by 2030. India met this target for grid-connected capacity in 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In the STEPS, it meets it in 2026 even when auto-producers, which is production of electricity by a facility primarily for its own use, is included (Figure 8.31). This success was underpinned by surging investment in renewables. In 2015, every dollar invested in fossil power generation sources in India was broadly matched by a dollar invested in non-fossil sources, a 1:1 ratio. By 2025, this ratio had increased to 1:4 in favour of non-fossil sources. Solar PV alone has attracted USD 113 billion in cumulative investment in the past decade, compared with USD 112 billion for all fossil fuel power generation sources combined. Figure 8.31 ⊳ Installed power capacity and electricity generation by source in India in the STEPS, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Excludes battery storage and includes auto-producers. The share of non-fossil sources in installed generation capacity rises to 60% in 2030 and 70% in 2035 in the STEPS, and accounts for over 95% of capacity increases to 2035. This is a striking contrast to the 2015-2024 period, when coal and natural gas accounted for over 70% of increased generation. Nevertheless, led by industry, demand for coal rises moderately to 2035, and coal continues to be a mainstay in the electricity generation mix, providing valuable dispatchable generation and flexibility. Solar PV and wind power see their share of generation rise from 11% today to over 25% by 2030 and to nearly 40% by 2035. Generation from nuclear triples by 2035. As a result, non-fossil sources are responsible for over half of electricity generation in India by 2035 in the STEPS.

Other benefits include significant declines in emissions of key air pollutants such as fine particulates and sulphur dioxide. The rising share of variable renewables in power generation brings with it both challenges and opportunities. One challenge is the need for investment in storage and transmission to facilitate the deployment of renewables. In the STEPS, over 230 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery storage are added to the system by 2030 (Figure 8.32). The government is in the process of putting out tenders for new storage capacity. By 2030 in the STEPS, the transmission network expands by 35% with over 200 000 km of new transmission lines, including nearly 60 000 km of lines to facilitate the integration of renewables. India’s Green Energy Corridor project seeks to address some of this gap by facilitating the construction of transmission lines to support generation from renewable sources. Figure 8.32 ⊳ Battery capacity additions, 2022-2030, and transmission network expansion in India in the STEPS to 2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Rising power generation from variable renewables is complemented by accelerating battery capacity additions and grid expansion Note: GW = gigawatt; km = kilometres. India faces challenges arising from the financial weakness of distribution companies, exemplified by delayed payments to generation companies totalling USD 7 billion in October 2025. A range of reforms have been instituted including: establishment of a payment security mechanism; a payment security fund; and state government guarantees to increase investor confidence in renewable energy projects. These reforms along with other risk mitigation measures have helped double the share of foreign direct investment in total power sector investment to nearly 10% over its average between 2015 and 2020 (IEA, 2025e). 150 300 450 600 2024 2025-2030 additions Thousand km Transmission network Replacements Renewables Increased Drivers for expansion demand 3 6 9 12 2022-24 2025-27 2028-30 GW Battery capacity additions IEA. CC BY 4.0. 398 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.10 Japan and Korea 8.10.1 Key energy trends GDP in Japan and Korea is set to grow by 0.8% per year to 2050 while the population in the region continues to contract by 0.6% per year over the period. Digitalisation, automation and high value‑added sectors, e.g. AI, robotics and semiconductors, underpin the economic outlook as governments double down on innovation, productivity gains, and industry transformation to offset labour shortages and sustain economic growth. Japan’s energy strategy, guided by the 7th Strategic Energy Plan, adopted in February 2025, outlines multiple pathways to achieve decarbonisation and energy security. A key shift is the explicit elevation of renewables to a mainstream power source to provide 40-50% of power generation by 2040, up from 24% in 2024. The Energy Plan also marks a turning point in nuclear policy: it positions nuclear power – alongside renewables – as indispensable for both energy security and effective decarbonisation. It envisagesto increase in the share of nuclear power from 9% in 2024 to approximately 20% by 2040. However, uncertainties remain around reactor restarts, including that the timing of restarts will depend on safety reviews and facility upgrades, and public understanding. Delays could force reliance on alternative sources, complicating the decarbonisation and energy security path. Korea’s 11th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand, 2024-2038, seeks to balance rising demand with commitments to decarbonise while taking account of energy security considerations. The share of nuclear in power generation is set to expand from around 30% to 35% by 2038 as new reactors and small modular reactors are brought into service. The share of renewables in generation is expected to increase, and the shares of coal and LNG to decrease. By 2038, over 70% of generation is expected to come from low-emissions sources including nuclear, renewables and hydrogen/ammonia, with the twin aims of enhancing energy security and moving toward carbon neutrality. Uncertainties remain, but Korea is likely to maintain support for existing nuclear plant life extensions and small modular reactor development, though the pace of large new nuclear projects may slow. Its overall focus may increasingly shift toward renewables and next-generation technologies. Reflecting these strategies and policies, electricity demand in the region increases to about 1 660 TWh in the STEPS and to just over 1 670 TWh in the CPS by 2040 from around 1 460 TWh in 2024. In the STEPS, the transport sector is responsible for over 35% of electricity demand growth. In the CPS, demand growth is led by the buildings sector, which accounts for almost 50% of the total. One cause of demand growth in both scenarios is a rapid increase in electricity demand to serve data centres. Their electricity demand in Japan and Korea today is a little over 20 TWh and is supported by just over 5 GW of installed capacity. In the near term, electricity demand for data centres is projected to nearly double in both scenarios, contributing to about 20% of growth in electricity demand between 2024 and 2030. IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 399 8 With policy support in both countries for low-emissions fuels and enhanced energy security, fossil fuel demand decreases between 2024 and 2040 at an annual average rate of 1.5% in the CPS and over 2% in the STEPS (Figure 8.33). Regional energy-related CO2 emissions have been decreasing since 2014 with minor fluctuations along the way, and this trend continues in both scenarios. In 2040, energy-related CO2 emissions in the region are over 30% lower than today in the CPS, and 40% lower in the STEPS. Figure 8.33 ⊳ Oil and natural gas demand and renewables capacity by scenario in Japan and Korea, 2010-2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Stable transitions reflect continued progress toward cleaner energy systems while maintaining reliable supply amid electricity demand growth Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; GW = gigawatts. Natural gas plays an important role in both scenarios as a dispatchable energy source, but both see a gradual reduction in its use after 2030. Renewables capacity increases less rapidly in the CPS than in the STEPS, which means that demand for gas stays higher. Natural gas demand currently stands at around 150 bcm. In the CPS, this is projected to increase until the early 2030s before returning to around today’s level in 2040. In the STEPS, natural gas demand declines by 10% by 2040 from the current level. Both countries attach significant importance to boosting renewables as they seek to make progress towards the goal of achieving net zero emissions. Renewables capacity increases in both scenarios, though at different rates. In the CPS, it is projected to increase by about 1.5 times by 2040; in the STEPS, it almost doubles to 420 GW thanks to additional policy support and more rapid technology development. 2 4 6 8 2010 2024 2040 Current Policies Scenario Stated Policies Scenario Oil demand (mb/d) 50 100 150 200 2010 2024 2040 Natural gas demand (bcm) 120 240 360 480 2010 2024 2040 Renewables capacity (GW) IEA. CC BY 4.0. 400 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 8.10.2 Energy security in a shifting geopolitical landscape Fossil fuels accounted for 80% of total energy demand in Japan and Korea in 2024, almost all of which was imported. These fossil fuel imports travel through critical chokepoints: approximately 70% of crude oil imports through the Strait of Hormuz; 85% through the Strait of Malacca; and over 70% of LNG imports through the South China Sea. Price levels for spot LNG have been very volatile in recent years, reaching an average of USD 34 per million British thermal units (MBtu) and peaking at USD 85/MBtu in 2022 as prices rose for a prolonged period during the energy crisis experienced that year. In 2024 the price fell to an average of USD 12/MBtu, but the geopolitically driven price swings in 2022 prompted Japan and Korea to boost investment in regional energy sources, expand strategic reserves, and seek to build diversified supply chains through new policies and corporate commitments (Table 8.2). In parallel, both governments introduced emergency fiscal measures to cushion short-term price shocks; Japan has spent over JPY 10 trillion (USD 67 billion considering the 2024 annual average exchange rate) since 2022 on subsidiesfor gasoline, electricity and gas consumption. Table 8.2 ⊳ Key areas of co-operation to enhance energy security in the Asia Pacific region by Japan and Korea Area Example Regional partnerships • Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) (Japan). • ASEAN-ROK Strategic Partnership, Minerals Security Partnership (Korea). Regional (near-shore) energy supply diversification • Investment in various LNG and gas upstream ventures including foreign direct investment in the Asia Pacific region since 2022: SK Innovation, JAPEX in Indonesia; Mitsui in Viet Nam; Mitsubishi in Malaysia; SK E&S, JERA and JOGMEC in Australia; JERA in United States; Mitsubishi in Canada. Self/regional sufficiency in renewable energy • Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Siemens Partnership to build wind supply chains in Japan, various projects in ASEAN under the AZEC. • Korean battery-cell manufacturing (LG/HYUNDAI) in Indonesia supports regional EV/renewables. Critical minerals diversification • Approved battery minerals and uranium projects under the Economic Security Promotion Act, including nickel mining project in Australia (Japan). • Reintroduced the investment tax credit system for overseas resource development and established the Supply Chain Stabilisation Fund (Korea). Japan and Korea have been pursuing various measures to boost investor confidence in stable, low-emissions technologies to support decarbonisation, energy security and affordability. Nuclear power is one such technology. It is being promoted by the two countries as a dispatchable, low-carbon source which complements variable renewables and can help achieve decarbonisation goals, enhance energy self-sufficiency and reduce fossil fuel import bills. Today, nuclear generates 280 TWh of electricity in the region, which is close to the combined generation of other major low-emissions sources including solar PV, hydro, bioenergy and wind (Figure 8.34). In both scenarios, nuclear remains the largest source of low-emissions electricity in the region, reaching almost 500 TWh in 2040. In Japan, the IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 401 8 priority now is to restart existing reactors to increase the share of generation in addition to announcing plans to build new reactors. In Korea, the priority is to move ahead with two new reactors (Saeul 3 and 4) under construction. If nuclear power development is delayed and generation remains at current levels, more than 180 GW of additional solar PV capacity or almost 40 bcm of extra gas will be required in the region in 2040 to fill the gap. Figure 8.34 ⊳ Low-emissions electricity generation by source in Japan and Korea in the STEPS, 2024 and 2040 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Nuclear energy plays a central role to decarbonise the power sector, accounting for about 40% of low-emissions electricity in 2040 Note: TWh = terawatt-hour. Circumstances in the two countries differ, but public leadership is essential in both to establish predictable licensing processes for the development of nuclear power, implement institutional reforms that improve profitability, and create financial instruments such as loan guarantees, green bonds or dedicated investment funds to mobilise private capital. At the same time, investing in workforce development and diversifying supply chains will strengthen resilience and competitiveness. Korea has a key strength in this area, supported by robust domestic and international nuclear projects. Equally important is a clear pathway for the safe and final disposal of nuclear waste, which is critical for both public trust and long\u0002term sustainability. In Japan, the legal process for selecting a site has been progressing steadily. By providing transparent roadmaps and addressing public concerns, policy makers can help to ensure nuclear energy remains a pillar of a low-emissions future. Electricity grids are another essential investment in energy security. It has been difficult for some system operators in Japan to advance transmission projects under the national Master Plan of Nationwide Power Transmission, including the largest project that costs JPY 3 trillion (USD 20 billion), but these are essential for secure operation of the power sector. 100 200 300 400 500 Nuclear Solar PV Wind Hydro Bioenergy 2024 2040 TWh IEA.

Its GDP increased by nearly 5% year-on-year in 2024 and is expected to continue to increase by 4% per year on average through to 2035, boosted by its position as a global manufacturing hub. Total energy demand in Southeast Asia has increased by 40% since 2015 as its economy expanded. Some 97% of households now have access to electricity, and the region is on track to achieve full access by 2030. The surge in energy demand resulted in a doubling of coal consumption since 2015, mostly for power, while demand for oil and natural gas rose by more than 10%. Modern bioenergy has emerged as an important fuel, with its consumption doubling since 2015, second only to coal in terms of absolute growth since 2015. Figure 8.35 ⊳ Energy demand by source and total energy-related CO2 emissions by scenario in Southeast Asia, 2015-2050 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Building on a 40% increase since 2015, total energy demand rises another third by 2035 in the STEPS; coal demand grows the most in absolute terms Note: EJ = exajoule; Gt CO2 = gigatonnes of carbon dioxide. In the STEPS, energy demand continues to rise rapidly, by nearly a third by 2035 (Figure 8.35). Coal sees the largest absolute increase, followed by natural gas and oil. Bioenergy demand slows, while solar PV and wind power meet an increasing share of demand. In the CPS, energy demand rises faster: coal and natural gas consumption increases by roughly a third to 2035, and oil and bioenergy consumption by about a quarter. Integration challenges associated with a less flexible generation mix and more constrained grids mean that solar PV and wind expand nearly 20% more slowly in the CPS than in the STEPS. 20 40 60 2015 2024 2035 2050 EJ Coal Oil Natural gas Nuclear Hydro STEPS 1 2 3 2024 2035 2050 Gt CO₂ Modern bioenergy Solar and wind Other CPS Emissions (right axis) IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 403 8 Eight Southeast Asian countries have targets to reach net zero emissions by years in the 2050-2065 range. In the STEPS, regional CO2 emissions rise from 2 Gt today to 2.4 Gt by 2035. They start to plateau by the late 2040s, but fossil fuel consumption continues to increase by about 0.5% per year, and annual emissions reach 2.5 Gt by 2050. In the CPS, emissions rise to over 3 Gt by mid-century. Falling oil production and rising demand in the transport sector lead to net oil imports increasing in Southeast Asia from 3.3 mb/d in 2024 to 4.7 mb/d by 2035 in the STEPS and 4.8 mb/d in the CPS. A combination of declining natural gas production and increasing demand shifts the region from a net exporter to a net importer of gas before the end of this decade. Demand for imported gas is met primarily through an increase in LNG imports by countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and Viet Nam, where the gas is mostly used to meet growing demand in the power and industry sectors. Net imports reach almost 70 bcm in the STEPS by 2035 but are roughly 20% lower in the CPS, reflecting slightly weaker demand and higher domestic production. Figure 8.36 ⊳ Fossil fuel production, demand and trade balance in Southeast Asia in the STEPS, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Southeast Asia is set to become a net importer of natural gas over the course of the next decade, while oil import dependency continues to increase Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent. Coal production in Southeast Asia surged from 400 Mtce to 670 Mtce between 2015 and 2024 as a result of rising consumption in the power sector and robust demand for exports, notably from China and India. The next decade, however, is set to mark a turnaround: in the STEPS, a slowdown in the rate of growth of domestic coal consumption and falling exports of Indonesian coal to China lead to a sustained decline in regional coal production to around 2 4 6 2015 2024 2035 Domestic supply Net imports Net exports Oil (mb/d) 250 500 750 2015 2024 2035 Demand Production Coal (Mtce) 100 200 300 2015 2024 2035 Natural gas (bcm) IEA.

In the CPS, higher demand means that coal production declines more slowly than in the STEPS. 8.11.2 Unpacking the fast growth of electricity demand and supply Southeast Asia recorded the second-fastest rate of electricity demand growth in 2024 among major regions and countries: only in China did it increase more rapidly. Demand was up by 7% year-on-year, rising to 1 300 TWh, with Indonesia seeing the fastest rate of growth at over 9%. The rate of growth in 2024 was in line with the trend in recent years. Since 2015, the electricity demand in Southeast Asia has increased by 65%, with non-energy-intensive industries accounting for over 40% of it, supported by electrification of their processes. Today, its industrial electrification rate is comparable to that of the European Union. Southeast Asia remains one of the world’s fastest growing regions for industrial production to 2035. In the STEPS, electricity demand rises by around 4% a year to reach 2 100 TWh by 2035 (Figure 8.37). Efficiency gains moderate demand growth, which would otherwise rise to about 6% per year. Non-energy-intensive industries account for more than 25% of the electricity demand growth to 2035. Annual demand from data centres increases from just over 10 TWh today to 25 TWh by 2030. Much of the data centre demand is concentrated in Singapore and the Johor province of Malaysia.

CC BY 4.0. Chapter 8 | Regional insights 405 8 Space cooling accounts for about a quarter of the electricity demand increase to 2035. Today, despite having among the highest cooling needs in the world, fewer than 30% of households in Southeast Asia have air conditioning. By 2035, the ownership ratio more than doubles in the STEPS to about the levels seen in advanced economies today. Over 30% of new cars sold by 2035 are electric in the STEPS, and around 15% in the CPS, up from around 10% today. The impact on overall electricity demand growth is small, but EVs displace around 0.5 mb/d of oil use in the STEPS by 2035, making oil demand 6% lower than it would be otherwise. Figure 8.38 ⊳ Electricity generation by source and average annual power sector investment in Southeast Asia in the STEPS, 2015-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Natural gas, coal, wind and solar PV supply most of the additional power needed by 2035 in the STEPS and power sector investment increases significantly Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour; MER = market exchange rate. Other includes marine, concentrating solar power, waste-to-energy and other sources. Coal has met most of the increase in electricity demand over the past two decades in Southeast Asia. Demand for coal continues to rise in the STEPS, but it is supplanted by natural gas as the largest source of additional electricity. Meanwhile additions of wind and solar PV capacity accelerate, supported by policy initiatives and declining costs, and combined they account for 35% of the additional electricity generated in 2035 in the STEPS. Towards 2035, battery storage plays an increasingly important role to help integrate the rising share of variable renewables into the power grids, together with grid modernisation, demand response and measures to increase the flexibility of the conventional power plant fleet. Nuclear enters the supply mix after 2035, with both Indonesia and Viet Nam seeking to commission their first reactors by the middle of the next decade. Coal-fired electricity generation increases more strongly in the CPS, driven by slower uptake of wind and solar PV. 600 1 200 1 800 2 400 2015 2024 2035 Coal Natural gas Oil Nuclear Wind Solar PV Hydro Bioenergy Other Electricity generation (TWh) 15 30 45 60 2015 -2024 2025 -2035 Grids Generation Billion USD (2024, MER) Average annual power sector investments IEA. CC BY 4.0. 406 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2025 Meeting the projected growth in electricity demand and ensuring security of supply will require scaling up investment in generation, domestic networks and interconnections. In the STEPS, total power sector investment increases 80% to USD 60 billion in 2035 (Figure 8.38). Various sources of finance will be required to support the region’s energy and sustainability objectives, including a role for transition finance (Box 8.3). However, regulatory barriers, policy instability, high interest rates and a lack of public financial commitments remain barriers for the mobilisation of the necessary capital in the Southeast Asian emerging economies. Box 8.3 ⊳ Role of transition finance in Southeast Asia and the world Actions by the most emissions-intensive sectors, companies and countries are crucial to placing the world on a sustainable path, and efforts within the Southeast Asian region hold a position of particular importance. While there is strong attention on supporting green investment in the region, and such support will need to remain a priority going forward, such investment alone cannot deliver all the change needed to cut emissions, especially in areas where clean technologies are not yet commercially available or cost competitive. Transition finance can help emissions-intensive countries, companies, and sectors shift over time towards sustainable practices, aligned with long-term climate and development goals. At present, transition finance flows in Southeast Asia and elsewhere remain modest. But scenarios consistent with national or global emissions reduction targets suggest that USD 400-500 billion per year in transition finance could be mobilised over the next decade. This totals to USD 4-5 trillion in this period, with more than half directed to emerging market and developing economies. This is comparable in scale to the current global green bond market. Uptake has been slowed thus far by challenges associated with defining transition finance, but with credible government and corporate strategies, transition finance can help unlock investment for projects that fall outside the green finance label but are nonetheless essential for sustainable transitions (IEA, 2025f). Guidance on applying transition finance in Southeast Asia was prepared in the framework of the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum, a group of capital market regulators (ACMF, 2024). Recognising that not every company in the region is able to commit to a 1.5 °C target, the framework introduced a tiered approach to enable companies to be categorised as aligned and aligning to 1.5 °C, aligned and aligning to well below 2 °C, or those that are ‘progressing’, referring to companies that have not yet committed to these targets, but are taking steps to align in the near future. The guidance provides entities with a framework to evaluate and demonstrate a credible transition in the region and to facilitate access to financing. It also recognises the need for flexibility to accommodate the region’s small and medium-size enterprises that may otherwise lack the capacity and expertise to participate in the market for transition finance.

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India [CPI]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external secu\u0002rity partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of do\u0002mestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an In\u0002dian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime secu\u0002rity activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counter\u0002terrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington. 2 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Introduction This paper frames the contours of the recent and ongoing expansion in U.S.-India security ties. Then it briefly sketches the trajectory of the Naxalite insurgency through its first two phases and then focuses on the factors that made its third phase—from 2004 to the present—such a serious security challenge. The paper highlights the unique domestic factors that allowed the Naxalite rebellion’s rise to the status of India’s most significant internal security challenge from 2007 to 2010. It also identifies those domestic factors that enabled effective counterinsurgency actions beginning in 2011 and effective containment of the threat by 2014. After indicating the kinds of bilateral security assistance offered by the United States to India in recent years, the paper indicates the limited appeal of outside assistance to India in the domestic counterinsur\u0002gency arena and assesses why India’s self-selected counterinsurgency partnership limitations remain firmly in place. It concludes with some lessons learned for U.S. policymakers in terms of the opportunities and limitations for working with India in matters of domestic insurgency, advising that these limitations make sense on many levels. It also asserts that India’s limitations should be respected in Washington and Honolulu to avoid backlash from New Delhi. Any such backlash might threaten far more important U.S.-India bilateral interests in which shared mari\u0002time and other strategic interests seem to increasingly diverge with those of China and in areas of mutual benefit from global counterterrorism cooperation. The analysis in this paper is based on 3 years of author research into the unique features of the Naxalite insurgency in India. The research includes field interviews conducted on three visits to India during 2014 and 2015, one of which featured time in Kolkata and West Bengal. Expanding U.S.-India Security Framework, with Limits Growing for more than a decade, bilateral defense and security cooperation between the United States and India began accelerating quickly in 2014 and continued into 2016. Much of this acceleration, although not all of it, owed to the tone and tenor of the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected and seated in 2014. Modi’s government, which is Indian nationalist with a dynamic economic, diplomatic, and security agenda, followed a decade-long Indian National Congress (INC) government that had become sclerotic in its dealings with the United States and other global partners from 2009 to 2013. The INC government set the table for U.S.-India defense and security cooperation during the mid-2000s, demonstrating a broad\u0002based Indian commitment to improved bilateral relations with the United States after decades 3 India’s Naxalite Insurgency of limited transactions. But the nationalist government of Prime Minister Modi has been driv\u0002ing it forward vigorously. The ongoing acceleration in broad Indo-American relations has taken many forms, in\u0002cluding high diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi made visiting the United States a priority, travel\u0002ing to America within 4 months of his May 2014 accession to the position of prime minister. Modi then made President Barack Obama the first ever U.S. President bestowed the high honor as chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade in January 2015. During this visit, Obama and Modi signed a historic Joint U.S.-India Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.1 Modi made a third informal visit to the United States in September 2015, using this historically rapid return to enhance economic relations between the national private and public sectors.2 The United States has committed to a wide array of economic projects in India fea\u0002turing public-private innovation, deeper financial cooperation and inclusive digital networks, “smart city” development in selected Indian cities, and support for increasing economic con\u0002nectivity between India and the states of South and Southeast Asia.3 The acceleration of broad bilateral ties has been showcased by the steady increase in de\u0002fense and security cooperation between the two countries. In June 2016, on a historic fourth visit to the United States and in conjunction with a third bilateral summit,4 Prime Minister Modi made a joint statement with President Obama declaring India and the United States to be “major defense partners,” expressing aspirations for expanded exchange of dual-use technolo\u0002gies and maritime security cooperation.5 The outcomes from this mid-2016 leadership engage\u0002ment underscored the fact that there have been noteworthy enhancements in military technol\u0002ogy interaction processes, basic military logistics and administrative arrangements, and joint military exercises. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi has accelerated the process of bilateral security collabo\u0002ration on military modernization with emphasis on greater foreign investment in the Indian defense sector than ever before. Modi’s government covets American participation in India’s defense industry build-out to a degree not seen in the previous Indian government. The United States has worked to expand its 2012 bilateral defense initiative with India known as the U.S.- India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Pursuant to President Obama’s January 2015 visit for Republic Day, the United States has focused DTTI in pursuit of six major defense technology co-development and co-production efforts. There has been a particular focus on deeper cooperation in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.6 The United States and India also have done serious work on establishing basic frame\u0002work defense agreements that would enable closer cooperation and collaboration between their 4 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 militaries. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, both governments worked hard to develop mutu\u0002ally acceptable text for three critical military-to-military agreements. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), Basic Exchange and Coopera\u0002tion Agreement (BECA), and—perhaps the most consequential of the three—Logistics Supply Agreement.7 Aimed to move beyond the limited U.S.-India 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement that underpinned modest U.S.-India defense interactions for more than a decade, the bilateral effort on these documents demonstrated important forward prog\u0002ress. Yet this progress did not beget culmination in formal agreements. Many observers hoped that these arrangements would be ready for signature during Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s April 2016 visit to New Delhi for discussions with Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar. But Indian sensitivities and complications in language and trust limited the April joint announce\u0002ment to one confirming that the defense leaders were agreed in principal—but had not yet signed—a modified Logistics Supply Agreement, known as a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement.8 It also signaled that both parties must continue to work on “other” agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer. The CISMOA and BECA were not formally mentioned in the final statement of the meeting.9 In the area of joint military exercises, the U.S.-India partnership has been expanding. In 2015, India conducted more joint military exercises with the U.S. military than any other in the world.10 India and United States agreed in 2015 to extend a permanent invitation for Japanese naval forces to participate annually in Exercise Malabar. The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations. While agreeing to participate in the 2016 Malabar exercise with Japan and the United States in the northern Philippines, India firmly declined an offer by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, to sign on for joint naval patrols with the United States, Japan, and Aus\u0002tralia in the South Pacific.12 India also has remained wary of any firm commitment to a bilateral defense CISMOA or BECA. Despite more than 2 years of bilateral effort, there remains no real progress on the joint development of jet engines or aircraft carrier technologies—both of which are target technologies for joint development.13 Each of these factors and more demonstrate that crafting a bilateral defense partnership between the United States and India will be a slow process 5 India’s Naxalite Insurgency that requires better understanding of differing critical equities. This process requires sustained, patient leadership in both countries in the face of certain frustrations moving forward. Scoping Bilateral Security Collaboration Limits: Indian Domestic Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism The U.S. and Indian militaries have their own detailed and unique experiences in counter\u0002insurgency operations, so counterinsurgency seems a logical focal point for greater U.S.-India defense collaboration and partnership, and in many ways it is. But in other ways, it is not. U.S. policymakers and security analysts should understand the differences. When it comes to outside assistance and security partnership collaboration with India in its ongoing experiences with domestic insurgency, U.S. policymakers and military leaders must remain aware that India does not—and likely will not—treat U.S. military offers of direct assis\u0002tance with a warm welcome. India’s experiences with its long-running domestic Naxalite insur\u0002gency provide a powerful example about the limited scope for U.S. military engagement and the circumspect manner in which any U.S. security assistance must be approached with New Delhi. The lessons about context, tenor, and tone found in the example of the Naxalite insurgency over the past 10 years demonstrate that the United States is a better partner for India when remaining at distance, as New Delhi deals with its unique domestic insurgency challenges. India’s Approach to Domestic Insurgency Over the past 60 years, India has confronted three major domestic insurgencies.14 In Jam\u0002mu and Kashmir, disaffected Muslim groups and unsatisfied local populations have contested India’s so-called occupation of its territories on the southeastern side of the Line of Control. India’s northeast has undergone multiple, overlapping waves of tribal, socioethnic-based insur\u0002gent movements since the mid-1950s. These northeastern separatist insurgencies have ebbed and flowed as Indian military and political approaches to their grievances eliminated some and catalyzed others. India also has been confronted with economic class–based violence and armed confrontation in its eastern regions, violence referred to as a Naxalite or Maoist insurgency. Numerous Indian analysts, and some outsiders, argue that India has among the best re\u0002cords in the world when combating insurgencies.15 The claim is debatable on many levels. Yet it does accurately reflect that India has persistent experience with a variety of domestic insurgencies over a considerable period of time. Official Indian counterinsurgency doctrine formally espouses a population-centric strategy focused on winning “hearts and minds.”16 A more detailed examination of India’s record reveals that India often does take a political 6 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 approach in combination with a military one when facing domestic insurgencies. However, India’s political approaches often are less about hearts and minds and more often feature ex\u0002tended periods of national-level tolerance of state- and local-level politician and police leader\u0002ship manipulation of insurgent groups. Often this manipulation is in the pursuit of regional and local vote banks (or vote blocks). Frequently manipulation is followed by the co-option of rebellion elites in an effort to buy-out, or limit the insurgency once it festers to a level beyond the ability of the state and regional authorities to manage. Co-option approaches have taken the forms of turning insurgents through monetary compensation, creating new political space for a “turned” insurgent group, or abducting and torturing key insurgent leaders.17 Quite often these nonkinetic approaches have created their own problems with corrupt security forces, increased criminal activity, and a litany of human rights complaints and investigations.18 India’s employment of military forces in domestic counterinsurgency operations has fea\u0002tured a number of innovative practices, some successful and others counterproductive. When engaged fully, the Indian national response tends to feature a combination of state police forces, Central Armed Police Forces, special paramilitary units, and—in some cases such as Kashmir and India’s Northeast—the introduction of regular army units. India’s federal statutes mandate that the chief minister (or governor) of a state formally request national police (including Cen\u0002tral Armed Police Forces units), paramilitary, or national army support before such forces can be introduced into a counterinsurgency fight. In those cases when the army is introduced, it must be authorized by the prime minister and given authorities by the Indian parliament to operate under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which includes the authority for military forces to make arrests, search without warrants, and shoot to kill civilians when required.19 In\u0002dia’s martial counterinsurgency activities are normally “enemy centric” and have been assessed to regularly feature a strategy of attrition and raw coercion where overwhelming numbers of security forces attempt to suffocate the insurgency at the same time that political activities are conducted to co-opt its leadership.20 There are several important conclusions to be drawn about India’s historical approach to domestic counterinsurgency. First, India does pursue varied counterinsurgency approaches to its multiple domestic insurgencies, depending on the unique context of each. Some respons\u0002es—such as those in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast India—have featured a permanent deployment of the Indian army. Other responses, such as those toward the respective phases of the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India, have been limited to national central armed police forces (mainly but not exclusively Central Reserve Police Forces [CRPF]) deployment into the unsettled states from the central government (see appendix B for detail on national special 7 India’s Naxalite Insurgency police units). Second, India’s political and military approaches toward domestic insurgency generally do not follow a classic hearts and minds approach. Instead, they normally feature enemy-centric and highly kinetic military operations combined with creative, and often con\u0002troversial, political co-option of selected insurgent groups and group leaders. Third, India’s federal democratic structure often drives domestic counterinsurgency responses that feature uncomfortable political tradeoffs at the local level, state level, and between the state and the national governments. The political mobilization aspect of domestic insurgent groups creates incentives for political parties to harness these groups for their own ends.21 Invariably, this political utility makes them hard to counter in a timely manner and then difficult to address in the face of growing corruption, illegal activities, and often human rights questions as they embed into the political and social space. In general, Indian domestic counterinsurgency has worked for the country out and its distinctive system of governance and its complex national ethnic makeup. India’s approaches have contained, but not eliminated, the three major insurgencies that it has faced since inde\u0002pendence. But for many Westerners, India’s domestic counterinsurgency “successes” can look exceptionally violent and uncomfortably incomplete.22 This divergence in perspectives is im\u0002portant. It indicates why India prefers strict autonomy in the conduct of its domestic counterin\u0002surgent operations, routinely brushing aside the limited offers of direct outside military support that it receives. It also demonstrates why outside partners, including the United States, should realize that if they push too aggressively in offering well-intentioned direct assistance in these areas, they could encounter significant resistance in New Delhi—possible to the point where security cooperation could be dampened in other more important areas of mutual interest. India’s deep past and recent experiences with the Naxalite insurgency demonstrate the wisdom of these conclusions. The Naxalite Insurgency—History and Context: Phases 1 and 2 The Naxalite insurgency started as a communist peasant revolt in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It later evolved into a combination of ethnic-, caste-, and class-based political violence across a number of the poorest provinces in India’s east.23 It became known as Naxalism, or the Naxalite movement, given its late 1950s origins as a Maoist movement struggling for in\u0002dependence in the small village of Naxalbari in the state of West Bengal, along the Indo-Nepal border (see map 1).24 The 1967 Naxalbari uprising against feudal landlords sowed the seeds for insurgency in India.25 8 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 The Naxalites were a group of far-left radical communists who promoted Maoist political sentiment and ideology to fight exploitation by landlords in India’s feudal postcolonial socio\u0002economic system. In this approach, the Naxalites broke from the tradition of Indian communist Map 1. States and Union Territories of India 9 India’s Naxalite Insurgency political participation in the electoral system supplemented by general worker strikes that had been the staple of Communist Party of India activity from the 1920s through the 1950s.26 Dur\u0002ing the 1940s and 1950s, the CPI had become aligned with Moscow in its international leanings, functioning in India mainly as a political party. Around the same time, communism in India split in a third direction, with the CPI-Marxist group taking a more radical approach to its po\u0002litical rhetoric but mainly pursuing its own independent parliamentary path.27 Naxalism is based upon an extremist belief that the Indian government is a semicolonial, feudalistic, and imperial entity that needs to be overthrown. Naxalism’s objective is to seize state power through a protracted armed struggle against big landlords and petty government of\u0002ficials. Naxalism takes up the cause of the marginalized sections of society. It often opposes the implementation of various developmental projects such as construction of roads, rails, schools, and hospitals in affected areas in order to demonstrate to the people the ineffectiveness of the state. When successful, the Naxalite movement has operated in a vacuum created by the absence or collapse of the administrative structure at the local, provincial, or state level.28 The Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. A short review of the first two phases of the Naxalite insurgency establishes its patterns and India’s preferred security framework for dealing with this domestic stability threat. A more detailed review of the third and most noteworthy phase of the Naxalite insurgency follows in a subsequent section. First Phase, 1967–1973 Inspired by Maoist revolutionary tactics and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Naxalite movement gained momentum and began in the late 1960s and 1970s. Initially the movement centered in the Indian states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh (map 1). It featured peasants seizing land by force and then taking up arms to protect themselves against police and landlord response.29 Soon these rural activities merged with politically disillusioned and ideologically driven university students from Kolkata and other urban areas in India’s Far East—with active cells stretching from the state of Bihar in the north to Adhra Pradesh in the south. By 1969 un\u0002der charismatic leader Charu Mazumdar, the Naxalites organized as the CPI–Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) and attempted more centralized and violent tactics.30 CPI-ML moved to organize peasants and seize political power through guerilla warfare while focusing on annihilation of its class enemies.31 In urban areas such as Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), Naxalite insurgents 10 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 targeted police and local constables, attacking police outposts and patrols with an aim to cap\u0002ture weapons.32 Despite some limited weapons assistance and rhetorical support from Mao’s Communist government in the 1960s, China never undertook a strong campaign of support for the Nax\u0002alites.33 The Naxalites remained fragmented and without much training or organization. This first wave of Naxalite violence peaked in 1971 when over 3,650 acts of class-based attacks were reported and more than 850 people were reported killed. But it quickly succumbed to its own weaknesses and a state counterinsurgency response that featured two waves of activity. From the summer of 1969 through the end of 1971, state-led counterinsurgency campaigns against the rural Naxalite cadres decimated much of those insurgency cadres. State police, as\u0002sisted by the CRPF, moved against poorly armed Naxalites with great effect. By 1971 these po\u0002lice forces were joined by army units deployed into West Bengal. It took the failure of local and state police to contain Naxalite insurgents for more than 2 years before the West Bengal deputy chief minister—himself a politician from the CPI-Maoist party—requested assistance from a central paramilitary force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles, to assist state security forces. Then in July and August of 1971 a more dangerous component of the Naxalite insurgency in West Ben\u0002gal’s Birbhum District was put down by a joint campaign led by the army known as Operation Steeplechase. Army involvement only came after the collapse of an Indian National Congress– led coalition government in West Bengal and the New Delhi declaration of “President’s Rule” throughout the region. This made the central government responsible for the fight against the Naxalites and enabled Prime Minister Indira Ghandi to divert elements of the army massing along the East Pakistan border for what would become the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani War that assisted local police in decisive counterinsurgency operations.34 The urban dimension of the first wave of the Naxalite insurgency remained violent throughout 1971 and festered into the next 2 years, even as the rural component succumbed to Operation Steeplechase. Interparty political violence in Kolkata among the INC, CPI-M, and CPI-ML led to a swirl of assassinations and attacks against security forces and political leaders across urban areas. The election of a new West Bengal chief minister from the INC in March 1972 turned the tide on the urban Naxals. The law and order platform of Chief Minister Sid\u0002dharth Shankar Ray played out in a much more muscular police role across Kolkata and its surroundings throughout mid-1972 and into mid-1973. Kolkata police apprehended Naxalite leader Charu Maumdar in July 1972, and he died in custody several weeks later. Naxalite lead\u0002ers across the city succumbed to increasing police and state paramilitary presence. By 1973 the main cadres of the Naxalites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars.35 11 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In this first Naxalite insurgent phase, the national government followed a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent phases. It did not forcibly intervene in the beginning. In keep\u0002ing with the federalist framework of the constitution, the government in New Delhi left it to local and state officials in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and other afflicted states to take their own security actions to stop the threat. In the late 1960s, these state and local responses were often inadequate and ineffective.36 The central government only engaged with security forces once it had a critical mass of army forces in the region for the 1971–1972 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh and when the President’s Rule special authorities were in place, which enabled the military the power to make preventative arrests, search premises without a warrant, and shoot to kill civilians. Once engaged, the slowly evolving national response became one featuring intense force and coercion, eradicating the violence without eliminating the insurgency’s socio\u0002economic preconditions. Second Phase, 1977–1994 India’s first wave of insurgent violence ended badly for this domestic left-wing extremist movement but did not eliminate the conditions inspiring the movement or all of those willing to hold to the Naxalite cause. The movement fractured into more than 40 separate small groups.37 Slowly—over the course of a decade—these groups began to remobilize and consolidate. Par\u0002ticularly in the southeastern Indian state of Adhra Pradesh, a new Naxalite organization called People’s War emerged. Its leader, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, sought a more efficient structure to boost morale, recruitment, and funding. By 1978 Naxalite peasant revolts had spread to the Karimnagar District of Telangana and Adilabad District of Adhra Pradesh. The major grievance was unpaid wages. Second-wave Naxalite insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early 1980s insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked North Telangana village and Dan\u0002dakaranya forests areas along the Adhra Pradesh and Orissa border.38 In 1985 Naxalite insurgents began ambushing police. After they killed a police sub-inspec\u0002tor in Warangal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh responded by creating a special task force called the Greyhounds to establish control in the seven worst affected districts. An elite anti-Naxalite commando unit that still exists today, the Greyhounds were drawn from within the Andhra Pradesh police forces and given special treatment. A 2,000-strong force in 2015, the Grey\u0002hounds were given preferred payment and training—better than federal or state paramilitary forces. They were also highly supported by the entire state police force. The Greyhounds played a minimal role in combatting the Naxalites during the second phase of the Maoist insurgency.39 12 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In 1987 the Naxalite political party (People’s War) and other Maoist groups in Andhra Pradesh were barred from elections after kidnapped government officials were exchanged for Naxalite prisoners. The ban was briefly lifted in 1991. In December of that year, however, insur\u0002gent attacks increased. Affected states responded by establishing special laws that enabled police to focus on capture, detention, and extra-normal means of violence against Naxalite cadres— fighters and presumed supporters.40 Adhra Pradesh and Orissa invited additional central para\u0002military forces in Telangana to augment state and federal government security forces already there. Besides brute force, the state set up rival mass organizations to attract youth away from the Naxalites, started rehabilitation programs, and established new informant networks.41 The new counterinsurgency strategy reduced violent incidents, and nearly 9,000 Naxalites surrendered. Consequently in 1994 the ban on ostensibly moderate Naxalite political parties was lifted.42 The second wave of the Naxalite insurgency had been stopped. However, and as at the end of the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency, the socioeconomic conditions underpin\u0002ning Naxalism remained largely unchanged in many regions of eastern India. Third Phase, 2004–2015 From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s the Naxalite insurgency remained largely out of the public eye, but the movement had not gone away. Taking advantage of rising local support for violent response to economic conditions, fragmented Naxalite groups created a united front: the People’s War, Party Unity, and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) combined to form the People’s War Group (PWG). Naxalism manifested itself in episodic spurts of violence by the PWG, which had its most pronounced presence in Adhra Pradesh. From 1999–2002, local level violence increased. The PWG accelerated attacks on state government locations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. By 2000 an estimated 3,000 armed Naxalite rebels were re\u0002portedly active in India’s east.43 During this time, Indian government agencies took actions that accelerated grievances among the poor and displaced with sympathies for left-wing violence. First, economic growth and development led to local and state government appropriation of land for infrastructure and resource development, displacing many underprivileged people who had no political voice. Second, governments responded to Naxalite violence with acute violence, reportedly includ\u0002ing the extra-judicial murder and torture of suspected rebels and rebel families.44 The MCC intensified its campaign of violence against Indian security forces and government agencies in 2002–2003 after its leader was killed by police.45 13 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In 2004, the PWG was superseded by the CPI-M.46 From this 2004 merger of the two larg\u0002est Naxalite factions—the PWG and MCC—into the CPI-M, Maoist ideology was fused with a cadre of armed groups for the first time.47 A third and more lethal wave of violence—more sophisticated and more destructive—rapidly spread throughout eastern India. Naxalite leaders expanded control over natural resource rich areas (for example, coal, gas, precious minerals, and timber). They also collected taxes and extortion money to fund weapons production, including the production of crude but effective improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Estimates from 2004 to 2011 suggest the Naxalites extracted at least $18.4 million annually from government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.They embarked upon more choreographed terror campaigns including the murder of local politicians, overwhelming attacks on local police sta\u0002tions, impressment of child soldiers, and a general campaign to scare away outside investors. By the second half of 2005, Naxalites demonstrated a lethality and reach far beyond the capacity of other domestic terrorist and insurgent groups. They destroyed buildings, captured weapons, and killed several local policemen in an attack on a village in Uttar Pradesh. They also attacked the Jehanabad Prison in Bihar, killing two, freeing more than 300 inmates, and abduct\u0002ing about 30 inmates who were members of an anti-Naxalite group. Total deaths from Naxalite\u0002attributed insurgency and terrorism grew to more than 800 in the impacted east and north\u0002eastern regions.48 In 2006 and 2007, this trend expanded. In 2006, Naxalite groups launched several high-profile attacks against civilians and security forces, expanding the rural territory under Maoist control and under threat of extreme violence. In one event, an attack by some 800 armed Naxalites in Chhattisgarh killed 25, injured 80 more, and saw some 250 people declared missing.49 In 2006, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh grew concerned about the mounting threat posed by Naxalite groups to internal stability and democratic traditions across the east and southeast of India. The Naxalite menace had grown such that 18 of India’s federal states and 194 of its total districts were effected by Naxalite violence. For the first time Prime Minister Singh called the Naxalite/Maoist insurgency and associated terrorism “the sin\u0002gle biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”50 In 2007 Naxalite and Maoist violence reached an apex where it would remain for the next 4 years through 2010 (see map 2). Over 971 Naxalite attacks were recorded in the first seven months of 2007. That number would grow to over 1,500 attacks by the end of the year (see table51). Left-wing extremists began target\u0002ing elected officials including a member of the Indian parliament from Jharkhand state and the son of a former chief minister (or governor) of Andhra Pradesh.52 By 2010 the Naxalites were active in nine Indian states and reported to have a strong foot\u0002hold in parts of seven: West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, 14 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 and Maharashtra. This region happened to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric power potential. Across these states there were more than 2,200 incidents of Naxalite violence and almost 1,200 killed in 2010 alone (table).53 Map 2. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2007 15 India’s Naxalite Insurgency The threat to Indian national interests became obvious to the federal government and more co\u0002ordinated actions followed. From 2005 through 2010, Naxalite violence and the insufficient state-led, federally sup\u0002ported efforts to counter it cost India an average of more than 700 deaths per year. Most of these individuals were classified as civilian (see appendix A). Recruited from the disaffected rural poor, Naxalite cadres grew by 2010 to an estimated 20,000 armed fighters and an additional 50,000 supporters.54 In 2010, as he had first done in 2006, Prime Minister Singh trumpeted the risks of Naxalite violence to the stability and the ever important economic growth for the country. In May of that year, Prime Minister Singh referred to Naxalism as the “biggest internal security challenge” India has ever faced.55 The national government was understandably frustrated. From January to June 2009, India witnessed over 1,100 Naxalite-generated incidents of violence. These would double by the end of 2009 (table). Major violence occurred during national elections held from April to May 2009 as Naxalites called for an election boycott, attacked polling places, set off land mines, and even took control of a region of West Bengal known as Lalgarh. Paramilitary and police response operations against Naxalite locations were largely unsuccessful.56 Naxalite atrocities gained national notoriety. But simultaneously, accusations of systematic local police brutality and local and federal police human rights abuses against innocent civilians grew more vocal throughout the affected zones.57 In 2010 Naxalite violence inflicted 9 separate states of India and over 200 individual districts.58 Year 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 All Incidents 1,088 1,091 1,136 1,415 1,760 2,212 2,258 1,591 1,565 1,509 1,608 1,533 Attacks on Police 118 155 143 135 131 230 250 192 N/A 210 194 N/A Total Deaths 251 280 376 321 532 1,138 907 648 650 685 846 636 N/A = specific data not available Sources: “Left Wing Extremist (LWE) Data,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of Naxal Violence During 2008 to 2012,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of LWE Violence During 2011 to 2016 (up to 31.03.2016),” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs, “Annual Reports,” available at. Table. Major Incidents During Naxalite Insurgency, Third Phase 16 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In March 2010, after months of prevarication and confusion, the national government launched Operation Green Hunt. The initiative added an additional estimated 20,000 federal paramilitary troops, mainly from the CRPF battalions, to existing state, local, and already pres\u0002ent Ministry of Home Affairs forces from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Forc\u0002es, and Shashastra Seema Bal.59 (See appendix B for detail on MHA special police units.) The operation sent federal, state, and local police and paramilitary forces into former no-go zones deep in the forests of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states to rid them of militants, but these operations struggled. In April 2010, Naxalite insurgents ambushed 80 troops of the Indian Cen\u0002tral Police Security Forces (CPSF) in Chhattisgarh, killing an estimated 75 in the worst attack on Indian security forces since the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency began.60 In February 2011 Naxalites kidnapped two Indian government officials, demanding a halt to Green Hunt. The government agreed. The Naxalites also demanded the release of seven top imprisoned lead\u0002ers in exchange for the two officials. After a May 2011 Naxalite attack, 10 bodies of policemen were found dismembered in dense forest.61 Despite the major setbacks of 2010–2011, Indian federal and state authorities made some headway against a Naxalite insurgency now generating international headlines.62 Better coordi\u0002nated joint federal-state anti-Naxalite security operations killed a prominent Naxalite military leader, Koteswara Rao, in a November 2011 operation. In 2012 government paramilitary and police operations in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh began to produce results, with more than 1,800 Naxalite insurgents reported arrested and another 440 surrendered during the year.63 In late 2012 several Naxalite regional military leaders were captured and killed in those provinces. Acts of extreme violence continued during 2012 and 2013, but the expanse of the insur\u0002gency began to abate. Insurgency-related fatalities declined in 2012 and remained below 400 in 2013 (table). West Bengal reported sharp declines in Naxalite presence and activities dur\u0002ing 2013, although some observers declared that the decline in those states was offset by a corresponding increase of Naxalite violence in neighboring states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (appendix A). The Naxalites began the practice of including booby-trapping the bodies of dead Indian soldiers with IEDs in their stomachs. They killed national Congressman, and an\u0002ti-Naxalite militia Salwa Judum founder, Mahendra Karma in an attack on his convoy while he was campaigning for election in rural Chhattisgarh communities. Prime Minister Singh called for a two-pronged approach to dismantle the Naxalite network: sustaining joint and proactive military operations with greater economic development and responsible governance programs in the areas with strongest Maoist support. The CRPF successfully launched a 5-day interstate offensive in late December 2013 to dismantle core Maoist groups.64 It shut down a gun manu- 17 India’s Naxalite Insurgency facturing factory and recovered numerous weapons and explosives. Remote triggering devices were also found, indicating that the insurgency was using more advanced weaponry. By 2014 fatalities from Naxalite violence dropped below 300 for the first time in more than a decade (table). Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh remained most affected by the violence, and some Naxalite groups conducted operations and expanded into southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka states. But a review of the map in 2013 of Naxalite-impacted areas revealed a significant drop in the overall number of affected districts since 2007—from 165 to 120 overall—and an even more significant drop in districts categorized as experiencing severe or moderate amounts of violence from Naxalite activities over the same period—from 69 dis\u0002tricts in 2007 to just 28 in 2013 (see map 3). Eighty percent of Naxalite violence now afflicted only three states of India, down from the nine states impacted by serious Naxalite violence in 2010. On balance the tide had turned. By the end of 2014 the Naxalite insurgency was down if not out.65 In 2015, Indian joint security and economic efforts to counter the remaining Naxalite threat focused on 30 key districts in these 3 most impacted states, enabling more concentrated efforts matching gradually applied paramilitary enforcement with legal reforms and develop\u0002ment activities.66 As in the first two waves of Naxalite insurgency, the Indian federal-state government dis\u0002connect hampered its counterinsurgency efforts throughout the 2000s. Under the Indian con\u0002stitution, states bear the responsibility for enforcing law and order. When required, however, the federal government can send police and—under more limited conditions—military troops. In the case of federal police, assistance can come only upon request from the state government. In the case of military troops, assistance can come in the event of a state of emergency declara\u0002tion—as during the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency. Throughout the period from 2000 to 2010, the federal and state home (interior) ministries supervised multiple police and intelligence agencies without much unity of effort or command. An operation against Naxalite groups in the state of Bihar early in the 2000s faltered. Federal paramilitary border security forces in seven districts helped the local police, and millions of ru\u0002pees were promised in economic development opportunities. But the economic promises were broken, and poorly coordinated security operations only further alienated Naxalite moderates, derailing hoped for results by early 2002. In advance of 2004 elections in Chhattisgarh, the fed\u0002eral government sent 180 companies of paramilitary forces armed with helicopters and other advanced equipment. The Naxalites disappeared. Once the elections were over, federal troops and equipment departed and the Naxalites returned. 18 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 From the 2004 merger of Naxalite groups, the Indian government, particularly at the federal level, applied both carrots and sticks, incentivizing insurgents to pick constitutional remedies and brutally punishing those who refused. But the splits between state and federal authorities limited effectiveness. In part, state and local governments saw themselves in a co\u0002nundrum; they wanted an end to the organized Naxalite violence targeting them, their infra\u0002Map 3. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2013 19 India’s Naxalite Insurgency structure, and their legal enforcement structure. However, they did not want to alienate the vote banks across their states who sympathized with the Naxalite view of economic injustice but did not actively participate in violence. In one notable but far from unique instance, the chief minister (or governor) of the Naxalite-wracked state of Jharkhand won election in 2009 with strong insurgent sympathizer and insurgent vote bank support.67 State-level leaders de\u0002sired greater economic support from the central government, not overwhelming force, as the primary means to redress deeply held communist sympathies in their vote constituencies. Na\u0002tional political leaders within the INC empathized with these state-level concerns, offering some economic support and some additional policing support—but too little of either to make significant headway prior to 2010–2011. The politics of left-wing issues and voter concerns made effective coordination of counterinsurgency versus the Naxalites difficult. It took the extensive violence and loss of life between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate the failure of an ill-coordinated approach. In 2009 the central government signaled that it wanted to provide 80,000 paramilitary and federal police to help in the fight, but these were too slowly fed into the region without strong local coordination. From the desperation of the peak year of Naxalite (CPI-Maoist) violence in 2010, and then–Prime Minister Singh’s second declaration that Maoist violence was India’s most grave internal security threat, a combination of state\u0002level requests and federal-level policy improvements paved the way for late-arriving successes against the Naxalites.68 The path to success was also paved by corresponding Naxalite failures. Beginning in 2010, the Indian federal government finally undertook several successful ini\u0002tiatives that slowly but steadily spanned the coordination gap between federal and state security forces and linked with improved local economic development aid.69 First, the government took steps to increase the costs to Maoist insurgent group operations—both financial and physical. Second, the central government deployed an additional 66 federal paramilitary security battal\u0002ions, CPSF and others, into the field where the insurgency had been winning against small and poorly trained local police. As noted above, these came slowly and in tranches between 2010 and 2014 but reached an impressive number of more than 200,000 by early 2014.70 India’s mili\u0002tary and its special operations forces (SOF) have not participated directly in the third phase of Naxalite counterinsurgency operations. Instead, SOF units have provided indirect assistance— offering specialized training to Indian Central Armed Police Forces (see appendix B) preparing to deploy to the anti-Maoist counterinsurgency fight.71 Third, the federal government built 444 new police stations in affected areas and regenerated the policing capability in them.72 Fourth, the government established a civil development program in the worst affected areas. Finally, government security forces worked more effectively in a combined action environment where 20 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 economic development and human rights were established in the communities most vulnerable to Naxalite recruiting and propaganda.73 These five national factors interacted with several organizational failures by the Naxalites themselves. First, the Maoists failed to generate a message of systematic economic exploitation to the degree necessary for serious attention in Indian urban areas, where the gulf between rich and poor was great and growing every year. Second, despite their highly publicized violence, the Naxalites never won the “mindspace” in India; the Maoist ideology of class conflict gener\u0002ated limited appeal outside of primitive and tribal areas in India, never resonating in urban ar\u0002eas other than with a marginalized group of activist university students.74 Indian youth moved onto other causes and other areas of activism in the wider Indian economy.75 Third, Naxalites proved to be their own worst enemies. They often splintered into criminal syndicates deal\u0002ing narcotics and running both extortion and kidnapping rackets. This profiteering, evident from as early as 2009–2010, revealed that Naxalism was less about communist ideology or well-coordinated violent insurgent activity and much more about local and regional organized criminal activity, which exploits rather than benefits the lower class (and lower caste) Indian Hindus who live there.76 In self-reflective statements, ministry-level officials in the Indian federal government ac\u0002knowledged that most Naxalite gains before 2010 had come too often because local govern\u0002ments and security officials incorrectly assessed and mishandled the problems of the disgrun\u0002tled Indian minority groups in rural areas. At the same time the central government remained tepid in its involvement—unable to induce state governments to request more assertive federal security assistance and caught in a political conundrum where some of the state government leadership was both courting Naxalite sympathizer votes while simultaneously fighting Naxalite militant cadres. Once the federal government got serious and increased paramilitary security presence with a wider number of local economic development programs, the Naxalites began to wane.77 Attention to a holistic approach by the Indian central government caused the worst of the Naxalite insurgency to recede in a visible manner.78 In 2016 the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India remains a security factor, but one far from the menace publicly announced by then–Prime Minister Singh in 2006 and again in 2010.79 Instead it is now much more of a nuisance, largely a constellation of organized criminal enter\u0002prises with a loose affiliation to a Maoist credo than an ideological insurgency. The socioeco\u0002nomic factors that inspire Naxalite groups remain in place, and this insurgency could again evolve into a more serious threat to local security agents in India. In the poor eastern districts of India, the possibility of a fourth wave of Naxalite insurgency cannot be dismissed if the rich 21 India’s Naxalite Insurgency continue to get richer without the benefits of economic growth filtering down to the people who really need it.80 India’s long slog toward corralling the third phase of its Naxalite insurgency again demon\u0002strated the challenges and strengths of its counterinsurgency framework. State and local govern\u0002ment police forces must fail obviously and admit to their failures before major federal assistance can come forward. Left-wing (or communist) inspired violence mixes awkwardly with Indian electoral politics in many eastern states of the country. Communist political party voters often sympathize with Naxalite grievances but not their violent means. State and local officials thus have incentives to take uncertain and indecisive action with their police and security forces. Too often, they can tolerate incompetence and even human rights abuses by local-level counterin\u0002surgency police and militias, exacerbating wider grievances. They appeal for national economic help while avoiding national security help out of a fear that too much outside intervention might harm their local political interests. Federal-level forces, when these do arrive, come with their own issues. They can lack local knowledge and fail to be sensitive to popular culture and traditions. This leaves them vulnerable to insurgent ambush and to charges of torture or human rights abuses from an uncertain or frightened local population. U.S. Security Engagement with Indian Ministry of Home Affairs U.S. engagement with India in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has developed over a 16-year period from January 2000. This engagement has advanced along three parallel lines of interaction. One line has been through bilateral dialogue and exercises between U.S. and Indian SOF, which have focused on counterterrorism training events and conversa\u0002tions. A second line has been through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This collaboration has focused on criminal investigative techniques; port, rail, and maritime security training and best practices; and a general growth in liaison and information exchange between respective special police and border security agencies. A third line of interaction has evolved in more general bilateral military-to-military exchanges between the national armies, navies, air forces, and coast guards. Advancements in each of these areas have been noteworthy but not comprehensive. For all the noteworthy advances, limitations have remained, especially when it comes to the matter of outside assistance for Indian units and organizations conducting domestic counterinsurgency. The history of special operations training and exercising is most noteworthy. Bilateral U.S.- Indian SOF have undertaken joint exercises that work on interoperability in counterterror\u0002ism and counterinsurgency operation skills and drills. Small-scale counterterrorism training 22 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 exercises have been conducted on a recurring basis since 2002, including exercises in India’s northeast territories where longstanding domestic insurgencies continue.81 Under the broad definition of U.S.-India maritime security cooperation, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) SOF also have been training Indian military special forces officers in counterterrorism, learning from Indian counterterrorism experiences at the same time. In the main, these exercises have focused upon special techniques and capabilities for SOF activities in counterterrorism opera\u0002tions (see appendix C). Despite a decade of offers by U.S. senior commanders and defense officials, Indian leaders declined to have U.S. SOF engage with or provide direct assistance to the MHA paramilitary and police forces optimized for domestic counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations.82 But in October 2015, India, for the first time, welcomed U.S. SOF to a joint training exercise with its MHA counterterrorism unit, the National Security Guards (NSG).83 This was a meaningful step forward and, as most observers believe, became possible only after the change in perspective ac\u0002companying the government of Prime Minister Modi. Yet the limit of U.S. SOF interaction with that of only the NSG—the single special police unit focused on counterterrorism rather than counterinsurgency operations—is telling. After more than a decade of U.S. offers, the Indian government still remains uncomfortable about direct bilateral counterinsurgency training with its large array of MHA domestic counterinsurgency forces. Washington and New Delhi first established the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Work\u0002ing Group (JWG) in January 2000. Among more than a dozen major steps, the United States and India initiated antiterrorism training programs for Indian law enforcement officials and began a dialogue on cooperation in homeland and internal security.84 First, these programs involved lim\u0002ited military-to-military counterterrorism engagements. Then, after the November 2008 Mum\u0002bai terrorist attack, a more formal set of interactions between DHS and MHA counterterrorism and law enforcement officials began to take shape. Notably, however, neither of these lines of engagement have witnessed the MHA welcoming direct U.S. military or special police assistance for its special police or border police engaged in combating the Naxalite insurgency. In September 2005, USPACOM conducted a counterterrorism tabletop exercise that brought together Indian and American military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitari\u0002an assistance leaders. A U.S. National Guard unit co-trained with Indian troops at India’s Coun\u0002ter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram. U.S. antiterrorism assistance advanced again after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the commercial district of Mumbai. The U.S. Department of State’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) provided enhanced training 23 India’s Naxalite Insurgency consultations with senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials on the topics of hotel security, rail security, responses to an active shooter incident, as well as major event security management.85 In 2010, the two governments began the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Since then the dialogue has enabled bilateral cooperation on mutual strategic interests and strengthened “security cooperation through expanded dialogues and exercises as well as shar\u0002ing of advanced technologies.”86 A subsequent 2010 U.S.-India Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative allows the United States to facilitate capacity-building and training in India across a number of specific areas, including but not limited to: ■ developing investigative skills ■ promoting cooperation between forensic science laboratories ■ establishing procedures to provide mutual investigative assistance ■ improving capabilities to act against money-laundering, counterfeit currency, and terrorist financing ■ trading best practices on mass transit and rail security ■ increasing interactions between coast guards and navies on maritime security ■ exchanging experience and expertise on port and border security ■ enhancing liaison and training between specialist counterterrorism units, including the National Security Guard and its U.S. counterparts.87 Beginning in February 2012, American trainers under the ATA have been training Indian police in cooperation with the MHA. This training includes forensic examination of terrorist crime scenes and advanced explosives incident countermeasures. These courses are also available to state police, for example, in Kolkata (West Bengal). Intelligence agencies of both countries are sharing resources to support specific counterterrorism operations.88 These training courses have had a positive impact upon hundreds of Indian local and national police, including IPS. They have also engaged some members of the MHA special police units such as the Indo-Tibetan Bor\u0002der Police and CPSF. Noteworthy and prudent, these bits of individual training have occurred 24 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 with individual Indian police and paramilitary officers and jawans (junior paramilitary soldiers) who have later participated in counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites and other rebel groups.89 At the same time, though, direct U.S. military engagement with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and security forces units involved in domestic counterinsurgency has remained limited. American military interactions with regular Indian army units also have grown in an im\u0002pressive manner over the past decade. As discussed earlier, Indian, just as American, military and defense leaders are keen to state that India has more joint military training events and exer\u0002cises with the United States than with any other defense partner worldwide.90 Yet India’s civilian defense establishment leadership appears amenable to many military-to-military training and exercise interactions with the United States but continues to view access to military technology to be the litmus test of fruitful bilateral defense relations.91 Although the Indian military highly prizes joint service-to-service interactions and exer\u0002cises, no U.S. military units have been engaged with or even indirectly assisted Indian central police or paramilitary units directly involved in the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the Naxalites. In those instances in which the U.S. military and DHS per\u0002sonnel have had interaction with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and paramilitary forces, the rule has been that indirect general skills training is acceptable for Indian leadership, but specific engagement and activities directly with Indian domestic insurgency forces is alto\u0002gether something else. Some analysts have recommended that the United States formally inject direct domestic counterinsurgency assistance into the U.S.-India security relationship. In 2013, one such ana\u0002lyst, Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, made a robust proposal, stating that the United States should formally generate a $400 million India counterinsurgency initiative, jointly run by the Depart\u0002ment of Defense (DOD), State, and DHS.92 He proposed that this initiative should bundle to\u0002gether the indirect assistance provided by the ATA and DOD International Military Education and Training program, as well as establish a Foreign Military Finance Account for India (where one then did not exist) and apportion other money into DHS and Justice department accounts to better enable Federal Bureau of Information resources for its India-focused international po\u0002lice training program. In this well-intentioned recommendation, U.S. largesse could be used to provide vital equipment to India’s CRPF, including armored personnel vehicles, mine-resistant vehicles, flak jackets, GPS trackers, and night-vision goggles. As Indian attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deemed vital for providing counterinsurgency ground 25 India’s Naxalite Insurgency support, this proposal provided for U.S. funding to assist the Indian air force in creating dedi\u0002cated air surveillance and support for the CRPF—including helicopter and UAV support.93 Noble in intent, Mullick’s recommendation of a major U.S. push to provide direct assis\u0002tance to Indian domestic counterinsurgency units and operations remains as misguided today as it was in 2013. Likewise, periodic offers by U.S. defense officials of direct U.S. military assis\u0002tance to Indian counterinsurgency forces are similarly well intentioned but off target.94 These and similar initiatives ultimately push unhelpfully against Indian protection of its absolute sov\u0002ereignty in domestic counterinsurgency operations. Moreover, even if India were to unexpect\u0002edly welcome direct U.S. military and whole-of-government support for its domestic counter\u0002insurgency activities, that very success would create significant problems for the growing but delicate U.S.-India security relationship. These problems are evident in the patterns observed during Indian counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites. Direct American support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations (such as those against the Naxalites) would quickly expose significant divergence between views in Washington and Indian cultural and political concerns with its domestic insurgents. First, In\u0002dians are historically tolerant of long, protracted counterinsurgency operations, including the four-and-a-half-decade Naxalite rebellion, a six-decade swirl of insurgency in northeast India, and the insurgency and rebellion extant in Jammu and Kashmir since 1947. American patience with such protracted counterinsurgency operations has not been a hallmark of its international ventures over the past century. Second, Indian domestic insurgencies have a political cadence and rhythm about them that is alien to American sensibilities. In all three phases of the Naxalite insurgency, state and local political dynamics played to Naxalite sympathizer vote banks, allowing insurgent activi\u0002ties to grow to an uncomfortable level. In the second phase and especially the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency, Indian national police and paramilitary assistance began with limited but targeted security help for local authorities that focused upon managing major events—like election security—but then quickly vanished. Only when the political calculus of local, state, and national officials aligned did coordinated and effective policing, paramilitary, and local as\u0002sistance programs come together. American patience with the dynamics of this Indian political rhythm would be sorely tried. Third, with much of India’s Naxalite insurgency featuring organized criminal activity as its underpinning by 2014–2016, it is arguably more useful and feasible for the United States and India to focus meaningful collaboration on individual policing techniques and investigative activities to counter these dimensions of residual Naxalism. There will be less Indian resistance 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 to this kind of DHS-to-MHA support. Thereafter, the focus of the U.S. military and its SOF can then better orient on wider regional and international counterterrorism activities. In addition to these historically supported cautions, direct American training and equip\u0002ment support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations might run afoul of U.S. legisla\u0002tive mandates and human rights standards. All U.S. assistance to foreign security forces must conform to what is known as the Leahy Law, named for legislative author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). One part of the law applies to State Department foreign assistance programs and the second applies to DOD training and assistance programs for the security forces of a foreign country. Both versions prohibit any U.S. security assistance if the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense have credible information that a military, paramilitary, or police unit of a foreign government has committed a gross violation of human rights in the conduct of its activities— past or present. The law allows for an exception (or waiver) permitting resumption of security assistance if the Secretary of State or Defense reports to Congress that the government of the assisted country is taking effective steps to bring the violating members of the security forces to justice.95 Direct U.S. assistance to India’s paramilitary and police units combatting the Naxalite insurgency (as others) could quickly run into a problem with the Leahy Law. There have been frequent reports of Indian local police units’ involvement in human rights violations against innocents in the Naxalite insurgency areas.96 Indian central policy forces, including units from the CRPF, have been accused of human rights abuses and torture against apprehended militants and presumed supporters in Naxalite-afflicted areas.97 It is hard to imagine Indian pride react\u0002ing well to American demands for certification of the human rights corrections made on its national counterinsurgency paramilitary forces. It also is hard to imagine the U.S.-India security relationship holding up well if, in order to secure training and equipment for its already well-supported national paramilitary units, New Delhi must face repetitive Leahy Law inquiries. Indeed, in a country with growing wealth and a proud belief in the relative successes of its autonomous, indigenous paramilitary counterin\u0002surgency forces, U.S. direct assistance (with strings) is not likely to be well received.98 At the least, such conditioned assistance would strain security relations that both sides desire to see improve. At the worst, the outcome might set back bilateral security progress on far more im\u0002portant U.S.-India security initiatives including those involving joint maritime security activi\u0002ties in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence sharing and broader operations. 27 India’s Naxalite Insurgency Lessons Learned and Policy Implications for U.S.-India Relations A review of the history of Indian approach to dealing with its Naxalite insurgency indi\u0002cates the unique nature of New Delhi’s approach to domestic security. The limited engagement with the United States on military and security assistance offers also indicates the continuing barriers inhibiting a deep and unbridled bilateral security alliance at this time. A decade of U.S. interaction with India on the Naxalite insurgency reinforces the notion that Washington should not expect New Delhi to become a tightly coupled military ally anytime soon. Instead, New Del\u0002hi is more likely to be a friendly strategic partner with the United States where mutual security interests align, while interacting more often in a restrained and limited manner where U.S. and Indian security interests and prerogatives do not well align—as in the case of the Naxalites.99 Given this insight, U.S. policymakers should focus on bilateral counterterrorism and coun\u0002terinsurgency security cooperation efforts toward externally sponsored Islamist terrorist groups and, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, against actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns. As a complement, U.S. military assistance programs focusing on technical skills and practices for individual Indian police, paramilitary, and SOF will remain most promising and prominent for the foreseeable future. 28 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Appendix A.

Under the reciprocal agreement, both New Delhi and Washington would have the ability, but not the obligation, to assist each other’s armed forces with simple military logistics. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India.

On May 22, there were nearly simultaneous bombings of two movie theaters in New Delhi by a Sikh terrorist organization, Babbar Khalsa International, which many thought was defunct. The attacks left 1 person dead and more than 60 injured. On October 29, a series of explosions in crowded marketplaces and on a public bus in New Delhi killed approximately 60 and injured more than 150 on the eve of Diwali, India’s most important Hindu holiday. The Indian government blamed the designated foreign terrorist organiza\u0002tion Lashkar e-Tayyiba for the attack.

But it also came about after Naxalite groups began to focus on controlling areas rich in natural resources such as iron and destroying state infrastructure such as railroads, telephone exchanges, and industrial plants. By 2010 Naxalite presence overlapped critical areas such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Orissa, which contain the bulk of India’s iron ore, and Andhra Pradesh has large reserves of bauxite, 38 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 key inputs to Indian industry. Naxalites had also come to dominate areas containing 85 percent of the country’s coal resources, which are used to power 55 percent of India’s energy supply and 75 percent of its electricity. These economic realities made piecemeal solutions and state-level toleration of Naxalite activities untenable—driving better coordination. See “Left Wing Extremism (LWE) Division,” available at.

Most recently, U.S. congressional conditionality on the Kerry-Berman-Lugar strategic assistance package to Pakistan of 2009 requiring that Pakistan’s military relinquish absolute control of its general officer selection process to civilian oversight substantially strained U.S.-Pakistan relations at a moment that Washington aimed to make them tighter. India in 2016 is not Pakistan of 2009, but the caution against unhelpful conditionality remains a worthy one. See S. 1707, “Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009,” 111th Cong., 1st sess.

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

The two neighbouring countries share the world’s longest [unmarked land border](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/23/india-china-border-skirmishes/). They fought a full fledge war in 1962 and are engaged in sporadic skirmishes since then. Recent military incidents have come to the fore again after a relatively long period of quiet. Tensions have spiked, and in a more recent incident, [20 Indian soldiers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476) were killed in a scuffle that broke out between the two sides, flaring the tension to an unprecedented level and risking a major escalation between the two regional powers. The conflict started when on May 5, a [clash](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/tense-india-china-standoff-himalayan-border-escalate-200527120501581.html) took place between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh area at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) due to Indian intrusion and patrolling in Chinese claimed border territory. Apparently these clashes stalked from contradictory assessments of the demarcation of border itself, but the intrusion did not remain limited to one time and point. On May 9, Indian soldiers repeated the same activity which was checked by the Chinese soldiers and both sides got engaged in yet another brawling contest. Extension of skirmishes to another two to three locations was followed by military buildup in order to gear up responses. The expansion of these brawls at multiple places indicate that Indian Army has been pushing China rather than trying to calm down the situation. [Modi’s meeting](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/india-china-face-off-pm-modi-meets-nsa-chiefs-of-service-staff) with his like-minded national security team earlier also indicated the seriousness of the situation. In response, Chinese foreign ministry also vowed to safeguard its territorial integrity at all costs. Both sides have had military level talks to reduce the tensions but have not been able to restore peace. Going back to [1988 Sino-Indian deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93India_relations), which fostered some kind of tranquility promoting economic linkages and activities; outstanding issue of border demarcation was left unresolved. [Statistically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_GDP_of_China) the two countries were near equals on the world stage at that time; however, material balance of power between the two countries has dramatically changed since then. India has been on a steady path of rising economy but on relative terms its growth has considerably declined. Currently both nations are also engaged in a security dilemma directly and indirectly both. India has always been aspiring to take a lead role in the region and occupy a singular dominant position and this quest was aptly bolstered and fueled by the US in the light of US Grand Strategy for the region. India has exercised unilateral [political influence](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) with most countries while exercising lopsided treaty relations; Pakistan and Afghanistan being exception to this. In the last seventy years, it has annexed Sikkim; carried out military interventions in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh and Bhutan; coerced them with threats of war; and [interfered](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) in their domestic affairs. Nepal has recently been [victimized](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2019/12/20/nepal-a-victim-of-legacy-of-british-colonial-times/) as Indian authorities have released a political map showing 35 kilometers of Nepalese area as part of India. Continuous and unprovoked violations of the cease fire at Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan also reflect pursuits to keep the borders volatile. The regional situation started to change in 2010s, when China grew in [economic power](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/decade-china-west-china-ascent) disturbing existent stalemate. China with its persistent progress has increased its footprint in South Asia with far more friendly relations based on inclusivity, equality and mutual interests unlike Indian coercive strategy. In the last decade, while economic linkages between India and China have grown exponentially, their [political and military relations](https://southasianvoices.org/maintaining-the-spirit-in-2020-reflecting-on-2019-india-china-relations/) have remained tense amidst China’s growing power affording it proportionate say in the regional affairs. The increasing influence has come with a cost of offending India. India’s [foreign policy goals](https://thediplomat.com/2016/12/indias-connect-central-asia-policy-2/) are centered on enhancing its economic and political influence in Asia and around the world. India has been seeking to expand its commerce and trade through India’s North-South Transport Corridor ( [INSTC](http://polarconnection.org/india-instc-nordic-arctic/)) connecting India to Russia, Central Asian countries, Baltic, Nordic and Arctic regions. As Belt and Road Initiative [(BRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) has been expanding with considerable gains for China, India views it as a threat to its endeavors. The US planned [exit from Afghanistan](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-time-us-troops-exit-afghanistan-undermining-agreement/story?id=70908619) is emerging as another challenge adding to India’s frustrations. US diminishing interest and influence in Afghanistan will directly affect India’s goal of regional hegemony. For US, ensuring pro-Indian government and sustained internal stability in Afghanistan are critical factors in cementing Indian influence in the region, which so far seems to be a distinct possibility despite India’s ongoing efforts. Modi’s domestic policies are also taking toll.Abrogation of [Article 370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation_of_the_special_status_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir) and [crackdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-28/india-s-kashmir-crackdown-is-damaging-its-image-overseas) along with burgeoning atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir, enactment of controversial Citizenship Act and unprecedented violence against minorities especially Muslims are clear manifestation of India’s Supremacist approach with roots in Hindutva. Failure to control and cover these atrocities has also added to the frustrations. India is in a denial mode to accept China’s power and is feeling threatened. Indians see Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative as an [encirclement campaign](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20180420_R45194_3d4bf676130e76924f5fea6d2e54d3a78e2200a9.pdf), given how determinedly China has been building its presence in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and other points along the Indian Ocean. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s [Act East policy](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/24861/how-modi-is-broadening-the-range-and-scope-of-india-s-act-east-policy) and the increasing US emphasis on the Indo-Pacific has created a framework for better cooperation thus making India an energeticfriend at a time when many of America’s traditional allies are going [grey](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-06-11/great-demographics-comes-great-power). These actions of India are manifestation of its quest to counter Chinese influence using all possible means tacitly emboldened by US. While both countries have scaled up their military presence in the border region, any military confrontation is likely to bring devastation to the region as a whole. While new cold war is echoing, US desire to use India as countervailing power to China is also inspiring Modi in his quests. The Indian expansionist ambitions coupled with Modi’s self-induced internal strife may stretch India beyond its capacity. China has asked India to be careful not to include the [US factor](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190096.shtml) in its handling of any problem in its relation with China. Accordingly, going forward, either India would have to recognize the new reality and accept an end of its regional domination; or, it would have to find a more [even-keel approach](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) in its bilateral relationship with Beijing to make the latter’s forays into the region unprofitable. India simultaneously is playing the upper hand in the occupied Kashmir by carrying out unabated atrocities and offensive military posturing along the LoC. Evermore than before, India itself is trying to create a two front war situation while world powers like US, EU, Middle East are already grappling with their domestic issues. Any conflagration between the three nuclear states in the region (China, India and Pakistan) is a doomsday scenario and has the potential to engulf the region beyond South Asia. Indian decision-making elite are badly suffering from narcissism and they exude an aura of idiosyncratic populism. Confusion is prevailing and any incorrect and incoherent decision would be detrimental once it is seen in the overall strategic equation punctuated with COVID-19, economic regression and an emerging new world order. India needs to open her eyes to evade the pitfall before it is too late. Pakistan and China must play their role in a sagacious and pragmatic manner while ensuring safety and security of their nations and region alike. - [Asia](https://strafasia.com/tag/asia/) - [China](https://strafasia.com/tag/china/) - [India](https://strafasia.com/tag/india/) - [indo-china](https://strafasia.com/tag/indo-china/) - [nuclear](https://strafasia.com/tag/nuclear/) - [Strafasia](https://strafasia.com/tag/strafasia/) About Fida Hussain Malik [2 Articles](https://strafasia.com/author/fidahussainmalik/) Fida Hussain Malik who is a Islamabad based defense analyst and an author of several books on diverse topics. ### Related Articles Analysis ### [The Other Side of the Nuclear Coin](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/) [27th May 2020](https://strafasia.com/2020/05/)[Zeeshan Hayat](https://strafasia.com/author/zeeshanhayat/)[Analysis](https://strafasia.com/category/analysis/), [Environment](https://strafasia.com/category/environment/), [Nuclear](https://strafasia.com/category/security/nuclear/), [Politics](https://strafasia.com/category/politics/), [Security](https://strafasia.com/category/security/)[1](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/#comments) [Print PDF](https://strafasia.com/strafasia.com) Print PDF The advent of fission in 1938 – a process in which an atom, bombarded with neutron is split into two or more parts with the release of a large amount of energy – [\\[…\\]](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/) Analysis ### [Nuclear Deterrence and Stability in South Asia: Perceptions and Realities](https://strafasia.com/nuclear-deterrence-and-stability-in-south-asia-perceptions-and-realities/) [26th August 2021](https://strafasia.com/2021/08/)[Mahvish Malik](https://strafasia.com/author/mahvishmalik/)[Analysis](https://strafasia.com/category/analysis/), [Economy](https://strafasia.com/category/economy/), [Emerging Technologies](https://strafasia.com/category/security/emerging-technologies/), [Military](https://strafasia.com/category/security/military/), [Missiles](https://strafasia.com/category/security/missiles/), [Nuclear](https://strafasia.com/category/security/nuclear/), [Politics](https://strafasia.com/category/politics/), [Security](https://strafasia.com/category/security/), [Technology](https://strafasia.com/category/technology/)[0](https://strafasia.com/nuclear-deterrence-and-stability-in-south-asia-perceptions-and-realities/#respond) [Print PDF](https://strafasia.com/strafasia.com) Print PDF Pakistani and Indian nuclear capabilities are the key pillars for ensuring peace and security in the region – duly acknowledged by the two states in 2004.

Firewall data accessed by TOI reveals that NMC's web servers endured over 2,000 intrusion attacks within just 24 hours — most of them high-severity — aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in municipal web applications hosting critical public services and citizen data.Confirming the development, a senior NMC official said the civic body provides multiple online services through its website (nmcnagpur.gov.in) and My Nagpur app, offering citizens access to property tax management, water bill payments, birth and death certificates, and lodging grievances. \"These platforms aim to offer convenient, timely, and transparent access to civic services — from online applications to complaint tracking. However, the threat of cyberattacks always looms,\" the official admitted.According to the report generated by NMC's XGS138 firewall system, there were 2,008 hacking attempts — almost entirely targeted at server-side applications, the backbone of online property tax payments, grievance redressal portals, and essential data systems. Of these, 1,068 were categorised as major and 907 as critical, a volume cybersecurity experts describe as \"an organised and sustained digital assault.\"Among the most common intrusion attempts were 838 attacks seeking access to the system's /etc/passwd file, a sensitive location containing encrypted user account information. The firewall also logged 111 attempts to exploit the notorious Apache Log4j vulnerability — a global exploit capable of granting remote server control — along with multiple probes directed at Atlassian Confluence and Sonatype Nexus, platforms commonly used for document and content management.Cybersecurity analysts suggest that the attack signatures indicate a botnet-driven reconnaissance campaign, likely testing NMC's defences for weak points. \"Such large-scale automated attacks are not random. They are part of continuous efforts by cybercriminal networks to infiltrate public-sector servers where data is valuable and often poorly protected,\" said a senior cybersecurity researcher familiar with municipal systems.The firewall log identifies two foreign IP addresses — 104.248.99.110 and 167.99.28.249 — traced to servers in Singapore, as the source of nearly all attack traffic. Fortunately, NMC's intrusion prevention system successfully dropped all malicious packets, preventing any breaches. However, experts warn that this may only be a prelude to more targeted, sophisticated attempts.A single compromised server, experts note, could expose massive amounts of sensitive data — including property records, tax receipts, employee information, and internal correspondence. Moreover, disruption to NMC's web services could paralyse online grievance systems, permit applications, and sanitation or water dashboards, directly impacting lakhs of citizens.The incident underscores the urgent need for a robust cybersecurity overhaul across NMC departments. Officials must initiate a comprehensive forensic audit, verify patch levels of all web-facing applications, and immediately secure systems vulnerable to Log4j and Confluence exploits. Regular testing, network segmentation, and staff training on digital hygiene are now essential measures, not optional ones.The NMC is preparing to conduct a comprehensive IT security audit that will cover not only its in-house software, servers, and hardware but also extend to all private service providers engaged in NMC operations. The audit will focus on detecting leaks, ensuring timely patching, and strengthening monitoring mechanisms to safeguard civic data.In an era when public services rely heavily on digital infrastructure, this cyberattack serves as a wake-up call. Nagpur's municipal websites are no longer mere administrative tools — they are the nervous system of urban governance. Protecting them is not just a technical imperative but a public duty. Unless the NMC acts swiftly to fortify its digital defences, the next attack may not be just a warning — it could be a breach. _[Get an chance to win ₹5000 Amazon Voucher by taking part in India's Biggest Habit Index!

Over 50,000 clips were stolen and sold online, affecting 80 systems nationwide. This highlights critical cybersecurity lapses, with investigations ongoing despite arrests. RAJKOT: A shocking cybercrime has rocked India’s digital security landscape, with hackers stealing at least 50,000 CCTV clips over nine months from facilities across the country and selling them online for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000 per clip, feeding them into an international porn fetish network for profit.Investigators revealed that 80 CCTV dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and more. Horror In Coimbatore: Student Gang Raped After Abduction, Three Accused Shot And Arrested By Police The scam came to light when teaser clips from Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot appeared on YouTube channels like “Megha Mbbs” and “cp monda”, leading customers to Telegram groups where the stolen footage was sold. Officials said the breaches were made possible by default passwords such as “admin123”, enabling hackers to launch automated attacks and collect massive amounts of sensitive footage.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ‘admin123’, which had not been changed during setup. This enabled the hackers to initiate an aggressive and automated assault.An officer from the cybercrime branch in Ahmedabad told TOI: “The primary method used was a ‘brute force attack’ (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).” Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this.“First, Dhameliya used a website called suIP.biz to obtain the IP addresses (the unique online location) of cameras in Gujarat. These IPs were then fed into a software called ‘Masscan’ which quickly scanned for open ports (the specific digital doorways that allow remote communication).”Next, the attackers used a specialized hacking tool called ‘SWC software’, which can reveal a camera’s ID, password, and IP address once the system is compromised. Using these stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya — later arrested in Delhi and who had posed as a medical laboratory technology diploma holder — accessed the hospital’s cameras through the DMSS application, a tool normally used for legitimate remote viewing.The officer added, “To access this sensitive footage cost around Rs 700 per person, though the highest-demand voyeuristic clips sold for up to Rs. 4,000. Praj Patil, also a NEET aspirant, acted as the financial facilitator, providing his mobile number and bank account to collect subscription payments.” To conceal their location, the attackers relied heavily on international infrastructure, routing their activities through virtual private networks (VPNs) that made their origins appear to be in cities like Bucharest in Romania, and New York in the US.The massive scale of unauthorized access — exceeding 11,000 successful external sessions in total — was meticulously tracked through log files spanning from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024. The core members, including Prajwal Teli, Praj Patil, and Chandraprakash Phoolchand, were arrested within 39 hours of the FIR being registered.

This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment. In this challenging and uncertain environment, we have downgraded our growth projections. We are now forecasting that global growth will decline from 3.3% in 2024 to a modest 2.9% in 2025 and in 2026. Weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception. Lower growth and less trade will hit incomes and slow job growth. Although inflation has recently declined in most countries, service price inflation remains stubbornly sticky and goods price inflation has increased slightly in many countries due to rising food prices. Protectionism is adding to these inflationary pressures, and inflation expectations have risen substantially in several countries. And even though we are still forecasting that inflation will come down to central bank targets by 2026 in most countries, it will now take longer to reach those targets. In the countries more affected by tariffs, inflation might even rise first before coming down. Risks have risen significantly too. There is the risk that protectionism and trade policy uncertainty will increase even further and that additional trade barriers might be introduced. According to our simulations, additional tariffs would further reduce global growth prospects and fuel inflation, dampening global growth even more. Fiscal risks are also increasing. Public debt levels are already elevated in many advanced and emerging market economies and spending pressures are rising in areas such as defence, investing in the green transition and costs related to the ageing of our societies. Debt service costs are rising too, further increasing pressures on public finances. High debt levels and tighter financial conditions pose particular risks for developing countries, many of which have large debt refinancing needs in the near future. Historically elevated equity valuations also increase the vulnerability to negative shocks in financial markets. In this context, policy has a crucial role to play to tackle uncertainty and boost growth. First and foremost, it is essential to avoid further trade fragmentation and trade barriers. Agreements to ease trade tensions and lower tariffs and other trade barriers will be instrumental to revive growth and investment and avoid rising prices. This is by far the most important policy priority. Second, given the recent inflationary pressures, monetary policy should remain vigilant. Still, if trade tensions are not intensified and inflation expectations remain anchored, policy rates can be reduced if inflation is projected to decline or remain subdued. Third, restoring fiscal discipline is key for countries to avoid fiscal sustainability problems and build buffers for future shocks. Given high debt levels and tremendous spending pressures, countries should ensure 10  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 that public debt is, indeed, on a sustainable path. Clear and credible medium-term fiscal plans are needed to show how countries intend to address pressures on public finances. Thus, reducing non-essential or inefficient expenditures by undertaking periodic spending reviews, targeting of policies, as well as raising revenues by reforming tax systems or broadening tax bases, are key policy instruments to help ensure fiscal sustainability. Finally, boosting investment will be instrumental to revive our economies and improve public finances. As we demonstrate in our special chapter, investment has been too low since the global financial crisis. Sluggish investment has lowered growth, productivity, and living standards. Business investment has fallen not only due to uncertainty and weakened demand, but also due to structural factors. This includes declining competitive pressures and financing frictions that have become more evident as a higher share of investment has been devoted to intangible assets (such as software, R&D, etc). At the same time, housing investment has been too feeble to avoid a substantial decline in housing affordability in many countries. And public investment has also been too weak for too long in many economies. In this Outlook, we provide recommendations for countries to foster investment and growth, including reforms enhancing competition and cutting regulatory costs, increasing public investment in energy, digital and critical infrastructures, addressing skills shortages and skills mismatches, and speeding up construction permits and licenses, as well as easing zoning and planning restrictions and rental regulations, to spur housing supply. All in all, in the current context, governments should work together to tackle uncertainty and pursue reforms to foster growth and jobs. Trade agreements to resolve existing tensions and lower or eliminate barriers should be accompanied by more efforts to enhance multilateral cooperation. Governments also need to tackle domestic challenges to boost growth and durably raise living standards, by fostering business and public investment and by pursuing productivity-enhancing structural reforms to improve the competitiveness of their economies. Policy has a crucial role to play in these challenging and uncertain times. 3 June 2025 Álvaro Pereira OECD Chief Economist  11 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Introduction The global outlook is becoming increasingly challenging. Substantial increases in barriers to trade, tighter financial conditions, weaker business and consumer confidence and heightened policy uncertainty will all have marked adverse effects on growth prospects if they persist. Higher trade costs, especially in countries raising tariffs, will also push up inflation, although their impact will be offset partially by weaker commodity prices. Global GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and in 2026 (Table 1.1), on the technical assumption that tariff rates as of mid-May are sustained despite ongoing legal challenges. The slowdown is concentrated in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with China and other economies expected to see smaller downward adjustments. Growth through 2025 is expected to be especially weak, with global output rising by just over 2½ per cent over the year to the fourth quarter, and by only 1.1% in the United States. Global trade growth is likely to slow substantially over the next two years, after significant front-loading ahead of expected tariff increases, and uncertainty is expected to hold back business investment. Fiscal easing will provide support in a handful of economies notably in China and Germany, where higher defence and infrastructure spending in 2026 could generate a significant upturn, but policy is likely to be mildly restrictive in many other countries. Annual headline inflation in the G20 economies is collectively expected to moderate from 6.2% to 3.6% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026, but the United States is an important exception, with annual inflation expected to rise to just under 4% by the end of 2025 and remain above target in 2026. There are substantial risks to these projections, with the scale and duration of the expected downturn remaining highly uncertain. Further increases or swift changes in trade barriers, including through retaliatory actions, as well as more cautious behaviour by consumers and firms, or continued risk repricing in financial markets could all intensify the growth slowdown and trigger significant disruptions in highly interlinked cross-border supply chains. Rising inflation expectations by households could prolong inflationary pressures, especially in economies facing substantially higher trade costs or with still-tight labour markets, prompting more restrictive monetary policy and weakening growth prospects. Financial stability risks from still richly-valued and concentrated equity markets and high corporate financing needs could be triggered by additional risk repricing and amplified by forced asset sales by highly-leveraged non-bank financial intermediaries. On the upside, a reversal of the increase in trade barriers would support growth and reduce inflation, even if it did not immediately result in lower policy uncertainty. Steps to ease regulatory burdens, and an early resolution to conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, could also improve confidence and incentives to invest. 1. General assessment of the macroeconomic situation 12  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Against this backdrop, the key policy priorities are to ensure a lasting decline in trade tensions, policy uncertainty and inflation, establish a credible fiscal path to debt sustainability while providing temporary support to those vulnerable to economic shocks, and implement ambitious reforms to strengthen growth prospects and improve competitiveness. • Countries need to find ways of working together within the global trading system and to make trade policy more predictable. Agreements to ease trade tensions or potentially lower existing trade barriers would be welcome, improve policy certainty and strengthen the prospects for investment and growth. Steps to lower tariffs, deepen trade agreements or reduce barriers to trade in services would also benefit productivity and living standards. Key areas where opportunities exist for services trade reforms include further improvements in trade facilitation, reductions in regulatory barriers that impede access to national markets, and initiatives to enhance the cross-border digital delivery of services. • Central banks should remain vigilant given heightened uncertainty and the potential for initial increases in trade costs to push up wage and price pressures more generally. The balance of risks for central banks will vary across countries, with the downside effects of higher uncertainty and weaker exports likely to be the key influences on policy decisions in most countries, but upside inflationary pressures being a more pertinent concern in countries raising tariffs. Provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, and trade tensions do not intensify further, policy rate reductions should continue in economies in which underlying inflation is projected to moderate or remain subdued. • Faced with multiple spending pressures, governments need to ensure long-term debt sustainability and maintain the ability to react to future shocks. Stronger efforts to contain and reallocate spending and enhance revenues, set within credible medium-term country-specific adjustment paths, will be essential for debt burdens to remain manageable and to conserve the resources required to address longer term spending challenges. Higher debt service costs and some pressing spending needs, such as plans to raise defence spending substantially, are already forcing hard choices in some countries about the pace and composition of fiscal adjustment and limiting room for budgetary manoeuvre. In the near term, the automatic fiscal stabilisers should be allowed to operate fully to help cushion the adverse impact of trade tensions and elevated uncertainty. Targeted and well-designed support measures may also be needed to help companies but should be only temporary, as structural policy solutions are key if the adverse effects on external competitiveness are likely to endure. • Rising protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty and weak growth prospects reinforce the need for ambitious structural policy reforms that strengthen living standards and promote economic competitiveness. A strong focus should be placed on policies to revive business investment, innovation and labour productivity, particularly ones that have a limited near-term fiscal cost. Elevated policy uncertainty, declining business dynamism and perceived difficulties in funding future investment in intangible assets are factors that need to be addressed in many OECD economies to strengthen investment growth.  13 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Table 1.1. Global GDP growth is projected to slow StatLink 2https://stat.link/57dr8i Recent Developments Global growth has been resilient but trade policy changes raise new challenges After finishing 2024 on a sound footing, global GDP growth eased in the first quarter of 2025 (Figure 1.1, Panel A). However, economic developments were obscured by some front-loading of purchases ahead of the introduction of announced tariff rate increases. In the advanced economies, economic growth turned negative in the United States and Japan, but this was largely due to a surge in goods imports, with indicators of domestic demand growth holding up in both economies. Real GDP also contracted in the first quarter in Korea and several European economies, including Portugal, Norway, Slovenia, Denmark and Hungary. In contrast, output growth strengthened in Germany and the United Kingdom, partly reflecting stronger export growth, and remained solid in Spain and Ireland. Most emerging-market economies generally continued to expand at a solid pace in the first quarter of 2025. In China, growth slowed a little but remained resilient, supported by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and rapid export growth. There were also ongoing expansions in India, Indonesia and several Latin American economies, including Chile and Colombia. In Mexico, output growth picked up, helped by an improvement in agricultural output following weather-related disruptions in late 2024.

These policy changes have coincided with a marked increase in newspaper-based measures of trade policy uncertainty (Figure 1.1, Panel B). As of mid-May, the United States had raised the tariff rate on most merchandise imports from China by 30% points, with China raising its tariff rate on merchandise imports from the United States by 10% points. Both countries had bilateral tariff rates of about 21% at the start of the year (Bown, 2025). The new rates are significantly below the peak bilateral tariff rates announced in April, which exceeded 100%, but it remains possible that those higher rates could be reinstated later this year. In addition, tariffs have been announced on those United States imports from Canada and Mexico not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, with Canada taking targeted retaliatory action in response. The United States has also imposed a default tariff increase of 10 percentage points on all other trading partners, with the possibility that many countries could face substantially higher tariffs from July 2025. Certain products have been excluded from these increases, including United States imports of automobiles and automobile parts and steel and aluminium products, which face a separate tariff of 25%. Ongoing legal challenges bring additional uncertainty on some of these tariff measures. Taken together, the new tariffs introduced by the United States this year up to mid-May are estimated to have raised the (ex-ante) effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports to 15.4%, from just over 2% in 2024, taking it to the highest rate since 1938 (Box 1.1).1 The US tariffs, together with retaliatory action by China, as well as more limited action by Canada, means that trade equivalent to over 2% of world GDP is now directly facing higher tariffs, pointing to much greater disruption than during the US-China trade tensions in 2018-19. If current applied tariffs are sustained, effective tariff rates are likely to fall over time, as trade in more heavily-tariffed goods is likely to slow. Figure 1.1. Global growth was holding up ahead of recent trade policy announcements Note: In Panel B, data are standardised from January 1960.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/cieo1r 1 Effective tariff rates weight the rise in a given tariff line with the share those imports constitute; for the purposes of these calculations 2024 US Census Bureau data are used.  15 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Higher bilateral tariff rates are a drag on global activity and add to trade costs, raising the price of covered imported final goods for consumers and intermediate inputs for businesses, particularly in countries where tariffs are imposed. The initial effect on prices is likely to be felt close to the time of the tariffs being implemented, with the full impacts on output growth taking longer to materialise. Tariffs raise revenues for the government imposing them, but may also create distortions. The use of these additional revenues will condition the size and distribution of the economic impacts. At the same time, the expected slowing in economic growth in countries imposing tariffs will reduce other tax revenues. The impacts of recent trade policy changes may be more pronounced given heightened policy uncertainty, with elevated caution by businesses and consumers further weighing on investment and consumption growth.2 Taken together, higher tariffs and heightened uncertainty would be expected to weaken trade activity, although there is an upside risk in the very near term if exporters further bring forward trade to try and avoid the possibility of reciprocal or sectoral tariff rates being raised further in the next 2-3 months. Box 1.1. The impact of US tariff policy changes will be significant This box outlines the main tariff changes implemented by the United States, the impact on the effective tariff rates across countries and the goods trade that might be affected. The Box reflects the tariffs applied as of mid-May, despite some uncertainty pertaining to ongoing legal challenges. The extent of recent tariff changes from the United States and China is significantly larger than the previous episode of US-China trade tensions in 2018, with new tariff increases covering a broader range of goods. Even though bilateral goods trade between the United States and China has declined as a share of their total trade since 2018, it still represented around 2.5% of world goods trade in 2023 according to the OECD Balanced International Merchandise Trade dataset. Taking into account zero-rated items as well as tariffs on United States imports from other countries, trade equivalent to 2.2% of world GDP will be affected by the new tariffs (Figure 1.2, Panel A). In 2024, according to US data, China accounted for 6.9% of the United States’ merchandise exports, and 13.3% of US merchandise imports. As a result of the combined trade policy changes introduced since January this year, the average effective tariff from the United States will rise to historically high levels, based on 2024 import patterns (Figure 1.2, Panel B). US imports of cars and car parts, and steel and aluminium products are now subject to an additional 25% tariff. In addition, tariffs have been raised on all countries by the United States, but with some sectoral and product exemptions. Collectively, the distribution of these tariff increases, as of mid-May, differs widely by country (Figure 1.2, Panel C). • Announced tariff increases have been highest for China, at 30%. • Canada and Mexico also face higher tariffs, but a different tariff regime. They do not qualify for the exemptions granted to other countries, but rather face tariffs of either 25% or 0%, depending on whether their merchandise exports to the United States are compliant with the United States Mexico Canada trade agreement (USMCA). On average, around one-half of their imports into the United States are thought to be USMCA-compliant at present, with compliance depending on the extent of local content and the filing of relevant rules-of-origin documentation. 2 Heightened uncertainty will also reduce trade through a variety of channels, including through the effect on investment and raising the costs of inventories (Novy and Taylor, 2020; Limao and Maggi, 2015). 16  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 • The high proportion of cars and parts in total exports to the United States raises the effective rates faced by Mexico, as well as a number of Asian and European countries, including Japan, Korea, Germany and the Slovak Republic. For Canada, the impact of the higher effective rate on cars and car parts is offset by the 10% tariff applied on its energy exports to the United States. • In contrast, some products currently remain exempt from tariffs, including pharmaceuticals, semi-conductors and other zero-rated items such as copper. This helps to lower considerably the effective US tariff on imports from countries such as Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The United States is an important export market for a number of countries, accounting for around 75% of goods exports for Mexico and Canada, 19% for Japan, 13% for China and 10% for Germany in 2023 (Figure 1.3). The importance of exports for overall activity also varies greatly by country. Exports to the United States are equivalent to over 20% of GDP in its North American trading partners, over 5% of GDP for many smaller open Asian economies and Korea, and between 3 and 4% of GDP for many European countries, including Germany and many of its key European supply chain partners. Exports from emerging\u0002market economies such as China, India, South Africa and Türkiye represent a smaller share of their domestic output. In value-added terms, the extent of direct exposure to the United States via exports is often smaller because of offsetting effects from intermediate inputs used in production for final exports. However, indirect exposures can also be significant due to integrated cross-border supply chains in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Data on the extent of such exposures is less timely, but highlight the comparatively high exposures of Mexico, Canada, Ireland, Korea and some other Latin American economies, such as Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica (Figure 1.4). Imports into the United States also include around 0.5% of US value-added that was previously exported from the United States. Combined sector exposures are likely to be largest for the wholesale and retail sector, as well as cars and other manufacturing industries such as ICT, machinery and electrical equipment. In addition to weaker trade volumes, domestic price increases are likely to follow higher tariffs, although the exact magnitude is subject to some uncertainty. Around 10% of the consumer basket in the United States is imported, directly and indirectly, before taking into account food and energy (Barbiero and Stein, 2025). It is likely that most of the impact of tariff increases will be borne by consumers and businesses, as occurred in the United States in 2018/19 when US tariffs on Chinese imports rose (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal, 2022; Amiti et al., 2020 and Cavallo et al., 2021). The extent of price increases faced by consumers will depend on whether retailers just raise prices to cover the higher dollar cost or whether they maintain their current price-cost margin. For example, if retailers just passed-through the additional costs of a 60% tariff increase on China and a 10% tariff rise on the rest of the world, consumer prices could be expected to rise by 1.4 percentage points. By contrast, if retailers maintained a constant margin of selling prices over purchasing costs, consumer prices could rise 2.2 percentage points (Barbiero and Stein, 2025). The eventual cost increases to consumers might further be mitigated by dollar appreciation, or if exporters or domestic producers lower their margins. However, experience from the 2018-2019 tariffs showed that even local producers who are not affected by imports may raise prices when most major competitors are being forced to raise costs, without fear of losing market share (Flaaen et al, 2020). There is also evidence that price increases tended to be rapid, often occurring within two to three months (Minton and Somale, 2025). There are signs that a similar pattern may emerge this year. Minton and Somale (2025) estimate that US consumers already faced a 0.3 percentage point rise in core goods prices in March stemming from tariff increases on Chinese goods in February and March. Carvallo et al (2025) also find marked increases in US retailers’ prices of goods imported from China. Survey evidence suggests that US firms which rely on  17 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 imported inputs tend to have markedly higher inflation expectations for 2025 than firms with low or no imported inputs (Edwards et al, 2025) and most importers expect to pass on cost increases over the next two years, in response to a range of tariff scenarios (Andrade et al., 2025). In other countries, weaker economic activity in the United States may exert downward pressure on commodity prices and selling prices as exporters seek to aggressively expand into new markets. On the other hand, currency depreciation due to lower risk appetite and fears of further tariff action to protect industries may limit the extent of price discounting. Figure 1.2. Recent trade policy announcements imply substantial change in effective tariffs Note: Estimates based on trade policy announcements as of 14 May 2025. Panel A based on the USD value of affected imported US goods at the HS8 digit level, scaled by the share of nominal US goods imports as a share of nominal world GDP. Retaliation includes announced measures by Canada (USD 65bn) and China (all US exports), scaled by the share of nominal US goods imports as a share of nominal world GDP. Panel B based on the US International Trade Commission (USITC) estimate of the average effective tariffs until 2024. For 2025, the average tariff rate is calculated based on HS classifications of tariff-affected items matched to US Census Bureau data for 2024 import weights of product categories. Panel C excludes any estimate of the impact of the de minimis trade policy changes. The net sector-specific adjustment change includes a 25% tariff for listed cars and parts except for US-related content, provided that meets a minimum 20% (Canadian cars are assumed to have 25% US content, Mexico 20% and rest of world 0%, rounding results from the 2020 TiVA tables); a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium products; 0% tariff increases on any items listed in the official exclusions to the tariffs for all countries other than Canada and Mexico; and a 10% increase in tariff rates on all other goods for all countries, with the exception of Canada, Mexico and China. Mexico and Canada face a 25% tariff, except for energy and potash products from Canada which face a 10% tariff, and USMCA compliant goods which face a 0% tariff. Assuming 50% compliance, this equates to an effective tariff rate of 12.5% for all non-car goods. The United Kingdom is assumed to have a 10% tariff on cars based on the quota specified in the announced US-UK trade agreement, which accounted for 80% of the cars and parts exports, and 0% tariff on steel and aluminium. Data classifications are based on HS8 lists as published by the US administration. Weights are calculated based on 2024 US Census Bureau product level data for US imports, by country.

Consumer confidence was already below long-run average levels in most economies but has shown further notable declines in Sweden, the United States, Lithuania and South Africa in the early months of 2025 (Figure 1.5, Panel A). In contrast, confidence has recently picked up in Türkiye, Poland and Chile. Empirical estimates suggest that the sharp fall in consumer confidence in the United States is mostly attributable to the increase in policy uncertainty since December 2024 (Figure 1.5, Panel B). The pace of retail sales has eased since last year in the United States and the euro area but has displayed greater resilience in China (Figure 1.5, Panel C). Business surveys suggest a slowdown in Canada, Mexico, Spain and the United States since the start of 2025 (Figure 1.5, Panel D), with available measures suggesting wide dispersion in firms’ expectations regarding the duration of tariffs. However, new orders for manufacturing goods remained strong in some euro area economies, including Germany and France, sustaining the pick-up seen since the start of the year. Some of the ongoing strength in manufacturing activity in these economies likely reflects a temporary surge in demand for tradeable goods given the perceived risk of higher tariff rates from July 2025. Figure 1.5. Recent economic indicators have weakened in several large economies Note: In Panel A, the most recent data are for April 2025, except for Chile, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa (March 2025), and Switzerland (February 2025). The latest information for Canada refers to the first quarter of 2025, and relates to 'Perceiving their financial situation is currently deteriorating'. The scenario in Panel B is based on the results from a cross-country model that regresses consumer confidence on developments in core, food and energy inflation, the unemployment rate, the share market index, house prices and the economic policy uncertainty index. The scenario assumes all else constant apart from economic policy uncertainty which remains at the level observed in December 2024. Panel D shows PMI manufacturing output for Mexico.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/yqop58 20  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Merchandise trade volumes rose strongly in late 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, helped by front-loading, with some exporters bringing forward planned shipments to the United States ahead of expected tariff increases (Figure 1.6, Panel A). The surge in US imports has been most apparent in industrial supplies, including steel and aluminium, in late 2024, and pharmaceutical goods in the first quarter of 2025, and has been accompanied by rising inventory growth for manufacturers and many retailers. International air freight traffic also rose in March and April, likely due to front-loading. More broadly, global container traffic continued to expand in the first quarter of 2025 and survey measures of manufacturing export orders have improved steadily in the advanced economies, with a normalisation in Germany (Figure 1.6, Panel B). Nonetheless, some signs are emerging that weaker performance is expected. Global container prices in April were 40% lower than at the start of the year. Routes between Shanghai and the United States have been heavily affected, both by the introduction of tariffs, which precipitated sharp declines, and the recent reduction in US-China tariff rates, which resulted in a 30% rebound in container shipping rates since the announcement – although rates remain 30% lower than at the end of 2024.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/j3mb1t Financial market volatility has subsided but higher risk aversion persists After pronounced turbulence in April, financial markets have normalised, with a strong rebound in global equity prices, declining equity and bond market volatility and a broad stabilisation of sovereign bond yields. Nonetheless, financial market conditions remain tighter than in late 2024 (Figure 1.7), as market volatility remains elevated and signs of risk aversion persist in some market segments, including for lower-rated corporate bonds and global companies exposed to the US market. In contrast to typical episodes of risk repricing, the US dollar has depreciated since the start of April, with investors significantly reducing their exposure to US financial assets.  21 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.7.

Equity markets recovered in May, after experiencing a sharp decline across several advanced and emerging-market economies following the US announcement of larger-than-expected tariffs on all trading partners in early April. Equity market performance in 2025 has been strongest in Europe and in selected emerging-market economies, particularly Brazil and Mexico. In Japan and the United States, equity valuations have essentially caught up to their levels at end-December 2024. Equity risk premia have recently declined after moderate increases in the United States, the United Kingdom and in Europe, while asset valuations continue to remain stretched. There are persisting signs of some differences across companies according to their potential exposure to tariff barriers. Since mid-February, the equity prices of companies more highly exposed to the US market have underperformed others (Figure 1.8, Panel A). The magnitude of the decline has varied across regions, with the largest impact in China and Asia-Pacific economies. European companies have been affected to a lesser extent. As the announced tariffs have been relatively broad, the negative effects have weighed on equity prices in most sectors. The equity prices of US companies with significant international exposure also initially underperformed their more domestically focused counterparts in March and April, particularly in consumer goods and industrial sectors (Figure 1.8, Panel B), although this has subsequently moderated as the perceived risk of widespread retaliatory trade policy measures by other countries on imports from the United States has eased. 22  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.8.

Despite several episodes of volatility, long-term sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies currently stand at levels broadly similar to those recorded at the end of December 2024. After considerable fluctuations in April, yields have however increased in some advanced economies in recent weeks, notably in the United States where yields have been pushed up by a rising term premium amid concerns about policy uncertainty and public debt sustainability. In contrast, after a significant rise in March following the announcement of substantial additional expenditures on defence and infrastructure in Germany in the wake of the debt brake reform, long-term sovereign bond yields in the euro area have since declined, as investors have been seeking safe-haven assets. At the same time, policy rate cuts have continued in most advanced economies and some emerging-market economies, and markets continue to price in further rate reductions in most advanced economies. Amid higher volatility in equity and currency markets, changes in sovereign bond yields in emerging-market economies have been relatively muted. Spreads on USD-denominated sovereign bonds have mostly reversed their increases in early April and are generally around their 2019 levels in major emerging-market economies. In Mexico, long-term yields have steadily declined over the year, reflecting the weaker economic outlook. In Brazil, long-term yields have also recently declined, partly due to expectations of easing inflationary pressures, but are still around end-2024 levels and relatively high. In Colombia as well as South Africa and Türkiye, bond yields have risen in 2025 and are, on average, now higher than in the 2010s. In contrast, bond yields in many Asian emerging-market economies are around or below the average levels observed during the previous decade. Chinese long-term bond yields have weakened in April, with the expansion of fiscal support offset by the higher trade tensions and monetary policy easing, and are close to record lows. Long-term bond yields in India and smaller open economies such as Malaysia and Thailand have fallen since early 2025.  23 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Corporate credit spreads over risk-free rates have narrowed from their peak levels in 2025, but remain elevated, particularly for lower-rated corporate bonds (Figure 1.9, Panel B). This signals growing market concerns over riskier assets, especially in the United States. Spreads on corporate bonds and leveraged loans had previously been at low levels, encouraging strong issuance but also raising risks of a sharp repricing if downside risks materialised. Leveraged loan issuance in the first quarter of 2025 was 40% higher than a year earlier. However, issuance of high-yield corporate bonds of the lowest ratings has been muted in the United States since early April. This freeze poses risks for private equity firms that often depend on the junk bond market for funding acquisitions, as well as for banks providing short-term loans for such transactions before firms secure longer-term financing. Bank lending and deposit rates have declined broadly in line with policy rate reductions, with signs of improvement in credit demand. However, credit standards for loans to firms tightened slightly in the euro area in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a rise in perceived risks about the economic outlook. Figure 1.9. Volatility has eased, but lower-rated corporate bond spreads remain elevated Note: Based on data up to 27 May 2025. In Panel A, the implied volatility as measured by the VIX index can be interpreted as the market expectation of risk (future volatility). The MOVE index is a yield curve weighted index of the normalised implied volatility on 1-month Treasury options which are weighted on the 2-, 5-, 10- and 30-year contracts. Panel B shows option-adjusted spreads (OAS), which measure the difference in yield between a high-yield rated bond with an embedded option (such as a callable bond) and a sovereign bond. The difference between OAS of CCC and BB to B rated US corporate bonds is shown. It indicates the risk premium for investors in high-risk versus lower-risk high-yield corporate bonds.

Labour markets were easing but remained tight before new tariff measures Employment conditions were already easing in many economies before the announcement of new trade policy measures, but labour markets generally remained in solid health. Median annualised employment growth in the final quarter of 2024 was 0.3% in the OECD, down from 0.8% in the first half of the year. Employment growth had also started to slow in some large non-OECD economies, including Brazil. Nonetheless, employment as a share of the working-age population was generally high compared with the pre-pandemic period, reflecting both relatively low unemployment and increased participation rates (Figure 1.10, Panel A). This was often enabled by older workers significantly increasing participation, such as in Czechia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain (Figure 1.10, Panel B). While the employment effects of the new tariffs and heightened policy uncertainty remain unclear, employment has fallen in recent months in some economies, including Canada and Japan. Employment conditions from business surveys have also eased notably, including in the United States, China, Canada, Mexico and India. 24  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.10.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/zjyf1c Nominal wage growth was moderating at the start of the year, but remained high in many regions compared to the pre-pandemic period. In most advanced economies, strong wage growth accompanied by limited productivity gains had kept unit labour cost growth above levels consistent with central bank inflation targets. Strong minimum wage increases were supporting ongoing wage momentum in some European economies, and robust base pay growth in Japan was accompanied by high winter bonus payments and a strong outcome in the annual wage negotiations for the 2025 financial year. Real wages were growing robustly at the end of 2024 and had returned to or surpassed pre-pandemic levels in most OECD countries following gradual disinflation. The imposition of new tariffs may result in stronger nominal wage demands as households respond to higher final goods prices. For example, around three quarters of respondents to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations, undertaken in January and February 2025, expected their cost of living to increase because of the trade conflict. Inflationary pressures have resurfaced in some economies Inflationary pressures were still lingering in many economies early in 2025, with inflation often above target levels (Figure 1.11, Panel A). In the OECD, services price inflation remained elevated, largely due to stickiness in housing cost growth. At the same time, goods inflation had begun to rise, albeit from very low levels, primarily owing to stronger food price inflation (Figure 1.11, Panel B). The recent strengthening of food prices was most evident in Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in some emerging-market economies like Costa Rica and Colombia. Overall, inflation developments in emerging\u0002market economies have been more disparate. Despite having eased, annual headline inflation in Argentina and Türkiye was still tracking at double-digit rates, respectively, in early 2025. In contrast, inflation in China remained close to zero as of April.  25 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Business surveys suggest manufacturing input and output prices have moved higher in advanced economies this year, particularly in Canada and the United States (Figure 1.11, Panels C and D). However, such measures do not suggest upward momentum in final services prices so far. Increased import tariffs are expected to induce an upward adjustment to price levels in the levying country. The persistence of the inflationary impact will depend on whether this is accompanied by higher nominal wage demands and increases in firm mark-ups. The magnitude of such second-round effects is likely to be more modest in economies with well-anchored inflation expectations. Figure 1.11. Inflation remains high with goods inflation having recently picked up Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; OECD Consumer Prices database; S&P Global; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/nelod7 Aggregate inflation expectations have moved higher in some economies. Financial market measures of 10-year breakeven inflation in major economies have not moved greatly, including in the United States (Figure 1.12, Panel A). However, short-run household inflation expectations have spiked in a few economies in recent months, most notably in the United States, but also in Canada and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.12, Panel B). This may partly reflect the recent inflation increase in items salient to household budgets, such as food, as well as the anticipated impact of higher tariffs on inflation. More granular data of both one-year-ahead and three-year-ahead inflation expectations highlight that the aggregate movements have reflected an increasing proportion of households expecting inflation to exceed 4% (see Box 1.2 below). Corporate inflation expectations have also increased in several advanced economies, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan (Figure 1.12, Panels C and D). 26  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.12.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/lxz1mo Projections Global GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.3% in 2024, to 2.9% in 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.13, Panel A; Table 1.1), with weakening economic prospects particularly evident in North America and some Asian economies, especially China (Figure 1.13, Panel B). On a Q4/Q4 basis, global growth is expected to slip to just 2.6% by the fourth quarter of 2025, from 3.4% in 2024, before recovering to 3% through 2026. These projections are based on a technical assumption that the bilateral tariff rates prevailing in mid-May persist through the rest of 2025 and 2026, despite ongoing legal challenges. Higher bilateral tariff rates and elevated policy uncertainty are expected to weigh on growth in business investment and trade. At the same time, consumer spending is also projected to soften in most economies as fragile sentiment and lingering cost of living pressures are compounded by the impact of higher trade costs on final goods prices and, in some countries, weaker labour market developments. The revised global growth projections are weaker than in the December 2024 OECD Economic Outlook and also the version of the March 2025 OECD Interim Economic Outlook projections that adopted the most comparable technical assumptions related to trade barriers (the “light tariff scenario”; Figure 1.13, Panel C). Inflation in G20 countries is expected to moderate gradually through 2026, with the inflationary impact from higher trade barriers offset by lower oil prices over 2025-26 and softer growth (Figure 1.13, Panel D; Annex 1.A). The United States is a key exception, with annual headline and core inflation now projected to peak at around 3.9% and 4.0% respectively in the fourth quarter of 2025 and remain above target in 2026.  27 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.13.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4w3gms Central banks in many OECD economies are assumed to further lower monetary policy rates to mitigate the severity of the slowdown in economic growth and employment conditions. However, policy rates are expected to remain unchanged in 2025 in the United States given the upside risks to inflation. Another exception is Japan, where persisting inflation is anticipated to warrant continued gradual policy interest rate increases. Fiscal policy is assumed to tighten modestly in most of the large OECD economies over 2025-26, with the sustainability of public debt a common concern, but less so in many of the smaller economies. However, Germany’s reform of its fiscal rules and planned increase in defence and infrastructure spending are assumed to result in a sizeable stimulus in 2026, and much stronger public investment. In the United States, the assumed enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is also expected to result in some additional fiscal support in 2026. Most emerging-market economies are assumed to have a broadly neutral fiscal policy stance with some further monetary policy easing. China is an exception, with significant further fiscal expansion expected in 2025, with policy rates expected to be kept around currently low levels. The prospects for individual major economies and regions are as follows: • In the United States, output growth is expected to slow significantly due to the substantially higher effective tariff rate on imports, combined with retaliatory measures from some trading partners, elevated policy uncertainty and softer real income growth. In addition, a further slowdown in net 28  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 immigration and reduction in the federal workforce are anticipated to moderate growth. On an annual basis, GDP growth is projected to weaken from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, with growth in the year to the fourth quarter of 2025 declining to just 1.1%. Similarly, new trade restrictions are anticipated to weigh on activity in Canada, with monetary policy assumed to provide only modest further support amid lingering inflation concerns. Canadian GDP growth is projected to fall from 1.5% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. In both economies, a sizeable price level change is projected, with inflation anticipated to spike in mid-2025 before moderating towards target over time. • The Japanese economy is expected to expand at a moderate pace, with private consumption growth supported by strong wage gains and business investment growth underpinned by healthy profits and government subsidies. Offsetting forces will be subdued external demand amid new trade restrictions and elevated trade policy uncertainty, with GDP growth projected to moderate from 0.7% in 2025 to 0.4% in 2026. In Korea, growth is projected to recover, with stronger real incomes and improving labour market conditions supporting household spending. After dipping from 2.1% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025, GDP growth is projected to be 2.2% in 2026. • Growth in the euro area is projected to remain modest at 1.0% in 2025, after 0.8% in 2024, before picking up to 1.2% in 2026, with increased trade frictions being offset by ongoing capital spending from NextGenerationEU funds, resilient labour markets and a recent easing of credit conditions. Additional cuts to monetary policy rates and the projected fiscal expansion in Germany are also expected to support growth, particularly next year. Modest increases in unemployment rates are expected to be accompanied by further moderation in wage growth. Price pressures are expected to abate further, with headline inflation in the euro area projected to be back around target in 2026. In the United Kingdom, growth is projected to be around estimated potential, at 1.3% in 2025 and 1.0% in 2026, as trade tensions and elevated uncertainty offset the positive impact from last autumn’s budgetary measures on government consumption and investment. • In China, after robust growth at the start of 2025, the tightening of bilateral tariff rates and the planned elimination of the de minimis exemption on imports to the United States, combined with retaliatory trade measures, will weaken output growth. However, this is expected to be partly offset by domestic fiscal stimulus focused on government subsidies for consumer goods and social transfers. Real GDP growth is projected to ease from 5.0% in 2024 to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, with increased trade costs and recent increases in global food prices pushing inflation up from its currently low levels. • India and Indonesia are projected to continue to experience strong and broadly stable economic growth. While easing monetary policy will aid ongoing expansions in both economies, higher tariffs in the United States, global trade policy uncertainty, and domestic fiscal policy uncertainty in Indonesia, will have an offsetting effect. In India, economic growth is projected to be 6.3% in FY2025-26 and 6.4% in FY2026-27, while the Indonesian economy is expected to grow by 4.7% in 2025 and 4.8% in 2026. Inflation in both economies is projected to remain largely benign, although past currency depreciation in Indonesia will feed through into higher domestic prices and push up inflation this year. • Growth in Mexico is projected to slow further in 2025 as higher trade barriers are combined with subdued increases in public spending. However, monetary policy easing will be a supportive factor, with output growth projected to be 0.4% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. In Brazil, growth is also expected to slow from 3.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, as restrictive monetary policy and new trade barriers are only partially offset by the positive impact of expansionary fiscal policy. Inflation is projected to remain high but to fall back into the central bank target range in the second half of 2026.  29 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 The substantial changes to trade policies up to mid-May, with a technical assumption that they persist through the remainder of 2025 and 2026 are a significant drag to world trade in goods and services. Global trade is now projected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026, 0.8 and 1.3 percentage points lower respectively than the projections in the December 2024 OECD Economic Outlook. Much of the decline reflects lower trade in the United States, China, and regional partners who are heavily integrated into their global supply chains (Figure 1.14, Panel A). In 2025, the introduction of US import tariffs and greater trade policy uncertainty will also weigh on Europe, but a pick-up in domestic growth in Germany in 2026 should fuel a recovery in intra-EU trade. The front-loading of exports to the United States in late 2024 and early 2025, together with a continued expansion of services trade, limit the overall decline in annual trade volume growth in 2025. Nonetheless, quarterly trade growth is expected to remain weak for some time and global trade volumes in the fourth quarter of 2026 are 2.1% lower than previously projected (Figure 1.14, Panel B). Many emerging-market economies, particularly commodity exporters, are expected to have much softer export growth as demand from both China and the United States is lower. However, some countries such as Argentina and Chile are relatively insulated, with half of their exports to the United States tariff exempt. Figure 1.14. The regional drivers of trade growth are changing Note: ‘Europe’ refers to OECD Europe. The Dynamic Asian economies are Hong Kong (China), Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and Viet Nam. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/9we63h Despite the sizeable shifts in world trade volumes, changes in national current account balances are expected to be relatively limited (Figure 1.15, Panel A). Some key surplus countries such as China see a sharp slowdown in imports alongside exports, whilst in the United States weaker export growth limits the improvement in the overall current account that would have been generated by weaker import growth. One exception is Germany, where fiscal policy changes are expected to boost domestic demand and raise import growth even as export growth weakens due to trade policy changes; this results in a lower current account surplus. Overall, most countries’ current account balances are a smaller share of world GDP than prior to the global financial crisis, and remain largely unchanged over 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.15, Panel B). 30  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.15.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/eron8u Employment growth in the OECD is expected to weaken, with the annual pace of employment gains in the median OECD country projected to be 0.7% over 2025-26, down from 1% in 2024 (Figure 1.16, Panel A). Employment growth is projected to be more resilient in some non-OECD emerging economies, such as India and South Africa, but to continue to slow in China as the ageing population further reduces labour supply. Labour force growth is also generally projected to ease from its recent fast pace, with migration inflows moderating in some economies. Consequently, the median unemployment rate across OECD economies is projected to remain broadly stable over the projection horizon. However, higher unemployment is projected in the United States as growth slows, with the unemployment rate rising towards 4½ per cent in the first half of 2026 before starting to moderate. With demand and supply in labour markets in better balance, nominal wage growth is projected to continue to ease in most economies (Figure 1.16, Panel B). This will combine with a projected improvement in labour productivity growth to facilitate further easing in unit labour cost growth and, in turn, reduce inflationary pressures. Further declines in headline inflation are projected in most advanced and emerging-market economies where inflation is currently exceeding the central bank target (Figure 1.17). In addition to the United States, exceptions include South Africa, where inflation will be pushed up by an increase in value added tax and the narrowing output gap, and Brazil, where a recent upturn in services inflation will keep annual inflation high despite a projected fall in quarterly inflation throughout 2026. In the euro area, inflation will remain relatively elevated in a number of economies with tight labour markets, including Latvia, Lithuania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.  31 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.16.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0x94gc 32  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Risks Growth could be hit by more restrictive trade policies, prolonged uncertainty and tighter financial conditions A key risk is that bilateral tariff rates are raised further on merchandise imports into the United States, potentially prompting retaliatory measures by trade partners. Such developments would be likely to intensify risk repricing in financial markets and prolong policy uncertainty. This would also sap confidence, add to the downward pressures on corporate and household spending around the world, and weaken global demand for many key commodities. A set of illustrative simulations using the NiGEM global macroeconomic model in forward-looking mode highlights the different near-term effects that some of these developments might have (Figure 1.18): • A scenario in which US bilateral tariff rates are raised further by an additional 10 percentage points on all countries could lower global output by just under 0.3% by the second year, with a larger fall of 0.6% in the United States. Inflation would also be higher, rising by an average 0.8 percentage points per annum in the United States in the first two years and by close to 0.5 percentage points per annum in the world. While the strongest effects are felt in the United States, weaker US import demand reduces export growth in all trading partners, and an appreciation in the dollar effective exchange rate of close to 4% mitigates the inflationary impact in the United States but raises import prices elsewhere. • The initial shock to growth would be amplified if accompanied by a further deterioration in global equity markets and heightened risk premia due to greater uncertainty, and greater precautionary saving by consumers. In the illustrative scenario, equity prices are assumed to fall by 10%, investment risk premia increase by 50 basis points and household saving rates to rise by 1 percentage point, with these shocks lasting for two years. Collectively, the combined shocks could push global output down by around 1.2% by the second year, with larger declines in many advanced economies. The additional demand shocks are deflationary, reducing both consumer spending and investment, and so the impact of higher trade costs on inflation would be reduced, with the increase in global inflation slowing to an average 0.2 percentage points per annum over the first two years. • Commodity prices are likely to be an additional shock absorber, with weaker global demand likely to push down prices, at least in the near term. This would help to support real incomes in commodity-importing economies and lower headline consumer price inflation. An illustrative decline of 10% in global oil and gas prices could reduce global inflation by an average 0.3 percentage points per annum in the first two years, with the largest declines in more energy\u0002intensive non-OECD economies, and raise global output by around 0.1%. Combined with the other illustrative shocks, global inflation would be little changed overall, with global output falling by 1.1% by the second year of the shock. • The balance of these different shocks if they were to occur would have implications for macroeconomic policies. In the illustrative initial trade policy shock, policy interest rates are raised in the United States to help mitigate potential second-round effects on inflation, with rates rising relative to baseline by around ¾ percentage points on average in the first two years. The appreciation of the dollar exchange rate helps to raise import prices in other countries, with policy interest rates rising modestly in most in response. In the full combined shock, policy interest rates decline in all economies, reflecting the overall deflationary nature of these shocks. Fiscal pressures would increase as a result of the combined shocks, with weaker activity initially reducing tax revenue and higher unemployment adding to spending costs. After two years, government debt-to GDP ratios are raised by around 2 percentage points in the typical advanced economy.  33 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 The impact of additional policy uncertainty could be even higher than shown in the illustrative scenario. Empirical estimates suggest that a one standard deviation shock to the economic policy uncertainty index is associated with a 1% cumulative decline in investment (see further discussion in Chapter 2). To put this in context, the economic policy uncertainty index for Canada rose by over 9 standard deviations between October 2024 and March 2025. Figure 1.18. Further trade cost increases and heightened uncertainty would harm growth Note: Simulated impact of an unanticipated increase of 10 percentage points in US tariffs on all non-commodity imports, a decline of 10% in equity prices in all countries, a rise of 50 basis points in global investment risk premia, a rise of 1 percentage point in household saving rates in all countries and a 10% decline in oil and natural gas prices. The tariff increases persist but the other shocks are assumed to fade gradually after two years. Source: OECD calculations using the NiGEM macroeconomic model. StatLink 2https://stat.link/y7updh Inflation could be more persistent An additional downside risk is that inflation remains stickier than otherwise anticipated. This could prompt more restrictive monetary policy, weakening growth prospects. Inflation remains above central bank targets in most OECD economies. In addition, the higher tariff rates imposed by the United States and China may result in higher-than-expected upward price adjustments for final goods in these economies, and higher costs that feed through to export prices. Any future effective exchange rate depreciation in other countries would also further raise import prices in these jurisdictions. As discussed above, another key risk is that tariff-induced price increases are accompanied by significant second round effects that cause further inflation persistence. Workers’ responding to lower purchasing power by pushing for higher nominal wages could raise costs for firms that may be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices. Attempts by companies to maintain their existing price-cost margins would also amplify the impact of the initial rise in import costs. Tight labour markets in many economies, combined with signs of rising consumer (Box 1.2) and corporate inflation expectations in some economies (Figure 1.12, Panel C), are factors that may elevate the probability of this risk occurring. Labour-intensive services sectors could experience particularly high inflation under such a scenario. 34  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Box 1.2. The distribution of household inflation expectations The distribution of inflation expectations provides information about the degree to which expectations are anchored to central bank inflation targets and how risks to inflation expectations are evolving through time. Recent moves upward in one-year ahead aggregate inflation expectations in the United States and Canada have been accompanied by a material increase in the proportion of respondents expecting inflation to exceed 4% in these economies. Around 48% of respondents in the United States in April 2025 expected inflation to be above that level, up from 35% in November 2024 (Figure 1.19, Panel A). In Canada, the proportion of respondents expecting inflation above 4% one-year ahead rose to 57% in the first quarter of 2025 from 44% in the fourth quarter of 2024 (Figure 1.19, Panel C). While there has also been an upward shift in the distribution of inflation expectations in some European economies, including Spain and the United Kingdom, this has not been the case in others, such as France, Italy, Germany and Belgium (Figure 1.19, Panel E and F). Figure 1.19. An increasing share of households in the United States and Canada are now expecting high inflation Note: In Panels E and F, “Latest” is March 2025 for all countries other than the United Kingdom (February 2025).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/e3hkrc  35 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 In comparison to the period immediately prior to the pandemic, the proportion of respondents in the United States and Canada expecting inflation to be at the inflation target has declined. This is also apparent when assessing the shifts in the distribution of expectations for inflation in the medium term (three-years ahead for the United States and two-years ahead for Canada; Figure 1.19, Panel B and D). There has also been a slight decline between late 2024 and early 2025 in the share of respondents expecting inflation to be at target. Corporate financial strains may prompt further risk repricing and spillovers across financial institutions Risk repricing in financial markets could be even more extensive in the event of downside surprises to economic growth or a resurgence of inflation. This would heighten market volatility and increase risks to financial stability. Despite recent moderation, asset valuations remain elevated in the United States and a few other markets (Figure 1.20, Panel A), and equity benchmarks remain highly concentrated (Figure 1.20, Panel B). Across both advanced and emerging economies, earnings expectations have continued to grow (Figure 1.21, Panel A), although some signs have begun to appear recently that suggest expected earnings may have plateaued in the United States. Potential risks to corporate earnings include a greater-than-expected impact of higher trade costs on profitability, as well as a more extensive economic slowdown than projected (Figure 1.21, Panel B). If there is a downward adjustment to earnings expectations, there could be sizeable further equity market corrections. Figure 1.20. Equity prices remain richly valued and many financial markets are increasingly concentrated Note: Panel A shows price-to-earnings ratios in selected G20 economies. Based on data up to 27 May 2025.

The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) is calculated using 10-year average “cyclically-adjusted” earnings, expressed in April 2025 prices. A higher CAPE ratio compared to the PER indicates that stocks are richly valued. The concentration of equity benchmarks in Panel B is the share of the top 20 companies in the total market capitalisation of each equity benchmark for advanced and emerging-market economies.

Source: OECD calculations. Elevated levels of marketable and non-marketable corporate debt,3 with a large and growing share of non\u0002investment-grade bonds and leveraged loans,4 and high corporate refinancing needs in the near future pose risks to financial stability (OECD, 2024a; OECD, 2025a). The expected default risk premium for low\u0002rated corporates has risen markedly in North America, Europe, and Asia since mid-February, and despite recent moderation remains above levels observed prior to the announcement of higher tariffs in the United States. (Figure 1.22, Panel A). Concerns that banks could face higher non-performing loans were reflected in the decline in their price-to-book value ratios in April 2025 (Figure 1.22, Panel B) and higher expected default risk premia at large banks around the world. Weaker corporate financial conditions, combined with high uncertainty induced by additional tariffs in the world trading system, could also raise financing costs and deter fixed investment.5 3 Corporate debt (including both loans and bonds) in advanced economies declined to USD 54 trillion (94% of GDP) in 2024, down from a peak of USD 62 trillion (108% of GDP) in 2020. Corporate debt (broadly defined) in emerging economies remained elevated at USD 39 trillion (91% of GDP) in 2024, down from the record levels observed in 2020 (106% of GDP). Estimates are based on data on credit to the non-financial sector from the Bank for International Settlements. 4 The share of high-yield bond issuance in total bond issuance by non-financial corporates increased from 16% in 2009 to 22% in 2023, and the average share of leveraged loans in the total syndicated loans of non-financial corporates increased from an average 38% between 2000 and 2012 to 43% between 2013 and 2024. 5 The experience from the US-China 2018-19 trade tensions suggests that companies exposed to higher tariffs have lower investment, employment and productivity growth (Amiti et al, 2025; Chor and Li, 2021).  37 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.22. Default risk premia have risen and bank performance has weakened Note: Based on data up to 27 May 2025. Panel A presents selected corporate credit default swap (CDS) indices, which serve as indicators of default risk premia. The North American index comprises the 100 most liquid entities with high-yield credit ratings traded in the CDS market. The European and Japanese indices consist of the 125 and 40 most liquid investment-grade entities, respectively, traded in the CDS market.

Panel B shows the price-to-book (P/B) ratios of banks included in bank equity benchmarks across selected economies. The P/B ratio compares a bank’s current market capitalisation (i.e. its equity market value) to its accounting book value. A P/B ratio below 1.0 suggests that the market may be undervaluing the bank or that the bank may be slow in marking down impaired assets. Source: Bloomberg; and OECD calculations. A change in investors’ risk appetite could trigger widespread sell-offs of corporate bonds, especially by non-bank financial institutions. Given the low liquidity of high-yield corporate debt, even limited shocks can generate large price corrections, with significant risks of fire sales. Over half of investment-grade corporate bonds are just above the threshold for high-yield status.6If these bonds are downgraded, institutional investors bound by rating-based regulatory requirements will be obliged to sell them. Sales pressures during a downturn could also be exacerbated by pro-cyclical behaviour, especially given relatively high investor concentration in major corporate bond markets (Li and Yu, 2022; Boermans and Veumeulen, 2016), and by redemptions at investment funds. Real estate investment funds are particularly vulnerable to these effects, given the illiquid nature of their assets and the persistently uncertain outlook for the commercial real estate market. Real estate investment trusts experienced a marked decline in performance in April, with the industrial and retail sectors being hit hardest. The high price volatility of crypto-assets and the growing interconnectedness between non-bank financial intermediaries, banks and the crypto-asset market raise substantial risks to financial stability. The market capitalisation of crypto-assets has grown rapidly in recent years, reaching a historical peak of USD 3.7 trillion in mid-December 2024, up from USD 200 billion in January 2020. Subsequent sharp price falls until early April, partly reversed afterwards, suggest elevated valuations and a high sensitivity to repricing in other asset classes (IMF, 2025). The largest single component of the crypto-asset market is Bitcoin, which now represents over two-thirds of market capitalisation, supported by high inflows into Bitcoin exchange\u0002traded products. Crypto-assets often remain less regulated than traditional financial instruments, and data gaps hinder financial stability assessment (Aerts et al. 2025). A particular concern is that price corrections in crypto-assets and potential losses of retail and institutional investors and leveraged investment funds could spill over into other parts of the financial sector and the wider economy amidst forced deleveraging in response to market losses (OECD, 2022a). For instance, redemptions of stablecoins, often 6 At end-2023, 53% of all investment grade bond issuance by non-financial companies was rated BBB. 38  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 reserve-backed by short-term debt instruments, could under certain conditions trigger liquidity runs and pose significant disruption to short-term debt markets (OECD, 2022b). Market concentration and leverage may amplify shocks Higher volatility in equity prices amid concentrated markets remains a concern as there is a greater risk of idiosyncratic shocks spilling over and becoming systemic. The market value of equity and bond markets is often concentrated in a handful of individual stocks or bond issuers, raising the risk of large idiosyncratic sectoral or firm shocks spilling over and becoming systemic.7 A sudden price decline or rise in bond yields could also be amplified by forced asset sales by leveraged and illiquid investment funds, particularly since a small number of funds account for a large share of total corporate bond investment fund assets (OECD, 2025a).8 The growth of passive investment funds (which track the returns of established market benchmarks) may contribute to increased market concentration and stronger co-movements in stock prices, potentially amplifying the impact of negative shocks. Continued inflows into passive funds often disproportionately increase the market capitalisation of the largest companies in equity benchmarks, further concentrating equity markets and heightening their vulnerability to idiosyncratic risks (ECB, 2024). Passive investment funds managed about USD 15 trillion (51.6% of total fund assets) in 2024, up from USD 2 trillion (19.7%) in 2012 (Figure 1.23, Panel A).9 The rise in passive investing has also made the demand for individual stocks more inelastic, potentially leading to higher price volatility and lower liquidity (Haddad et al., 2021). As passive asset managers buy (sell) the whole basket of index constituents in response to fund inflows (outflows) and only adjust their portfolios in line with changes to the index composition, trading commonalities may increase among stocks, with stronger price co-movement. Greater price co-movement amid concentrated markets could threaten systemic stability by increasing the likelihood that many investors face losses simultaneously following firm or sector-specific shocks, triggering waves of redemptions from investment funds and synchronised sell\u0002offs (ESRB, 2019; Chinco and Sammon, 2024; ECB, 2024; OECD, 2025a). 7 Both current levels of concentration and developments over time in equity and corporate bond markets differ substantially across countries. 8 The world’s 100 largest corporate bond funds represent well over a third of global corporate bond assets. 9 Based on aggregate investment fund assets data from Bloomberg. In 2024, the passive share is 59% for equity funds and 38% for fixed income funds.  39 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.23. Global passive investing and use of derivatives by non-bank financial intermediaries have risen Note: Panel A displays total assets under management of investment funds (i.e. mutual and exchange traded funds) globally according to their active or passive investment strategies. Passive portfolio management is a strategy that tracks the returns of a market benchmark.

Source: Bloomberg; Bank for International Settlements; Financial Stability Board; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/yugqzi The leveraged investment strategies and use of derivatives by some non-bank financial intermediaries could also amplify volatility (Figure 1.23, Panel B). The use of derivatives, particularly by speculative investment funds such as hedge funds, might enhance interconnectedness through complex intermediation chains. An unexpected rise in yields (or equity declines) can lead to rapid unwinding of leveraged trades, with forced selling in an illiquid market prompting further market weakness and margin calls (IOSCO, 2024; FSB, 2024). In early April 2025, following tariff announcements, hedge funds recorded the steepest margin calls since the onset of the pandemic.10 Interconnections between banks and non\u0002bank financial intermediaries could also lead to spillovers to the financial institutions that provide funding to investment funds when the latter face large outflows (OECD, 2024c; BIS, 2025). Financial market volatility also raises risks in emerging-market economies The risk of disruptive capital flows has risen in emerging-market economies. Between October 2024 and January 2025, capital flowed out of emerging-market economies (Figure 1.24, Panel A), partly driven by the relative strength of the US economy. However, this reversed in February and March as fears of a slowdown in the United States rose and the spread between emerging-market and US bond yields widened (Figure 1.24, Panel B). In most emerging-market economies, bilateral US dollar exchange rates have appreciated in 2025, especially since April, with a strong rise in the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso and the Taiwanese dollar, as investors reduced their exposure to US assets. Capital flows are likely to remain volatile as risks of sharp asset repricing and high uncertainty persist. For some emerging market economies, large and sudden capital inflows can lead to strong appreciation and may prove challenging 10 Although volatility in equity and bond markets and trading volumes has been exceptionally high amid forced cash raising, market functioning has remained orderly (BoE, 2025). 40  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 to manage. However, many emerging market economies are at risk of experiencing capital outflows if relative economic prospects and global risk sentiment deteriorate, which could lead to depreciation pressures and higher financing costs. Many emerging-market economies remain vulnerable to debt distress. Sovereign debt levels and borrowing costs have risen significantly in recent years. Government debt as a share of GDP is now higher than in 2019 in almost three quarters of emerging and developing economies (World Bank, 2025). In these circumstances, borrowing is likely to become more challenging. Around 40% of total outstanding high-risk government bonds at the end of 2024 will mature in 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.25, Panel A), and approximately 20% of all bonds have been issued before 2021, when interest rates were lower (OECD, 2025a). Larger countries and those with a higher credit rating have more developed local bond markets and broader access to finance. In contrast, lower income and high-risk countries rely more on foreign currency borrowing and are susceptible to changes in exchange rates and in risk sentiment. Although low-income countries have less direct exposure to trade with the United States than middle-income countries (Figure 1.25, Panel B), half remain at high risk of distress or are in distress, as many advanced countries have recently reduced foreign aid.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/w9m1kh There are several possible sources of positive surprises There are also various upside risks to the forecasts that would push economic growth higher if they were to occur. The baseline scenario assumes that the recent increases in bilateral tariff rates remain in place throughout 2025 and 2026 in all countries. A reversal of these restrictions, or steps towards a broader agreement to lower tariff barriers from current levels, would boost growth and reduce inflation relative to the baseline (see Figure 1.36 below). Additional structural reforms that lower the economic costs of regulation could also promote stronger growth. In the United States, initiatives are underway to lighten the regulatory burden by eliminating measures that create significant costs for businesses and households without effectively addressing market failures. Agency heads are currently reviewing all regulations under their jurisdiction to identify those that should be rescinded (The White House, 2025). Faced with higher trade barriers, other countries may also be prompted to undertake growth-enhancing structural reforms that promote international competitiveness. New OECD analysis highlights that regulatory reforms in network sectors could produce significant economy-wide gains: if network sector regulations in more regulated countries converged to those in the least-regulated countries, economy-wide labour productivity could rise by 1.7% (Andrews et al., 2025). Similarly, further efforts to harmonise regulations across countries, including within the European Union, or between subnational jurisdictions, such as in Canada or Australia, could support stronger trade and productivity growth. A peaceful resolution of conflicts in Europe and the Middle East could also reduce geopolitical uncertainty and improve confidence, providing a tailwind for spending and investment. Additional public defence spending could also have positive implications for growth, though this is not necessarily the case if financed by cutting other forms of government spending. There may also be an upside risk from the prospect of further declines in oil prices. Global oil supply is expected to outpace demand in the near term, owing both to weaker global demand growth and strong anticipated increases in oil production in several non-OPEC countries including the United States and Canada (IEA, 2025). 42  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Policies Tariff increases complicate monetary policy decisions Policy interest rates have declined further in most advanced economies in recent months, with the notable exception of Japan, where policy accommodation continues to be gradually withdrawn. Central bank balance sheet reductions have also continued, though the United States has slowed down quantitative tightening and Canada has announced plans to bring it to an end. The monetary policy stance remains restrictive in most countries, with forward-looking long-term real interest rates well above pre-pandemic norms and having edged up slightly in recent months, especially in Europe (Figure 1.26, Panel B). In contrast, short-term real rates have fallen, particularly in the United States (Figure 1.26, Panel A) due to an increase in one-year ahead inflation expectations. Figure 1.26. Long-term real interest rates remain high but short-term real rates have declined Note: Based on data up to 27 May 2025. In Panel A, the real short-term interest rates are calculated using nominal one-year government bond yields and one year-ahead inflation expectations by consumers in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom, and by corporates participating in the Tankan Survey in Japan.

Faced with heightened uncertainty and the likelihood that tariff increases will raise goods price inflation, central banks will need to remain vigilant to ensure that underlying inflation pressures are durably contained. A one-off rise in the relative price of tradeable goods is likely to be accommodated. However, a sequence of such changes, or signs that inflation expectations are rising and rekindling wage pressures in still-tight labour markets, would likely require higher policy rates than would otherwise be the case. Set against this, any associated decline in output would place some general downward pressure on inflation. The balance of these pressures may differ across countries. The downside effects of higher uncertainty and weaker exports are likely to be the main factors in many countries exporting to the United States, but countries raising tariffs will face pressures from sizeable price increases as well as those from softer growth. Provided trade tensions do not intensify further and inflation expectations remain anchored, policy rate reductions can continue in economies where inflation is projected to moderate. Further moderation in nominal wage growth and continued progress in disinflation in services sectors will be critical factors that enable monetary policy easing to proceed smoothly. Under the projected outlook for inflation and GDP growth, policy rate reductions are expected to continue during 2025 and in some cases 2026 in all the major advanced economies other than Japan (Figure 1.27).  43 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 • In the United States, the federal funds rate is projected to remain unchanged through 2025, with rates then being lowered to 3¼-3½% by the end of 2026. Bond holdings are projected to decline further throughout 2025-26, albeit at a slower pace reflecting the lower monthly redemption cap for Treasury securities from April 2025. • In the euro area, policy rate reductions are projected to continue this year, bringing the deposit facility rate to 1¾% by the third quarter of 2025. The decline in Eurosystem bond holdings is expected to continue broadly at the pace observed since early 2025, with no reinvestment of redemptions under either the asset purchase programme or the pandemic emergency purchase programme. • In Japan, the policy rate is projected to increase gradually to 1¼% by the end of 2026, as core inflation stabilises around 2% and a negative output gap gradually closes. The government bond holdings of the Bank of Japan are expected to decline, as the bank’s monthly purchases are reduced by about JPY 400 billion per quarter. Bank of Japan outstanding assets under the loan support programme are also expected to decrease, as new disbursements to stimulate bank lending are scheduled to end in June 2025, and no rollover is to be made after the beginning of 2026. • Reductions in policy rates are projected to continue until the second half of 2025 in Canada and Korea, and until the first half of 2026 in Australia and the United Kingdom. Central bank bond holdings are assumed to decline further in Australia and the United Kingdom. In contrast, renewed asset purchases through term repos followed by outright purchases of treasury bills are expected in Canada, allowing the balance sheet size to eventually stabilise as a share of GDP.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/kbwrnf By the end of 2026, real policy rates are generally projected to be within estimated ranges for real neutral rates (Figure 1.28, Panel A) – the real interest rate at which the policy stance is neither accommodative nor restrictive. Inflation is generally projected to be back or close to target at that time, and growing geopolitical fragmentation increases the odds that it eventually settles at target, rather than dropping below it, as in most of the decade following the global financial crisis. This would lead to sustained higher nominal policy rates than before the pandemic, increasing the room for monetary policy manoeuvre through conventional tools in the event of future downturns. Greater room for manoeuvre could also follow if the future neutral rate was to be higher than what current estimates suggest, for instance due to reforms to 44  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 strengthen productivity and investment, or a larger supply of public debt, to which pressures on public spending (discussed below) and quantitative tightening would contribute (Schnabel, 2025). There is some tentative evidence of a mild rise in neutral rate estimates in major jurisdictions over the past few years (Figure 1.28, Panel B). Figure 1.28. Real policy rates are projected to converge towards neutral levels Note: In Panel A, the projected real policy rate in 2026Q4 is calculated using the nominal policy rate deflated by annual core inflation over the year to 2026Q4 (except for India and Indonesia, where headline inflation is used).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4ditfp Larger debt burdens will bring forward important fiscal policy choices The fiscal projections for 2025-26 are conditional on announced government measures and OECD assessments of current plans (Annex 1.A). Underlying primary balances are expected to worsen, relative to potential GDP, in several advanced OECD economies in 2025. Improvements are projected the following year, yet only a couple of countries are planning substantial fiscal consolidation in 2026. The projected median change in underlying primary balances over the next two years is approximately zero. • In the United States, the structural deficit will remain large with underlying primary spending exceeding revenues by 3.4% of GDP in 2026, and the aggregate general government budget deficit exceeding 8% of GDP. Higher tariff receipts will only partly offset revenues lost due to the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, new tax reductions and weaker economic growth. Efficiency  45 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 measures, including shrinking the federal government workforce, will help slow growth in public expenditure; however, additional spending will reduce net budget savings. • The euro area’s underlying primary deficit is estimated to shrink by 0.3% of GDP between 2024 and 2026. Modest fiscal consolidation will occur this year, associated with the phase-out of energy crisis support, with little change in the fiscal stance projected for 2026. While high-debt countries including France and Italy are planning budget repair, other economies including Germany are expected to have a fiscal expansion in 2026, with increased spending to upgrade infrastructure and military capability (Box 1.3). • Japan’s underlying primary deficit is projected to narrow by 0.9% of potential GDP in the two years to 2026. The projection assumes no supplementary budgets are passed in financial years 2025 and 2026. A corporate tax rate increase in 2026 will help finance new spending. The government is planning to increase outlays on disaster preparedness in addition to expenditure on defence and support for families with children. • Substantial fiscal policy tightening of 1% of potential GDP or more is projected over 2025-26 in Iceland, Israel, Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In contrast, fiscal expansions are projected in Denmark (2.8% of GDP), Norway (0.6% of GDP) and Sweden (0.3% of GDP) with all three Nordic countries raising defence spending. Australia’s underlying primary deficit is expected to expand in the next two years, but little change is projected in Canada. Figure 1.29.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/rxcf0i Near-term budget pressures from debt service costs and military spending will be compounded in the long run by persisting costs associated with climate mitigation and adaptation and population ageing. Sizeable primary deficits, elevated interest payments and lower growth (Figure 1.29) will keep public debt ratios high and rising in many OECD economies over 2025-26. For the group of OECD countries, the ratio of gross general government debt to GDP is projected to increase by 2.3 percentage points over the two years to the fourth quarter of 2026 (to 114% of GDP). Increases of 1.5 percentage points in the euro area and 5.9 percentage points in the United States are projected, while Japan’s gross public debt ratio is forecast to decline. Where growth is strong enough to withstand additional fiscal headwinds, consolidation efforts should intensify in high-debt countries as monetary policy becomes less restrictive. Other advanced economies have the fiscal room for manoeuvre to increase public spending for some years while running down surpluses or borrowing to finance larger deficits. Amid heightened geopolitical tensions, many countries are fast-tracking defence investments to bolster national security (Box 1.3). Such spending will 46  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 add to debt burdens in some countries in the second half of this decade. In contrast, some heavily indebted countries – including France, Italy and the United Kingdom – are pressing ahead with budget repair to avoid the risk of abrupt and painful fiscal corrections later (Figure 1.30). In the near term, governments may also face new calls for additional support in countries confronted with higher trade costs. A first line of defence is to allow automatic stabilisers to operate fully. Targeted, temporary and well-designed support measures (Hemmerlé et al., 2023) could, if necessary, help cushion the initial impact of liquidity shocks felt by companies. Protracted budgetary support to firms facing a lasting loss of external competitiveness should be avoided. Figure 1.30.

Higher defence spending: economic and public finance implications Defence spending has increased recently in many OECD countries after declining in the three decades following the end of the Cold War. This is evident in Europe, where military expenditure has outpaced growth in GDP since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and also in Israel. Relative to the size of their economies, EU countries in Central and Eastern Europe have invested particularly heavily in their armed forces (Figure 1.31). Poland and the Baltic states have set ambitious goals for future spending, pledging to lift military expenditure to 5% of GDP in years to come. High targets for defence spending, often well above recent outlays, have also been declared in Czechia and the Nordic countries as well as in France and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.32, Panel A). In Germany, where defence spending increased from relatively low levels a few years ago to reach 1.9% of GDP in 2024, constitutional hurdles to higher spending have been removed (see below). While legislated measures leave major spending challenges to future governments in some countries, ongoing defence expenditure is trending higher, in Europe and also in several Asian OECD countries, notably Japan. In contrast, the United States does not have long-term plans to raise the GDP share of its military spending, which is already higher than in most other OECD countries. Few countries have released detailed information about their medium-term defence spending plans. However, major investments in equipment and infrastructure are considered necessary in many countries to address capability gaps. For instance, European Commission estimates suggest such investments by EU member states could be worth a total of EUR 500 billion over the next decade (1.1% of 2024 GDP). 1  47 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 While defence investment has increased more rapidly than total defence spending in recent years, personnel costs – a major component of government consumption – typically still make up a larger share of OECD countries’ total defence budgets (39% on average in 2023, compared with 24% for investment).2 Higher defence spending will add to budgetary pressures in many economies. In some, consolidation of other government outlays is expected to create room for higher defence expenditure. This is reflected in budget plans in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland and the United Kingdom. Most of these countries also project budget support from higher revenues. However, few OECD countries have managed to finance large increases in defence outlays in recent years without running down fiscal surpluses or increasing budget deficits. This aligns with historical experience, as substantial additional government borrowing often accompanies the first phases of military build-ups before countries raise taxes (Marzian and Trebesch, 2025). Over the next two years, budget positions are expected to deteriorate in many countries planning higher public spending on defence. Figure 1.31.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/lk7t1x Fiscal rules are changing to accommodate higher defence spending. In Germany, constitutional reform has lifted constraints on borrowing for defence spending ahead of major investments over the coming years. Sweden has departed from a longstanding target of a budget surplus to shift to a balanced budget rule from 2027, enabling higher military expenditure. In parallel to national reforms, the European Commission has invited EU member states able to withstand additional fiscal pressure without threatening debt sustainability to make use of national escape clauses in the Stability and Growth Pact (European Commission, 2025a). Recognising Europe’s “extraordinary” security challenge, national escape clauses – once activated by the Council – would allow deviations from medium-term budget plans of up to 1.5% of GDP over the next four years, with increased spending to go only on defence.3As at the end of April, 16 member states had decided to request the activation of the national escape clause. 4 In countries with limited fiscal space, financial market pressure may curb defence-spending ambitions, even if escape clauses are activated and EU loans help fund defence investments.5 This constraint may be relevant for countries already under the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure, a group that includes France, 48  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Poland and Italy, respectively the Union’s second, third and fourth biggest defence spenders in absolute terms based on data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI, 2025). Sustaining higher military expenditure for a long period of time, or even permanently, could force higher\u0002debt countries to confront hard policy trade-offs. While increased borrowing may enable governments to finance large military investments during a transition period, countries unable to sufficiently curb growth in non-military spending may ultimately have to consider raising tax burdens further (Figure 1.32, Panel B). A challenge in monitoring the use of escape clauses will be to ensure that other types of spending, for instance non-military foreign aid, are not reclassified as defence expenditure to circumvent fiscal rules. Gains to actual or potential growth could help offset the fiscal costs of defence spending but are uncertain and will vary from country to country. In the near term, higher government final expenditure on defence will contribute to demand, employment and incomes, especially if it is financed by borrowing. Some studies suggest fiscal multipliers from military expenditure could be relatively high in advanced economies, with little or no crowding out of private demand in some circumstances (Sheremirov and Spirovska, 2022). Larger near-term output effects are more likely in low-debt countries; when monetary policy accommodates higher government spending; and in countries with established local defence industries (such as France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom). Recent analyses of the possible economic impact of higher military expenditure in Europe have produced estimates ranging from a 0.5 to 1.5% boost to Europe-wide GDP for defence spending increases of 1.5% of GDP (Ilzetzki, 2025; European Commission, 2025b), with potentially larger effects for economies in recession and if monetary policy responses are limited (Ilzetzki, 2025). In some countries, such as Germany, there are possibilities for automotive manufacturers to produce defence equipment or for defence producers to repurpose factories, buy equipment or hire workers let go by ailing car producers. However, many countries contemplating higher military spending, including some EU member states, have few or no major local producers of military equipment. In the last four years, 64% of arms imports by European NATO states came from the United States (SIPRI, 2025). The net output effects of defence spending might also differ by type of spending.6 Defence infrastructure projects (for instance, building airfields, docks or storage facilities) or spending on equipment might be associated with relatively high multipliers if, in addition to increased public sector investment, they generate domestic private sector activity and jobs, and rely mainly on locally-sourced materials. Government spending on the armed forces (for instance, additions to military personnel) also contributes to domestic output – directly through public consumption and indirectly via household consumption – and is likely to have larger net effects in economies below full employment.7 Efficient procurement will be essential to support realised improvements in military capability and may help foster innovation spillovers. In Europe, coordinated purchasing between countries should be pursued alongside steps to improve competition and reduce fragmentation in the defence market (Wolff et al., 2025). To the extent that European countries are able to source defence equipment, inputs or services from each other, and stretched availability of supplies does not raise costs, regional multipliers from defence spending could exceed those in individual European countries. Provided inflationary effects are small, positive output effects could be larger, and distributed more broadly across countries, if closely connected economies simultaneously expand their defence spending. Efficient joint procurement could also enhance long-run cross-border spillovers from investment in defence research and development.8 Historical experience suggests increased defence R&D could support higher private sector productivity (Ilzetzki, 2025), provided increased employment of skilled workers in defence does not exacerbate skills shortages in other industries. Should military spending reallocate labour and capital to less efficient uses, aggregate productivity could be lower (OECD, 2025c).  49 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.32.

Where the goal is expressed as a range (for example, 5-6% of GDP), the bottom of the range is shown. For Germany, newly passed reforms exclude military spending above 1% of GDP from the calculation of the country's debt limit.

Relatively few studies of multipliers examine the effects of different types of government spending. Findings are mixed among empirical studies comparing multipliers for government investment and consumption. For example, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) find near-term output effects of US government investment (a multiplier over 2) that are higher than those for US government consumption (roughly 0.5). Boehm (2020), in a study of OECD countries, finds the opposite holds for short-lived investment spending shocks (ones substantially dissipating within two years) - government investment multipliers are found to be near zero, reflecting lower private investment, while government consumption multipliers are higher (around 0.8). The US study of Haug and Sznajderska (2024) finds that multipliers for government consumption and investment are not statistically significantly different (and around 0.5). 7. A recent study of Central and Eastern European countries finds relatively high multipliers on military personnel expenditures (exceeding unity two years after a spending shock), which is argued to reflect private consumption by military staff (Olejnik, 2023). As in some other papers, multipliers for military expenditures are found to be higher in recessions. 8. Steinwender, Van Reenen and Moretti (2019) study spillovers from defence to private sector R&D within and across countries. 50  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 With debt burdens already high in many countries, a step-up in fiscal pressure brings forward hard policy choices. Many of the costs of maintaining larger armed forces, mitigating climate change, adapting to warmer climates, and supporting older populations will coincide and persist for some time. These pressures will exacerbate structural budget imbalances that already exist. To keep public debt sustainable, and preserve buffers to respond to future shocks, countries should pursue fiscal reforms alongside other priorities. Many advanced economies are looking to curb public expenditure, with reductions in public investment, green infrastructure financing, foreign aid, basic research or cuts to government employment often treated as potential sources of savings. While improving the budget balance in the short run, measures of this sort may erode public service capacity, withdraw support from those most in need and set back long-term objectives, including the need for strong economic growth amid a transition to net zero emissions. Systematic and regular spending reviews and the adoption of new digital technologies could help to improve public sector efficiency while preserving essential public programmes, and limit harm to potential growth by reallocating resources efficiently as priorities shift. Effective targeting of social benefits and pension systems that encourage longer working lives could also help to contain spending (OECD, 2024b; OECD, 2024c). Countries differ markedly in the resources they devote to old age and other social protection expenditure (Figure 1.33), differences that are only partly explained by relative incomes and demographics (Barnes et al., 2025). Many recently announced and ongoing tax reforms – including measures to broaden consumption tax bases by reducing distortive tax expenditures (Iceland), raise taxation of carbon emissions (Ireland, Portugal) and improve tax collection (Bulgaria, Greece) – could, if carried forward, strengthen structural budget positions while limiting costs to sustainable growth. Other current revenue raising measures, including tariff increases in the United States and direct tax measures in the United Kingdom could, however, be partially offset by adverse impacts on activity. Revenue-raising reforms should generally aim to shift tax systems over time towards less-distortive taxes with fewer exemptions, as it is difficult to alleviate debt burdens without strong economic growth (Pina et al., 2025). There is scope in several advanced economies to raise proportionally more revenue from consumption, environmental and property taxes while relying less heavily on taxing wages (OECD, 2024b; OECD, 2024c). Medium-term planning is essential to preserve or free up resources for strategically important projects, many of which will weigh on the public finances. Such plans can help avoid excessive debt accumulation and reduce uncertainty about the conduct of fiscal policy. Fiscal rules remain important for the sound management of public finances, even if subject to deviations through escape clauses or other flexibility mechanisms – for instance, to support productive investment or higher defence spending (Box 1.3). Independent fiscal institutions can also play a useful role in assessing the impact of proposed policy changes, overseeing countries’ return to quantitative budget limits, and communicating the need to keep justified departures temporary.  51 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.33.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/o0hzwi Emerging-market economies should strive to reduce inflation and fiscal deficits Policy rate reductions have continued across many emerging-market economies in recent quarters and have started in India, where inflation pressures have gradually abated, creating greater scope for supporting the economy. However, rate reductions have slowed down or been halted since early 2025 in several countries, especially in Latin America, partly due to the persistence of inflation pressures or exchange rate developments. Amid strong growth and rising inflation in Brazil, the policy rate has been raised four times since December 2024 over concerns about a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. In Türkiye, after three consecutive policy rate reductions since December 2024, the policy rate was raised again in April to lower risks of a renewed rise in inflation pressures. Given low inflation, key policy interest rates and reserve requirements have been lowered further in China. Scope still exists to lower policy rates in most emerging-market economies over the next 18 months, but policy decisions are likely to remain finely balanced. While the projected slowdown of global trade will tend to weaken economic activity, higher tariffs imposed by some countries are likely to put some upward pressure on producer costs worldwide, and higher policy uncertainty may heighten risk aversion in financial markets. Careful calibration of monetary policy will be essential to keep inflation expectations well anchored and to avoid disruptive capital outflows. If necessary, rate reductions may need to be slowed, or even reversed temporarily, to ensure price stability. The expected pace of policy rate reductions is projected to vary across countries (Figure 1.34): • China is expected to maintain an accommodative monetary stance to support activity as inflation is likely to remain low, despite some upward pressures from the additional tariffs on trade with the United States. 52  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 • In Colombia and Mexico, where policy rates remain elevated, reductions are expected to continue steadily until late 2026, with rates being lowered to 7% and 6.25%, respectively, still somewhat above or close to the upper bound of neutral level estimates. Further small rate reductions are also expected in Chile. • In India, policy rate reductions are expected to cease by end-2025, while in Indonesia modest rate reductions are projected to continue until late 2026, with inflation projected to return to target and policy rates to broadly neutral levels. The policy rate is already close to neutral level estimates in South Africa where rate reductions are expected to cease by end-2025. • In Türkiye, where inflation is projected to decline to around 15% by the end of 2026, policy rate reductions are expected to resume over 2025 and 2026. • In Brazil, given persistent inflation pressures, policy rates are projected to increase further in the coming months to 15%, before a gradual reduction starting from early 2026. Figure 1.34.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/cd4rp3 Recent fiscal developments have varied across emerging-market economies. In 2024, fiscal deficits were recorded in most emerging-market economies and rose in many of them (Figure 1.35, Panel A). The expansion of fiscal support in China and the new nationwide free school meal programme in Indonesia weighed on budget balances. In Colombia, the fiscal deficit increased as tax revenue falls outpaced spending cuts, and in Mexico as oil revenues fell. Fiscal balances also worsened in Bulgaria and Romania, due to continued spending pressures in social expenditure and public sector wages. In contrast, the Brazilian fiscal balance improved in 2024, partly due to one-off revenue measures. Budget balances also improved in India and South Africa.  53 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Based on announced policy plans, fiscal balances are projected to improve in most emerging-market economies in 2025-26 despite slowing growth. Türkiye is expected to continue consolidating as higher consumption taxes increase revenue and public investment is reduced further. Fiscal deficits in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru are projected to narrow as governments restrain spending and boost tax revenues, although they are projected to fall short of their fiscal targets in Colombia and Peru. India is also expected to consolidate further, partly by streamlining subsidies. In contrast, the fiscal deficit in Brazil is projected to persist in 2025, as there is limited political appetite for raising additional tax revenue, and to worsen in 2026 as growth slows. Fiscal balances are generally expected to improve in most countries in 2026, but the pace of improvement is projected to be relatively modest (Figure 1.35, Panels B and C). Emerging-market economies face a challenging environment. Amid rising debt and interest payments, they remain vulnerable to rapid shifts in risk sentiment and higher borrowing costs. They need to adjust to the changing global trade environment while preserving investor confidence and avoiding disorderly capital outflows. Countries should strive to meet fiscal consolidation targets, while ensuring that any support to help the economy adjust to changes in trade arrangements is targeted and temporary. In the medium to long-term, countries will need to reconcile fiscal sustainability with higher investment in human and physical capital, including for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and with steps to reinforce social safety nets. Addressing these trade-offs will require fiscal-structural reforms, such as enhancing spending efficiency, including by reducing untargeted subsidies, and improving revenue collection through curbing informality and broadening tax bases. Furthermore, strengthening fiscal institutions, such as fiscal rules and fiscal councils, might also lower financing costs and improve credibility (Alnafrah and Bogatov, 2025; Caldera Sanchez et al., 2024).

Countries should also not lose sight of the opportunities for potential benefits from collectively agreeing to lower the current tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services. In an illustrative scenario in which all countries act to lower their average effective tariff rates by 1½ percentage points (relative to those assumed in the baseline projections), global output would be raised by close to 0.3% by the third year and global inflation reduced by close to ¼ percentage point on average in the first three years (Figure 1.36; OECD, 2025b).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/ci0d7h Efforts to prevent further trade fragmentation should be coupled with reforms that strengthen the resilience of supply chains, including by encouraging firms to diversify both suppliers and buyers. Diversification would be aided by aligned regulatory standards on key intermediate production inputs between countries. This includes ongoing efforts to harmonise regulations between countries in the European Union. There is also additional scope to better align regulatory standards between sub-national jurisdictions. For example, in Canada, further eliminating differences in product and labour regulations and technical standards between provinces would better allow goods and services to flow to where they are most needed. Reforming trade facilitation procedures could also reduce trade costs and support greater diversification and depth in trade. Many countries have recently improved such procedures, by enhancing cooperation between border agencies both domestically and across countries. OECD estimates suggest that trade costs have declined by up to 5% over the last decade due to improvements in the efficiency of border processes, with the strongest effects in lower-income and lower middle-income economies (OECD 2025d; Figure 1.37). Further ambitious reforms to border agency co-operation, efforts to enhance the implementation of regulatory frameworks for trade facilitation, and to automate and simplify procedures could reduce delays and compliance costs and improve supply chain efficiency, potentially reducing trade costs by up to a further 12 percentage points (OECD, 2025d). Such improvements would help to boost the ability of exporters to find new markets and deepen existing trade relationships.  55 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.37.

Source: OECD (2025d). StatLink 2https://stat.link/rdza3c Lower barriers to trade in services would also promote trade flows. The OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index highlights the continued challenges of regulatory fragmentation and uneven conditions in access to services markets across countries (Figure 1.38, Panel A). This creates an uneven playing field which hampers trade in services as well as goods, because many services, such as logistics, are also crucial for global trade in goods. The pace and magnitude of services sector reforms were moderate in 2024 compared to 2023, with higher restrictions in all 22 services sectors and meaningful trade liberalisation in only a handful of sectors (OECD, 2025e). Ambitious policy reforms reducing services trade restrictiveness, equivalent to closing half the distance between current and best practice, could result in trade costs falling by around 11% in services sectors (OECD, 2024d; Figure 1.38, Panel B), with additional productivity benefits for manufacturers using services. This would be a significant potential offset to higher tariffs. Further efforts to support the digital delivery of services could also yield benefits. Raising digital connectivity between countries can support trade in goods as well as in services. However, digital services policy remains fragmented and increasingly restrictive. The OECD Digital Services Trade Restrictiveness Index shows that rising trade restrictions on digitally enabled services between 2014 and 2023 particularly affected access to communication infrastructure and connectivity (OECD, 2025e). Governments need to find an appropriate balance between safeguards and ensuring adequate competition in digital services. Trade tends to rise fastest when policies to lower trade facilitation costs are undertaken alongside significant improvements in the digital regulatory framework, highlighting the importance of carefully designed reforms to maximise the benefits for trade performance and competitiveness. 56  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.38.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/3axqg6 Rising protectionism and weak growth prospects also reinforce the need for governments to promote productivity and improve living standards through undertaking ambitious structural policy reforms. As discussed in Chapter 2, a strong focus should be policies to promote business investment that supports innovation and stronger growth in labour productivity. Investment prospects are now being damaged by the significant rise in policy uncertainty and this follows a marked slowdown in the pace of business investment in many economies since the financial crisis (Figure 1.39, Panel A). Only a small portion of this investment slowdown can be explained by weaker demand growth. Firms across OECD economies have increasingly invested in digital assets (Figure 1.39, Panel B), but the impact on net investment rates has been more than offset by weaker growth in traditional forms of capital investment and higher depreciation. Housing and public investment have also slowed in many countries, contributing to deteriorating housing affordability and public infrastructure.  57 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.39. Business investment gaps are large across OECD economies Note: In Panel A, the investment gap is calculated as the shortfall relative to predicted investment from a simple accelerator model that relates real business investment growth to its own lag and to current real output growth. Predicted real business investment is calculated from 2008 to 2023 as the fitted values from a model using actual growth rates of GDP and lagged investment. The overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend in 2023 is then decomposed into a part that is explained by the model, interpreted as demand (calculated as trend investment minus predicted investment) and an unexplained part, or “gap” (calculated as predicted investment minus actual investment, as a per cent of predicted investment).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0b6hm1 Weakening business investment has reflected structural factors in many economies. Despite rising profits, firms have shied away from fixed capital investment in favour of accumulating financial assets and returning funds to shareholders (OECD, 2025a). Across the OECD, the corporate sector has moved from being a net borrower to a net lender on aggregate since the financial crisis. This has coincided with an increase in required rates of return on investment, with the gap between the hurdle rates that businesses apply to investment decisions and capital costs having widened across countries (Figure 1.40). Identifying the factors behind sticky hurdle rates is fundamental for policymakers aiming to revive business investment growth. Elevated uncertainty, declining business dynamism and perceived difficulties in funding future investment in intangible assets are all factors that have been identified as playing a role in OECD economies (see Chapter 2). Against this backdrop, there are a range of structural policy reforms that can help revive business investment growth (see Chapters 2 and 3). Efforts to assuage policy uncertainty are key, as they would allow businesses to reduce the risk-premia they incorporate in hurdle rates. This is relevant across various policy dimensions, with specific approaches including conducting trade policy through a transparent and rules-based approach, outlining and implementing credible fiscal strategies, reducing complexity and improving transparency in regulatory policies and taking further credible steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change. 58  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 1.40.

Source: Gormsen and Huber (2023). StatLink 2https://stat.link/0tifmy Policies that promote business dynamism would also incentivise firms to innovate and invest as they strive to stay ahead of competitors. In many nascent industries, such as artificial intelligence, measures are often needed to lower barriers to firm entry and guard against firms building monopolistic positions. Given signs of reduced business dynamism in OECD economies (Calligaris, et. al. 2024), efforts to reduce the costs of regulations to businesses are needed. For example, there is significant scope to lower barriers to firm entry in capital-intensive network sectors, with new OECD simulations suggesting that deregulation in more highly regulated economies towards the regulatory levels of their least regulated peers is associated with an increase in the potential capital stock of up to 1.5% (Andrews et. al. 2025). Many countries also still lack adequate rules guaranteeing the transparency and accountability of lobbying activities. This regulatory void can benefit incumbents and well-funded corporations, enabling them to shape rules and the implementation of these rules in their favour at the expense of new entrants. Less punishing insolvency regimes and less prescriptive land use regulations are other key policy areas for promoting business dynamism, through their influence in supporting entrepreneurship and the growth of new businesses. Ensuring the availability of skilled labour will also be important for the expansion of high potential firms, both through a focus on lifelong learning policies and structural reforms that lower frictions in labour markets, such as reducing the prevalence of unnecessary non-compete clauses. Measures that facilitate better access to finance, especially for funding hard-to-collateralise intangible assets, can promote current investment spending by reducing the need for firms to save for future intangible investment spending. Improved depth of capital markets would support a more diverse range of funding options and promote competition between lenders. In Europe, making further progress on implementing the Savings and Investments Union will be important in this regard. Developing certain segments of capital markets that are more well-suited to funding intangibles than traditional banking systems may require some public financial support as well as regulatory changes. While remaining attuned to potential implications for financial stability, examples include adjusting regulatory restrictions on the investment activities of pension providers, public investment in venture capital markets and reducing administrative requirements on fintech lenders.  59 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 References Aerts, S., A.

Policy and other assumptions underlying the projections Fiscal policy settings for 2025-26 are based as closely as possible on legislated tax and spending provisions and are consistent with the growth, inflation and wage projections. Where government plans have been announced but not legislated, they are incorporated if it is deemed clear that they will be implemented in a shape close to that announced. It is assumed that EU countries generally adopt fiscal policy adjustments which are consistent with the reformed Stability and Growth Pact, apart from those member states where planned fiscal expansions are likely to require the activation of national escape clauses. Projections for the EU countries account for spending financed by the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) grants and loans, based on expert judgments about the distribution of spending across years and different expenditure categories and informed by officially announced plans where available. NGEU grants are assumed to be budget neutral, and increase both capital tax and transfers receipts and government expenditure. In addition, positive net one-offs are added in order to reflect the discretionary stimulus associated with those grants, as measured by changes in underlying primary balances. For monetary policy, the assumed path of policy interest rates and unconventional measures represents the most likely outcome, conditional upon the OECD projections of activity and inflation. This may differ from the stated path of the monetary authorities. In the euro area, 10-year sovereign spreads relative to Germany are assumed to remain constant over the projection period at levels close to those observed in the first half of May. The projections assume unchanged exchange rates from those prevailing on 9 May 2025: one US dollar equals JPY 145.2, EUR 0.89 (or equivalently one euro equals USD 1.13) and 7.24 renminbi. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is assumed to remain constant at USD 60 until the end of 2026. The TTF natural gas price is assumed to remain constant at EUR 35 MW/h until the end of 2026. Other commodity prices are assumed to be constant over the projection period at their average levels from April 2025. A technical assumption is made that the tariffs being applied as of mid-May 2025 remain in place throughout 2025 and 2026. It is also assumed that some disruptions to shipping in the Red Sea persist through 2025 and 2026. The cut-off date for information used in the projections is May 27, 2025. OECD quarterly projections are on a seasonal and working-day-adjusted basis for selected key variables. This implies that differences between adjusted and unadjusted annual data may occur, though these in general are quite small. In some countries, official forecasts of annual figures do not include working-day adjustments. Even when official forecasts do adjust for working days, the size of the adjustment may in some cases differ from that used by the OECD.  65 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Summary Weak investment has weighed on potential output growth since the global financial crisis (GFC), despite historically low financing costs and strong corporate profitability. Subdued aggregate demand and elevated uncertainty have dampened real business investment, but explain only around half of the investment shortfall since the GFC. In parallel, structural shifts, particularly the growing importance of digital assets and evolving corporate behaviour, have become more prominent. As economies have transitioned toward more digital and knowledge-intensive production – accelerated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – businesses have increasingly allocated investment toward software, data, computing hardware, and research and development. Firms have also channelled a lower share of their retained earnings and borrowed funds into productive investment, while requiring persistently high rates of return, or ‘hurdle rates’. These trends may be associated with underlying forces that restrain business investment and dynamism, including declining competitive pressures and the challenges in financing intangible investments. At the same time, residential investment has struggled to keep pace with strong housing demand, contributing to a steady erosion in affordability over the past few decades. Public investment – although showing some recent signs of recovery – has also been weak in many countries for an extended period. Against this backdrop, the chapter outlines policy approaches to support a revival in investment, including by reducing policy uncertainty, strengthening macroeconomic stability to support growth and advancing structural reforms to reinvigorate business dynamism. Policies that foster competition and improve access to finance are needed to unlock new investment opportunities and boost innovation in many countries. Reforms to ease land-use and planning restrictions and rental market regulations would help expand residential investment and improve affordability. Finally, high-quality public investment – particularly in energy security and green and digital infrastructure, research and development, health, and education – is needed in many economies and can help boost productivity and long-term economic growth. A prolonged period of weak investment has weighed on potential output growth Underlying growth prospects have weakened considerably over the past two decades, both in advanced and emerging-market economies. Weak growth in the capital stock has been an important factor behind the slowdown in potential output per capita growth in many countries, alongside a decline in multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth. Potential output per capita growth fell by 0.8 percentage points in the median advanced country and 0.9 percentage points in the median emerging-market economy between the 2002-2008 period and 2024. Weaker growth in capital per worker accounted for 0.5 percentage points of the decline in potential GDP per capita growth in the median advanced country, and 0.3 percentage points in the median emerging-market country. The slowdown in capital accumulation has weighed on potential growth across nearly all countries (Figure 2.1, Panel A), including those with relatively strong overall growth performance, such as India and China. 2. Reigniting investment for more resilient growth 66  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 The aggregate slowdown in capital accumulation masks notable cross-country differences (Figure 2.1, Panel B). In the advanced economies, capital stock growth has been particularly weak in Japan, Italy, Greece and Portugal during the past 15 years. The United States has observed steadier growth, albeit still below levels observed in the period before the GFC. Capital stocks in emerging-market economies have grown slightly faster on average than in advanced economies, reflecting greater investment needs. Nevertheless, some major emerging-market economies, such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, have seen weak capital stock growth, while others, such as Chile, have experienced high growth rates, but still a marked slowdown in capital stock growth over the past two decades. Figure 2.1. Weak capital accumulation has held back growth Note: Panel A: Other factors include changes in labour utilisation and multi-factor productivity. Capital deepening is the rate of change in the capital stock per worker. Panel B: annual average growth rate of the capital stock at constant prices.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/guel8r  67 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 The slowdown in capital accumulation largely reflects the lasting impact of two major shocks – the GFC and the COVID-19 pandemic – which led to notable declines in real investment from which most economies have recovered only partially. Total real investment, which measures the volume of gross fixed capital formation across the economy, contracted sharply during the GFC as economic growth weakened and financing conditions tightened. The subsequent recovery was relatively modest. Investment declined again during the pandemic, rebounding only partially thereafter, with other events such as Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and rising energy prices also weighing on capital formation. As a result, aggregate real investment volumes across advanced countries remained approximately 22% below their pre-GFC trend and 7% below the pre-COVID trend at end-2024 (Figure 2.2, Panel A). An investment shortfall is also evident in emerging markets, though it developed more gradually, as investment was less affected by the GFC than in advanced economies. Investment in emerging-market economies on average is estimated to be approximately 33% below the pre-GFC trend, although it is slightly above the pre-COVID trend due to recent robust growth in India and Indonesia (Figure 2.2, Panel B). This investment slowdown has been widespread across countries. Most have continued to see weak capital formation in recent years, with a few exceptions, such as the United States, India and Indonesia, where investment growth has been relatively strong. Figure 2.2. Real investment remains below the pre-GFC and pre-pandemic trends in many economies Real total investment Note: Real investment across 33 advanced economies and 13 emerging-market economies (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Romania, South Africa, Thailand, and Türkiye).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/i378g1 While the ratio of gross investment to GDP has risen in recent years in some countries, net investment - the addition to the capital stock after accounting for depreciation - remains weak across OECD countries. Since the pre-GFC period, average net investment rates across the OECD have declined by over 0.9 percentage points of GDP, from 2.5 to 1.6 per cent of GDP for the median country, with the fall in net investment strongest in the euro area. The overall decline in net investment has been primarily driven by the drop in business net investment - the largest share of total investment – though reductions in residential and public net investment have also contributed (Figure 2.3). The declines primarily reflect weakness in underlying investment volumes. The fall in prices of investment goods relative to overall prices played a significant role in the lower net investment-to-GDP ratios of the 1990s and early 2000s, but relative prices have since broadly stabilised in the post-GFC period. 68  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 2.3.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/i0l8cf Business investment has been held back by subdued demand, elevated uncertainty and structural factors Business investment, which accounts for over 60% of total investment in the average OECD country, has remained comparatively weak in most economies for which data are available. Notable exceptions are the United States and France, where business investment has grown more robustly. The weakness has been widespread, affecting most sectors (Figure 2.4, Panel A) and both large and small firms (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). Changes in the sectoral composition – such as an increasing share of less investment-intensive sectors such as services and a declining share of more capital-intensive manufacturing – seem to have played only a limited role. Instead, the decline in investment has been largely driven by within-sector dynamics (Figure 2.4, Panel B).  69 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 2.4. Business investment has been weak across sectors Note: In Panel A, the graph plots the coefficient β𝑠from the regression 𝑖𝑐,𝑡 𝑠 = α𝑐 𝑠 + β𝑠 × 𝑡 + ϵ𝑐,𝑡 𝑠 for each sector s, showing the average annual change in the net investment rate over the period 1997-2021, expressed in percentage points. This approach controls for country-specific time invariant factors. The sample covers the period from 1997 to 2021, and countries shown in Panel B, with the net investment ratio defined as gross fixed capital formation minus consumption of fixed capital, divided by value added, all in current prices. In Panel B, the graph presents a shift-share analysis for all countries with available data. This analysis decomposes changes in the investment rate into two components: a within-industry effect (reflecting investment changes within sector) and a between-industry effect (reflecting investment shifts in sectoral composition), following the methodology of Autor and Salomons (2018). Source: OECD National Accounts database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/uxm0f4 Aggregate demand accounts for part of the weakness but investment ‘gaps’ remain One key factor contributing to the weakness in business investment relative to earlier trends is more subdued growth in aggregate demand. In many countries, real output fell sharply following both the GFC and the pandemic, and recovered only partially relative to its pre-crisis trend. Corporate investment is closely linked to output growth, as stronger demand incentivises firms to expand capacity. Empirical analysis based on an accelerator model suggests that weak aggregate demand is an important factor explaining business investment performance. Yet, it accounts for only around one-third of the overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend (Figure 2.5, Panel A) on average, for the 17 countries with available data. In contrast, the accelerator model suggests that business investment was broadly in line with output growth in the period leading up to the financial crisis. The remaining shortfall may be viewed as an investment ‘gap’, defined as the shortfall in investment not attributable to output developments. This investment ‘gap’ is around 17% of the predicted investment level on average and is even larger in some countries – exceeding 30% in Australia, Korea, and the Netherlands (Figure 2.5, Panel B). 70  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Investment gaps have widened over time, pointing to the growing importance of non-demand factors in explaining weak investment. In the immediate wake of the GFC (2008-2011), the gap was small, suggesting that demand effects accounted for most of the investment weakness, although credit supply and debt overhangs may also have contributed. Between 2012 and 2019, the gap widened gradually, and from 2020 onward, the COVID-19 shock contributed to a further increase. On average, developments since 2020 account for roughly one-quarter of the unexplained slowdown in investment. The impact of the pandemic on the investment gap has been particularly sizeable in some countries, such as Belgium, Denmark and Sweden (Figure 2.5, Panel B). Figure 2.5. Business investment ‘gaps’ are large across OECD economies Decomposition of shortfalls in real business investment compared to pre-GFC trend Note: The investment gap is calculated as the shortfall relative to predicted investment from a simple accelerator model that relates real business investment growth to its own lag and to current real output growth (Annex 2.A). Predicted real business investment is calculated from 2008 to 2023 as the fitted values from the model using actual growth rates of GDP and lagged investment. The overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend in 2023 is then decomposed into a part that is explained by the model, interpreted as demand (calculated as trend investment minus predicted investment) and an unexplained part, or ‘gap’ (calculated as predicted investment minus actual investment, as a per cent of predicted investment). The country sample includes 17 OECD countries for which data on real business investment are available. Panel A shows the results for the OECD aggregate, calculated as a weighted average of the countries in Panel B using GDP PPP weights. Panel B shows investment gaps in per cent of predicted investment, for countries with available data. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/vjcbw1 Investment ‘gaps’ cannot be fully explained by the cost of capital, company valuations and profitability Business investment gaps have opened up despite a marked decline in the user cost of capital (UCC) across most economies. The UCC, which captures the cost of financing and maintaining capital –factoring in borrowing costs, relative prices, taxes, and depreciation – has trended downward steadily over the past few decades until the recent moves to tighten monetary policy (Figure 2.6, Panel A). Borrowing costs dropped to historically low levels following the monetary policy easing in response to the GFC, and while they have risen more recently, they remain well below long-term averages (Figure 2.6, Panel B). Effective corporate tax rates have also declined, with several OECD countries having reduced the main statutory rate (Figure 2.6, Panel C), and changes to tax provisions have further lowered the effective cost of capital in some countries. Simultaneously, the price of investment goods relative to overall output prices fell throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, largely due to sustained improvements in the quality and efficiency of ICT-related capital (Figure 2.6, Panel C).  71 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 At the same time, corporate valuations have remained favourable to higher investment. When the ratio of a firm's market valuation to the replacement cost of its assets (Tobin’s Q) is above one, markets expect firms can earn returns on new investment that exceed investment costs. Firm-level data from listed companies in a subset of OECD countries indicate that Tobin’s Q has remained above this threshold since the GFC. In the United States and some Scandinavian countries, valuations have risen strongly in recent years, whereas valuations have been flat or increased only gradually in most European and other advanced economies (Figure 2.6, Panel D).1 Figure 2.6. The cost of capital has fallen and company valuations have held up Note: Panel A: The user cost of capital UCC is calculated using the relative price of investment, the real interest rate based on the 10-year government bond yield and 10-year ahead inflation expectations from professional forecasts, the depreciation rate, the statutory corporate tax rate and the share of debt in corporate liabilities (debt plus equity). Panel C: The relative price of investment is measured as the ratio of the investment and GDP deflators. Panel D: Tobin's Q is calculated as the sum of market capitalisation and liabilities, minus common equity, divided by total assets using Worldscope data. In Panels A, B and C, the country sample includes 15 OECD countries for which data are available (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Median values are shown. In Panel D, for Europe, the median is calculated using data from a subset of countries with larger stock markets, covering Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The ‘Other’ category represents the median of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; OECD National accounts database; Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation Database; LSEG Worldscope Fundamentals; Consensus Economics; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/bpkizw 1 Differences in the valuation of firms in advanced economies and their US counterparts may be driven by several factors. These include the traditionally stronger institutional framework in the United States —including corporate governance standards and financial market infrastructure—greater market capacity to absorb global risks, and higher expectations for future investment returns (La Porta et al., 1998). The relative undervaluation of “brown” firms (those with higher carbon emissions) in other developed countries, compared to the United States, may also contribute to this premium (Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz, 2020). 72  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Firms’ profitability and cash resources also do not appear to have acted as constraints. Subdued corporate investment in advanced economies since the GFC has coincided with the corporate sector shifting from being a net borrower to net lender on aggregate (Figure 2.7, Panel A). Gross corporate savings as a share of GDP have increased in more than half of the OECD countries with available data, driven by stronger profits, proportionally lower tax payments, and lower interest expenditures, although this has been partially offset by higher dividends in some countries including the United States, Canada and the Netherlands (Figure 2.7, Panel B). Overall, the ratio of net investment to net sales has also declined, implying that higher sales have not been proportionally matched with higher investment. Taken together, this suggests that capital costs, valuation signals and firms’ profitability cannot explain the weakness in business investment. Moreover, proxy measures of the UCC, Tobin’s Q and firms’ profitability are not statistically significant when added to the accelerator model (see Annex 2.A), pointing instead to the growing importance of other determinants in explaining investment, particularly since 2012. These are likely to include heightened economic uncertainty and structural factors, such as changing investment patterns towards digital assets and evolving corporate behaviour. Figure 2.7. Strong corporate profitability has not translated into higher gross fixed capital investment Note: Panel A contains 33 OECD countries. It shows gross fixed capital formation and gross savings for the non-financial corporate sector as a per cent of nominal GDP, aggregated up to the OECD level. The difference between gross fixed capital investment and gross savings is approximately equal to net lending, but can vary depending on changes in inventories, other non-financial produced assets, and net capital transfers. In Panel B, the decomposition is based on the distribution of income account for the non-financial corporate sector within the System of National Accounts: Gross operating surplus = Gross saving + Net property income paid + Current taxes on income + Social transfers + Other transfers, where Net property income paid = Dividends - reinvested earnings on foreign direct investment + net interest paid + rents on land (for more information see (Chen, Loukas and Brent, 2017)). Source: OECD National Accounts database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/e253dn Elevated uncertainty is likely to have held back investment Elevated uncertainty – both macroeconomic and policy related – is likely to have weighed on investment incentives and encouraged precautionary cash accumulation. Firms may hesitate to commit to long-term capital spending projects when the outlook for global demand, trade policy, or regulatory frameworks is unclear. Economic policy uncertainty indicators started to increase steadily around 2016, and trade policy uncertainty became elevated in the 2017-2020 period (Figure 2.8, Panel A). Empirical estimates (Box 2.1) suggest policy uncertainty may have accounted for approximately one-sixth of the overall investment shortfall relative to the pre-GFC trend (Figure 2.5, Panel A), and around one-quarter of the ‘gap’ across OECD countries (Figure 2.5, Panel B). Furthermore, recent survey evidence suggests that uncertainty is increasingly a major obstacle to investment for firms (Figure 2.8, Panel B).  73 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 More recently, measures of policy uncertainty have spiked due to heightened concerns about economic risks from tariffs on international trade. Estimates suggest that if these levels of high-uncertainty persist, the resulting decline in investment growth could lead to real investment being up to 1.4 percentage points lower by end-2026 (Box 2.1). In contrast, if policy uncertainty reverts to the average levels observed over the 2015-2019 period, investment could be 1.8 percentage points higher by end-2026 compared to a baseline where economic policy uncertainty remains at current levels. Figure 2.8. Uncertainty has increased, becoming a greater obstacle to investment Note: For Panel A, the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) is based on Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016) and the Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) index is from Caldara et al (2019).

The TPU index is based on automated text searches of the electronic archives of seven newspapers. Panel B shows the share of firms responding positively to the survey question Q.38 in the European Investment Bank EIB) Investment Survey: ‘Thinking about your investment activities, to what extent is each of the following an obstacle? Is it a major obstacle, a minor obstacle or not an obstacle at all?’, the average score is shown for EU countries and the United States.

Economic policy uncertainty and business investment in OECD countries Policy uncertainty has increased sharply in recent months across OECD countries. Elevated uncertainty can be a drag on business investment as firms often delay or scale back capital spending when future conditions are unclear. Earlier studies have found that the increase in US economic policy uncertainty in the 2005-2012 period was associated with a peak decline of 6% in US gross fixed investment (Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2016). Focusing on trade policy uncertainty, an increase equivalent to that observed during the 2018 period of higher tariffs has been found to be associated with a decline in private investment of 1-2% (Caldara et al., 2019). The impact of policy uncertainty on investment in OECD economies is quantified using a panel Vector Autoregression (VAR) model with quarterly data. The model includes real business investment, GDP, the GDP deflator, short-term interest rates and a measure of economic uncertainty, the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, developed by Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016), capturing both country-specific and global shocks. Results suggest that a one standard deviation increase in economic policy uncertainty reduces business investment growth by around 1 percentage point after one year, with the impact peaking after four quarters (Figure 2.9). This suggests that the increase in uncertainty during recent years may have reduced 74  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 annual investment growth by 0.4 percentage points on average across OECD countries, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the investment ‘gap’ shown in Figure 2.5. To illustrate the potential future implications, two scenarios are considered: • Lower economic policy uncertainty would lift investment growth. In a “confidence rebound scenario” where uncertainty declines from its value at the end of 2024 to the average levels over the 2015-2019 period by end-2025, the associated cumulative gain in business investment would be around 1.8 percentage points by end-2026 as compared to a baseline where economic policy uncertainty remains at current levels. • However, if current levels of high uncertainty persist and only decline towards their 2024 average, the resulting decline in investment growth could lead to real investment being 1.4 percentage points lower by end-2026.

An uncertainty shock decreases business investment and GDP Note: Panels show the impact of a one standard deviation increase in economic policy uncertainty on business investment (Panel A) and GDP (Panel B). Grey shaded areas depict 90% confidence bands. The results are based on a panel VAR model for nine OECD countries with available data on business investment and economic policy uncertainty (Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States). The panel VAR specification features four lags of growth rates of GDP, GDP deflator, business investment, economic policy uncertainty (Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2016), the first difference of short-term interest rates and a linear trend. The model is estimated at quarterly frequency over 1997Q1 to 2024Q4. The identification of the structural shock to economic policy uncertainty rests on a Cholesky triangularisation of the variance-covariance matrix of the reduced-form residuals.

The remaining weakness is likely to be related to broader structural changes within the economy. As economies transition toward more digital and knowledge-intensive production – accelerated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – investment has increasingly shifted toward intangibles, especially digital assets. At the same time, firms have channelled a lower share of their retained earnings and borrowed funds into productive investment, while maintaining persistently high required rates of return, or ‘hurdle rates’. Both these trends are likely to be associated with underlying factors that dampen investment, including declining competitive pressures and the rise of dominant firms, particularly in the digital sector, and difficulties in financing intangible investments. Investment in digital and knowledge-based assets has increased The transition towards a more digital and knowledge-intensive economy in recent years has had a significant impact on the composition of business investment. Investment has been channelled into knowledge-based intangible assets, such as software, data, and research and development (R&D), and complementary tangible investments, such as ICT hardware, including servers, networking equipment, and cloud infrastructure (André and Gal, 2024). Together, these assets are an important driver of firm productivity and innovation (Corrado et al., 2021). Real investment in digital and knowledge assets has outpaced other asset classes across most advanced economies (Figure 2.10). Real investment in software has increased three-fold since 2008 on average in OECD economies, while investment in ICT hardware and R&D has grown by around 100% and 45%, respectively, over the same period, compared to aggregate growth of 12% for machinery and a 7% decline in investment in structures. Digital investment has expanded particularly rapidly in countries such as the United States and France, which have also seen strong growth in overall investment. In contrast, several countries, including Germany, have witnessed more modest increases. Investment has expanded particularly rapidly in tech-related firms (Figure 2.11). Firm-level data also show that AI-related companies invest in physical capital at nearly twice the rate of other firms, with their R&D investment rates more than three times higher (Figure 2.12). At the same time, firms appear to not be undertaking all the available profitable marginal investments that lower costs of finance should encourage. The average pre-tax rate of return on corporate capital assets has remained high in many economies in recent years, after dropping during the GFC and pandemic (Figure 2.15, Panel A). There is also evidence that required returns on investment have increased, since the gap between hurdle rates – the minimum expected return a firm requires to proceed with an investment – and capital costs has widened (Figure 2.16, Panels A and B) (OECD, 2015; Shah, Bunn and Melolinna, 2024). While rising policy uncertainty may have contributed to higher risk premia and thus higher hurdle rates, the scale of the increase points to additional underlying structural factors. 76  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 2.10.

There are some known issues around the measurement of R&D in company accounts which are examined in forthcoming OECD work (OECD, 2025a). Source: LSEG Worldscope Fundamentals; and OECD calculations. The relatively stronger growth of digital and knowledge-based investment has not been sufficient to offset the impact of rising depreciation and weak tangible investment. Thus, net business investment as a share of GDP has declined across most OECD countries, despite a notable rise in digital and R&D investment (Figure 2.3). This decline reflects sluggish growth in traditional tangible investment categories — such as infrastructure and machinery — which still account for the largest share of business investment, alongside the higher depreciation rates for digital and knowledge-based capital (Figure 2.13, Panels A and B). On average, digital and knowledge-based assets now make up just over 35% of total capital formation, in current prices, up from around 28% at the turn of the century (Figure 2.13, Panel C).2 As investment has shifted toward these faster-depreciating assets, the overall depreciation or ‘scrapping’ rate has risen. 2 Despite ongoing enhancements to the National Accounts, some types of intangible assets are still not captured in business investment statistics, such as organisational and marketing capital. Some attempts have been made to measure these newer types of intangibles, suggesting that around half of intangible investments are not captured in official national accounts (Corrado et al., 2021). 78  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 2.13.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/k83o0q Corporate behaviour has shifted towards greater cash accumulation, higher shareholder payouts and rising required returns Instead of investing in fixed assets, firms have increasingly allocated savings toward accumulating financial assets or distributed earnings to investors through dividends and share buybacks. The increase in corporate net financial asset positions has been predominantly associated with the accumulation of financial assets rather than reductions in debt (Figure 2.14, Panel A). Firm-level data suggest that rising corporate gross operating surpluses have been associated with increased cash holdings and higher shareholder payouts, mainly through dividends (Figure 2.14, Panels C and D). In the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, share buybacks have also contributed significantly to this trend.3 Concurrently, the number and value of corporate mergers and acquisitions remained elevated during much of the post-GFC period, particularly in the United States and Europe, indicating that financial resources were utilised to acquire existing capital assets from other companies, rather than to expand the overall capital stock through internal investments (Figure 2.14, Panels E and F). Another possible use of corporate savings would be to invest in other countries, but there is little sign of this in outward foreign direct investment flows from the major economies, other than in Japan (Figure 2.14, Panel B). 3 The low cost of borrowing may also have incentivised firms to undertake non-investment financial activities such as leveraged buybacks and debt refinancing. See Chapter 2 of the Global Debt Report 2025, (OECD, 2025b).  79 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 2.14.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1jgaxn Shifts in the composition of investment and corporate behaviour have coincided with rising market concentration, higher markups and difficulties in accessing finance Market concentration has risen and business dynamism declined across advanced economies. These developments are increasingly linked to weak investment (Calligaris et al., 2024). Measures of industry concentration have risen in Europe and the United States, while product market concentration has also increased in European economies (Figure 2.17). At the same time, data from listed firms show a notable increase in markups – measured as the ratio of total revenue to the cost of goods sold – across most  81 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 advanced economies, with Italy being a notable exception (Figure 2.18). 4 Among emerging-market economies, markups have increased in India and South Africa but eased slightly in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia and Mexico. Net investment rates among listed firms have declined in all countries apart from Korea over the same period. In parallel with rising market concentration, business investment has also become increasingly concentrated among a small group of highly profitable “superstar” firms (Autor, 2020). This trend is closely linked to shifts in the composition of investment, as the greater scalability of intangible assets tends to boost returns for a limited number of firms, reinforcing “winner-takes-most” dynamics (Haksel and Westlake, 2018). The rise in overall market power appears particularly pronounced in the digital sector (Nicoletti, Vitale and Abate, 2023). These dynamics are further reinforced by growing concentration in institutional ownership. The widespread use of passive investment vehicles and consolidation in the asset management sector mean that many competing firms now share common large shareholders (Schmalz, 2017). Ownership concentration can weaken incentives for competition and has been associated with lower corporate investment (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2018; Azar, Schmalz and Tecu, 2018). Figure 2.17. Industry and product market concentration has increased Concentration trends in industries and product markets Note: The chart is taken from (Calligaris et al., 2025) and shows the unweighted average across industry- or product- country combinations of the cumulative growth of market concentration.

Increased market concentration can suppress investment through several channels. One is that dominant firms may restrict output and raise prices rather than invest in expanding capacity, particularly when competitive pressure is limited (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017). Another mechanism is that only large ‘superstar’ firms have the financial resources, managerial capability, and know-how to make large-scale investments with uncertain payback periods, effectively crowding out investment by smaller, less productive, or new firms (Crouzet and Eberly, 2019). Firm-level data suggests that large firms account for a higher share of investment relative to their output, although the gap has not increased over time (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). In reality, the relationship between market power and investment is likely to be nuanced, and firm specific. For example, firms may first achieve market power through innovation and efficiency, gaining scale through network effects and intangible synergies. Over time, however, some may shift their focus from innovation and fixed capital investment toward rent-seeking strategies, such as regulatory capture and lobbying, to preserve their dominant position (Akcigit and Ates, 2021). The availability of finance is a second key channel connecting the observed rise in intangible assets and precautionary corporate behaviour such as cash accumulation and high hurdle rates. Investment in software, data, and R&D as well as other intangibles, is harder to finance through bank loans, as these assets are more difficult to value and hence use as collateral. As a result, firms may need to self-finance these assets through retained earnings and higher cash holdings to reduce dependence on external financing (Demmou, Stefanescu, and Arquie, 2019), reducing available resources for investment. These constraints can be particularly binding for smaller firms and those operating in bank-based financial systems with less developed capital markets. Taken together, increased market concentration and financing challenges for intangibles provide additional plausible explanations for the persistent weakness in business investment. The relative importance of these factors likely varies across countries, sectors, and firms. Other factors may also have played a role. Rising investment costs – including limited land availability, planning delays, regulatory burdens, and implementation capacity constraints – can also deter firms from launching new projects. Moreover, the growing tendency of firms to prioritise shareholder payouts over reinvestment may reflect increasing financialisation (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017) and incentives such as shareholder pressure to shift corporate strategy toward maximising short-term financial returns at the expense of long-term productive investment.  83 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Other structural trends – such as ageing populations and labour shortages - may also have restrained business investment, particularly in advanced economies. When firms anticipate slower growth in the working-age population, they may revise down expected demand for goods and services, reducing the need to expand productive capacity. This may more than offset any stimulative effects on investment from the downward pressure on real interest rates associated with higher savings in ageing populations — although this effect may also wane as retirees dissave (Eggertsson, Mehrotra and Robbins, 2019). Meanwhile, persistent skill shortages have emerged in some countries and sectors (OECD, 2024a), with over 50% of EU and US firms identifying the scarcity of skilled staff as a major obstacle to investment (Figure 2.21 Panel B). If firms are unable to find the necessary skills to implement, operate or maintain new capital – and fully reap their benefits -, they may postpone investment projects, particularly high-skill, high-tech investments that require complementary human capital, such as ICT and green technology.5 Housing investment has fallen short of demand, reducing affordability Residential housing investment accounts for around a fifth of total of total investment across OECD countries and has also slowed in recent decades (Figure 2.19, Panel A). Following a period of strong housing investment in some economies prior to the GFC, the subsequent tightening in credit conditions, household deleveraging, and the marked downturn in many housing markets contributed to a dramatic fall in residential investment during 2008-09.6 Although growth in housing investment eventually recovered, the past decade has seen a further steady decline. This was interrupted only briefly by a spike in activity following the pandemic in the context of low interest rates, increased demand for larger living spaces and government support measures. Real housing investment has contracted in recent years and continued to do so in most OECD countries over the year to the fourth quarter of 2024. A structural shortfall in housing investment relative to demand has contributed to rising house prices. Several factors have fuelled housing demand, including urbanisation, population growth, rising incomes, increased immigration, a shift toward smaller households, and greater access to mortgage credit (OECD, 2021). The supply-demand imbalance is a key reason why house prices and rents in many OECD countries have risen significantly faster than both inflation and household incomes over time, eroding affordability. These pressures are particularly acute in major cities and economically dynamic regions, where growth in demand for housing has far outpaced supply. Consequently, housing costs have absorbed an increasing share of household budgets, often at the expense of other essential spending categories such as food and transport (Figure 2.19, Panel B). Between 2000 and 2023, the share of consumption spent on housing rose by an average of close to three percentage points, reaching 17% in the median OECD country. The low responsiveness of housing supply to growing demand reflects a range of structural and regulatory constraints (OECD, 2021). The time required for planning and construction means supply adjustments are sticky, allowing price pressures to build up. In addition, rising construction and renovation costs (OECD, 2023), partly driven by stricter energy efficiency and environmental sustainability standards, have added to overall investment costs. Demand has been particularly concentrated in job-rich urban areas, where geographical limitations and regulatory restrictions, including land-use and zoning rules, are most restrictive (Cournède, De Pace and Ziemann, 2020). Other factors, such as rental market regulations, landlord-tenant laws, and labour shortages also affect the efficient functioning of housing markets and the construction sector, potentially discouraging investment in both the construction and maintenance 5 In other instances, companies in industries facing major shortages may choose to automate parts of their production instead, leading to increased investment in tangible capital (Dorville, Filippucci and Marcolin, forthcoming). 6 In some countries, housing investment growth prior to the GFC was excessive, with residential investment rising well above historical averages and exceeding 8% of GDP, including Spain and Ireland and reflected in surges in mortgage credit and household debt-to-GDP ratios. 84  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 of dwellings. In addition, persistently low productivity growth in the housing construction sector—often attributed to regulatory factors—may further undermine cost-efficiency and scalability (D’Amico et al., 2024).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/mzgpkh Public investment has picked up but remains below pre-GFC levels Public investment – accounting for around one sixth of total investment across OECD countries – declined significantly in many economies in the aftermath of the GFC. The decline was largely due to fiscal consolidation efforts, particularly in euro area countries that faced acute sovereign debt pressures (OECD, 2015). In contrast, the policy response to the pandemic was different, with many governments raising public investment to support the recovery (Figure 2.20, Panel A). This was especially evident in the European Union, where initiatives such as the NextGenerationEU funds have played a central role in boosting investment. A substantial share of these recovery packages was directed towards investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable transport infrastructure to support demand and progress toward long-term climate goals. Despite the recent upturn in some countries, critical public investment needs remain. Net public investment – after accounting for the depreciation of the existing capital stock – remains below pre-GFC levels (Figure 2.3, Panel C), raising concerns about deteriorating infrastructure in some countries and sectors. The stock of public capital relative to GDP has stagnated or declined over the past decade in many countries. Marked sectoral differences have emerged: while the share of public investment has increased in areas such as energy, defence, and healthcare, other sectors such as transport have declined (Figure 2.20, Panel B). Such declines can lead to quality shortfalls. The perceived quality of transport infrastructure declined in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, in the years prior to the pandemic (World Economic Forum, 2019), while declines in education performance were signalled by PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) scores declining across many OECD countries between 2018 and 2022. Moreover, insufficient public investment may also constrain private investment, as inadequate transportation, energy or digital infrastructure can limit firms’ growth and investment opportunities.  85 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Recent announcements of further increases in defence spending – particularly among European countries in response to heightened geopolitical tensions – are expected to result in some increase in public spending. However, the overall boost to public investment may be modest, as only around 20% of defence spending tends to be allocated to capital investment (see Chapter 1). Figure 2.20.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4l2j5z Public policy reforms can help reinvigorate investment Public policies help shape the factors identified above as underpinning recent investment trends. Clear and predictable measures that incentivise business investment are particularly important, given business investment has been the main component behind the weakness in net aggregate investment across countries. Key messages from the analysis above are the importance of reducing policy uncertainty, promoting competition and business dynamism and alleviating financing constraints for intangible investment. These are consistent with many of the country-specific policy recommendations for boosting investment in Chapter 3 and summarised in Panel A of Figure 2.21, and would help overcome some of the key obstacles to investment commonly cited by businesses (Figure 2.21, Panel B). Outside of the business sector, there is scope to boost housing investment in some countries through regulatory reforms that include the easing of land-use restrictions and rental market regulations. In addition, high-quality public investment – particularly in green and digital infrastructure, research and development, health, and education – is needed in many economies and can boost potential output growth, especially if it crowds-in private investment spending. 86  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 2.21.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/vnz762 Reducing policy uncertainty would support stronger investment growth Clear and predictable public policy is needed to assuage economic policy uncertainty and help rejuvenate investment growth, as highlighted in Box 1. While the predominant factor behind the recent rise in economic policy uncertainty in advanced economies has been higher trade policy uncertainty, available measures also show increased uncertainty since early 2024 in categories related to fiscal, regulatory and climate policies. As such, improving the general clarity and predictability of economic policies in all areas of government could underpin stronger investment rates. This is a policy recommendation contained in many of the country notes in Chapter 3, including for the United States, Hungary, Korea and Türkiye. One potential channel is that reduced uncertainty could prompt businesses to reduce the risk-premia  87 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 incorporated in the hurdle rates used for investment decisions (European Investment Bank, 2024). Specific approaches to reduce policy uncertainty may include: • Conducting trade policy through a transparent and rules-based system with efforts made by governments to avoid introducing sudden policy changes that are unpredictable for businesses and consumers. Working together within the global trading system to find ways of addressing concerns with current trading arrangements could also help governments provide certainty about the future. • Reducing fiscal policy uncertainty by legislating and implementing credible medium-term strategies for achieving sustainable public finances amid rising fiscal pressures (e.g. from population ageing, climate change and defence spending). Strengthening fiscal frameworks by reinforcing transparent, rules-based approaches – while ensuring that fiscal rules are designed with well-defined, credible escape clauses – can help maintain policy credibility while preserving flexibility in the face of major shocks. Implementing stable and predictable tax rules, combined with clear dispute resolution mechanisms, can also help mitigate uncertainty (Box 2.3). • Reducing complexity and improving transparency around domestic structural policy changes in areas such as regulation of product and labour markets, migration policy and the financial system. Undertaking robust and transparent regulatory impact assessments would help give investors greater certainty. In addition, efforts to build a strong consensus around structural reforms by working with key stakeholders will support their longevity. • Affirming ongoing international commitments to mitigate climate change and outlining the policy approach to achieving climate commitments. At the same time, implementing well-designed adaptation measures that minimise the potential economic cost of future disruptions from climate change would provide greater certainty about the future operating environment. Various framework conditions shape the incentives to invest Policies and institutional arrangements shape the incentives of firms to invest, their ability to attract the required resources to do so and overall economic stability. Sound macroeconomic policies and a healthy financial system are the foundation of strong and resilient investment growth. Monetary policy should focus on achieving low and stable inflation and any additional statutory objectives. In some emerging market and developing economies, additional efforts to entrench credible monetary policy frameworks could provide greater monetary policy certainty and help anchor inflation expectations. In addition, macroprudential policy tools should be developed and deployed where necessary to guard against the build-up of systemic financial risks that might become the basis for future financial shocks and impede access to finance. Structural reforms can promote business dynamism and encourage firms to sharpen their focus on innovating and investing to stay ahead of competitors. Reducing the cost of regulations to businesses, both through reforming de jure regulations and implementing them in a way that does not unnecessarily raise costs, promotes firm entry and the ability of successful firms to expand. This can help mitigate trends towards rising market concentration, including in markets based around new intangible assets such as artificial intelligence technologies. Country-specific policy recommendations to promote investment by improving aspects of competition policy are made in the majority of country notes in Chapter 3 (Figure 2.21, Panel A). In emerging-market economies, clear and predictable regulatory frameworks can also reassure foreign investors about the operating environment. While, in theory, more restrictive domestic regulations could simply encourage firms to invest abroad, this is only an option for a subset of firms in certain sectors, with foreign investment more likely to be determined by a need to enter foreign markets, or acquire resources, or link to research or financial centres. Indeed, the available evidence does not support the notion that foreign investment is a substitute for domestic investment (Desai et al., 2005; Goldbach et al., 2019), with the importance of a wide variety of structural policies for domestic investment growth empirically well established (Égert, 2021). 88  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 New OECD estimates indicate that reducing product market regulation in network industries is associated with an increase in the capital stock in downstream business sectors. Policy experiments suggest that network sector deregulation between 1980 and 2023 could have raised the capital stock by around 4% in the average OECD economy, with gains reaching 10% in manufacturing and 5% in business services (Figure 2.22, Panel A). Looking ahead, bringing regulations in more highly-regulated economies towards the regulatory levels of their least-regulated peers could raise the economy-wide capital stock by up to 1.5%, with notably larger impacts for the manufacturing sector (Figure 2.22, Panel B). The effective design and implementation of product market regulations can also be hampered by the influence of lobbying activities. Reforms that improve the transparency and accountability of lobbying could address this and weaken the potential for regulations to be captured by incumbent firms and fuel rising market concentration (OECD, 2024b). Figure 2.22. Investment would benefit from further product market reforms Note: Panel A estimates are based on Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares regression results of how upstream regulation in network sectors, captured by the OECD’s REGIMPACT indicator, affects the capital stock (see Andrews et al. 2025 for further details). Panel B shows the potential capital stock gains from three reform scenarios that are based on measures of barriers to entry in network sectors in 2023: (1) convergence of the three most regulated OECD countries to the regulatory levels of the three least regulated (in orange); (2) convergence of the most regulated countries to the OECD average (in green); and (3) convergence of the OECD average to the benchmark set by the three least regulated countries (in blue).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/9hswyg Well-functioning insolvency frameworks promote business dynamism by encouraging firms to invest and resources to be efficiently allocated from weaker exiting businesses to higher performing ones. At the same time, overly stringent bankruptcy regimes can deter risk-taking, weighing on innovation and bias firms’ choice of capital structure towards tangible investments at the expense of intangibles (Garcia-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2014). This is highlighted by OECD analysis showing that the economic gains from lowering barriers to efficient corporate restructuring increase with a sector’s intangible asset intensity (André and Demmou, 2022). Many countries have undertaken important reforms to insolvency frameworks over the past decade. Between 2016 and 2022, there was particularly notable progress in Europe and Canada (André and Demmou, 2022). Nonetheless, there remains scope for additional regulatory efforts in most countries to streamline insolvency processes, refine restructuring tools and improve the treatment of failed entrepreneurs.  89 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 The stringency and complexity of land use regulations influence business dynamism and housing investment by determining the activities that can be undertaken in a certain location. More stringent and complex land use provisions can be a barrier to firm entry and moderate investment in physical assets in some sectors such as retail trade, as well as dwelling investment. Reducing complexity and introducing greater flexibility in zoning systems, including by being less prescriptive about the specific activities that can be undertaken on a parcel of land, can enable firm entry and growth, as well as the ability of the economy to adapt to ongoing structural change. Based on the country notes in Chapter 3, such recommendations appear to be particularly relevant in Australia, Austria, Croatia and Sweden. Sub\u0002national governments are often responsible for land use regulations and the implementation of planning approvals. Ensuring these administrations have sufficient fiscal incentives to reduce the complexity of regulations and streamline approvals can be important. An example is Switzerland, where local government finances are heavily reliant on property taxation and there is significant flexibility afforded to authorities to set the applicable tax rates. Efforts to harmonise regulations across sub-national jurisdictions and minimise responsibility overlaps could also reduce the cost of business investment, as well as promote spending on the housing stock. Indeed, a high degree of decentralisation of land-use decisions and responsibility overlaps are empirically associated with high rigidity of housing supply (Bétin and Ziemann, 2019). As discussed earlier, overly strict rental market regulations have inhibited housing investment in some countries. Regulations such as rent controls and landlord-tenant rules can provide protections for renters but may also reduce incentives to invest in rental housing due to lower rental revenues and the greater difficulty of selling properties (Kholodilin and Kohl, 2020). For instance, rent controls in San Francisco are estimated to have reduced housing supply by as much as 15% (Diamond, McQuade and Qian, 2019). OECD work has found that the house price elasticity of residential construction is considerably lower where there is stringent rental market regulation (Cavalleri, Cournède and Özsöğüt, 2019). Minimising regulatory barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) can help facilitate the best allocation of global investment and enhance competition. Capital spending may increase in both source and destination countries when vertical FDI is involved, leading to the buildup of global value chains. Nonetheless, as measured by the OECD FDI regulatory restrictiveness index, policy restrictions on inward FDI are high in some economies, especially in emerging-market economies (Figure 2.23). This may have contributed to the modest FDI inflows observed in recent years (Figure 2.14, Panel B). A renewed drive to ease or eliminate FDI policy barriers could support such inflows and capital spending in destination countries. According to the country-specific recommendations in Chapter 3, such a policy approach may be particularly relevant in Costa Rica, Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam, as well as in some advanced economies such as Korea, New Zealand and Switzerland. 90  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 2.23.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/qkigsw Policies that reduce financing frictions for intangible investment can alleviate the need for firms to retain cash resources to self-finance future intangible investment projects. It may also help enable young and small firms to undertake investment projects, promoting competitive pressures in more concentrated markets. Financial frictions can be especially acute in bank-based financial systems for firms without traditional forms of collateral. Such firms include those with a high proportion of knowledge-based assets and start-ups with limited credit history. Improving the depth of capital markets would support a more diverse range of funding options and promote competition between lenders, thus improving access to finance for new firm entrants and intangible investments. In Europe, making further progress on implementing the Savings and Investments Union will be important in this regard. Reforms that improve access to credit are also relevant in emerging-market economies including Brazil and India (Chapter 3). Developing certain segments of capital markets may require some public financial support and regulatory actions, provided they do not endanger financial stability. Possible examples include adjusting regulatory restrictions on the investment activities of pension providers, reducing administrative requirements on fintech lenders and equity crowdfunding platforms, reforms that enable “open finance”, and public investment in venture capital markets. The latter may be particularly well-suited to funding investments by innovative firms with non-standard risk profiles (Calvino, Criscuolo and Menon, 2015). Government involvement in venture capital deals has been particularly notable in Hungary but has also played a role in many other European economies (Figure 2.24). There can be synergies between promoting venture capital and efforts undertaken in some countries to develop specific public equity markets for smaller and innovative firms (for example, KOSDAQ in Korea, Mothers Exchange in Japan and SME growth markets in the European Union). These exchanges typically have simplified listing and disclosure requirements and can provide an appealing exit option for venture capital investors once successful firms expand (Carvajal and Dider, 2024). Further developing market-based finance could also ease access to finance in emerging\u0002market economies but would often benefit from complementary reforms that promote macro-financial stability and access to digital financial technologies (Banerjee, Mehrotra and Zampolli, 2024).  91 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Figure 2.24.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/y3opx8 The availability of workers with skills that match business needs can both encourage capital investment and maximise its productivity payoff. This can be aided by structural reforms that lower frictions in the labour market, such as reducing the prevalence of unnecessary non-compete clauses (Andrews and Garnero, 2025). Developing a workforce with skills that evolve with underlying structural changes in the economy can also be an important enabling factor for new capital investment, as skills demands are evolving rapidly with population ageing, the digital and green transitions (OECD, 2024a). More broadly, recent OECD estimates suggest that around one-sixth of the productivity slowdown in OECD countries since the mid-2000s can be accounted for by a weakening in human capital accumulation (Andrews et al., 2024). A key need is for effective government efforts to promote investment in lifelong learning. Policy reform priorities include ensuring strong foundational skills that form the basis for further learning, the availability of high-quality adult training programmes, and encouraging participation in education by adapting programs and qualification requirements, including for those currently in the workforce. High-quality public investment is needed in priority areas Public capital spending can play a key role in supporting aggregate investment, especially when economies are operating at less than full capacity. Where fiscal space allows, public investment can provide an immediate boost to economic activity by stimulating demand and employment, particularly in sectors with strong multiplier effects (Mourougane et al., 2016). In the longer term, high-quality public investment can crowd-in private investment, foster innovation, and raise human capital (Box 2.2), thereby boosting potential output growth. However, public investment can also crowd out private spending—especially in contexts where it increases borrowing costs for firms, either by heightening concerns over debt sustainability, or if it substitutes private investment rather than complements it. Anchoring public investment within a credible medium-term budgetary framework can enhance policy predictability, support prioritisation and sequencing, and strengthen fiscal sustainability (OECD, 2019). Robust public investment management frameworks are essential to ensure the efficiency of public capital spending and its complementarity with private investment. Close coordination with subnational governments is often required, particularly for infrastructure projects with regional development objectives. 92  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Box 2.2. Government investment and growth-enhancing structural outcomes What is the role of public investment in building human capital and fostering innovation? As governments aim to strengthen long-term growth and resilience – particularly in a context of constrained fiscal space – it is crucial that public spending is effectively targeted to areas that yield the greatest returns. This box examines the growth-enhancing effects of government investment in three key areas: research and development (R&D), education, and health. OECD work has long highlighted the importance of investment in these areas for raising potential output growth (Fournier and Johansson, 2016). Public R&D contributes to the economy’s knowledge base and can catalyse private sector innovation. Investment in education strengthens human capital by improving workforce skills, while spending on health supports a productive workforce.1 Figure 2.25. Government investment can have clear benefits for long-term growth Note: Cumulative impulse responses of a shock to government investment on a productivity channel. The dependent variable is in log differences, multiplied by 100, hence the impulse response functions can be interpreted as cumulative growth rates.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/9snv6t To quantify the effects of government investment on key growth channels, a framework developed in recent literature on public debt is applied.2 Historical ‘spending surges’ – defined as increases of at least 10% and lasting three years or more – are identified in a panel of OECD countries from 1970 to 2019. This surge-based approach mitigates measurement challenges in fiscal data and improves identification by focusing on large, discrete shifts in spending more likely to be related to policy decisions. The dynamic effects of these surges on structural outcome variables closely linked to long-run growth are estimated using the local projection method (Jordà, 2005). The results suggest that spending surges are associated with meaningful improvements in growth-related outcomes. A sustained increase in government R&D spending increases private R&D expenditure by approximately 6% on average, 5 years after the shock (Figure 2.25). Surges in education spending are associated with a 2½ per cent rise in educational attainment, while increases in health spending reduce infant mortality by 2½ per cent.3 These effects tend to emerge gradually, underscoring the long-term nature of returns to public investment in these areas. ___________ 1. A broad definition of investment is used—covering physical capital and current spending—to reflect that operational expenditures (e.g. salaries of scientists, teachers, and doctors, as well as lab, classroom, and hospital resources) directly contribute to innovation and human capital formation. 2. Based on the forthcoming OECD Working Paper: ‘Government Spending and Growth Enhancing Structural Outcomes.’ 3. Infant mortality is used in the regressions since it is less subject to influence from confounding factors, but it is strongly correlated with other measures of mortality and life expectancy.  93 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Public investment can help enable the green and digital transitions, potentially crowding-in private investment. There remain significant investment needs in response to climate change. Global financing needs for climate mitigation are estimated at USD 5 trillion a year until 2030 (IMF, 2023). Investment needs for adaptation are also estimated to be large, though lower than for mitigation. Country-specific policy recommendations for increased climate-related public investment are highlighted in Chapter 3 for many advanced economies, as well as Malaysia. To complement public spending, other policy instruments – including pricing of climate-related externalities, information provision and regulations – can help more closely align private incentives with social benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation activities. Targeted public investment in basic research, through grants or publicly conducted R&D, can also catalyse private innovation in fields such as clean energy and climate technologies. Similarly, public investment can help support and encourage private investment in digital infrastructure. Efficient, reliable, and widely accessible digital infrastructure is essential to unlocking the full economic benefits of digitalisation, and public investment is often needed to extend coverage to rural areas or finance costly infrastructure projects with high positive externalities. Tax policy reforms can promote stronger private investment growth Tax policy settings also influence the conditions for private investment. While the recent decline in the user cost of capital has not been accompanied by strong aggregate investment growth in many economies, certain tax policy changes may be effective in incentivising investment spending. Low corporate tax rates on a broad corporate tax base can support investment by limiting the complexity of the tax system for businesses and distortions between different kinds of taxpayers. However, targeted measures such as relatively generous capital allowances or reduced non-profit taxes may be a more cost-effective way to support investment spending than general reductions in the statutory corporate tax rate (Box 2.3). Carefully designed tax incentives can also help address market failures in areas such as R&D spending and clean technology adoption (González Cabral et al., 2023; Dressler and Warwick, 2025). Temporary tax breaks, such as a short-lived acceleration in depreciation deductions, can also have powerful effects by advancing capital spending (Eichfelder and Scheider, 2014). However, such measures can be associated with deadweight costs and lower spending after the tax measure expires. In general, tax incentives may also be less effective in raising investment among firms with minimal profits (for example, small firms and start\u0002ups), where these incentives do not have provisions, such as allowing firms to carry-forward tax benefits, or tax credits to be refunded for firms without a tax liability. Tax measures that favour the accumulation of debt over equity can have negative consequences for financial stability by incentivising excessive debt accumulation and can have adverse implications for investment activity (Égert, 2021; Blundell-Wignall and Roulet, 2013). Incentives to favour debt financing may also inhibit the funding of intangible investments given that the underlying characteristics of these assets (uncertain returns, non-rivalry and low redeploy ability; Demmou and Franco, 2021) pose challenges in providing them as collateral against loans. However, this effect may be offset somewhat in tax systems that allow expensing of intangible investments. 94  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Box 2.3. Corporate income taxation and investment: impact and policy design considerations Corporate income taxation (CIT) is usually considered to be a key policy instrument for influencing business investment decisions. Since the seminal work of Hall and Jorgenson (1967), a large body of empirical research has found a negative relationship between CIT rates and investment (see e.g. Feld and Heckemeyer, 2011; Vartia, 2008; Schwellnus and Arnold 2008; Zwick and Mahon, 2017). Higher CIT rates reduce the after-tax returns on investment, thereby reducing the number of economically viable investment projects. Higher CIT rates also can negatively affect firms' cash flow, which reduces liquidity and can limit investment for firms facing financial constraints. The overall effect of CIT on investment also depends on the design of the CIT system beyond headline rates, including depreciation rules, tax allowances (such as accelerated depreciation), tax credits, CIT exemptions and reduced tax rates. Forward-looking effective tax rates, calculated based on hypothetical investment projects, can help gauge the impact of different design features of the tax system over the lifetime of an investment (Devereux and Griffith, 2003; Hanappi, 2018; González Cabral, Appelt and Hanappi, 2021; Celani, Dressler and Hanappi, 2022). The effective average tax rate (EATR) measures the average tax rate on investment projects earning positive profits or economic rents, while the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) reflects the tax burden on a marginal investment project that just breaks even. Figure 2.26 also shows that these rates vary across sources of finance (and they can also vary according to asset classes, project profitability and firm size), highlighting the distortions in many CIT systems. Figure 2.26. Effective corporate income tax rates vary strongly across assets and source of finance Distribution of statutory versus effective CIT rates across OECD countries, percentage of taxable income, 2023 Note: The distribution (minimum, maximum, median and interquartile range) of CIT rates across OECD countries. It compares statutory tax rates with synthetic tax policy indicators calculated on the basis of a prospective, hypothetical investment project. Unlike backward-looking effective tax rates, they do not incorporate any information about firms' actual tax payments. Further details of the model and assumptions are contained in OECD Corporate Tax Statistics and Hanappi (2018). Source: OECD Corporate Tax Statistics 2024 (OECD, 2024c). StatLink 2https://stat.link/75qr38 The impact of corporate taxation on investment: heterogeneity across firms and tax design Recent research suggests that the potential for corporate tax policy to support business investment varies across firms. Large, profitable multinationals — especially those with significant intangible assets, market power or profit-shifting opportunities — have become less sensitive to corporate tax changes in a single country over time, particularly since the global financial crisis (Hanappi and Whyman, 2023; Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023; Zwick and Mahon, 2017). Since a small number of large multinational firms account for a substantial share of total investment, this may reduce the aggregate investment response to tax policy changes.  95 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Moreover, evidence suggests that investment responses vary significantly depending on tax policy design. Increases in effective taxation through non-profit taxes (i.e. business taxes levied on bases other than corporate income, such as real estate or wealth) tend to have a stronger negative effect on investment than CIT. Reforms that affect the tax base, such as expanding capital allowances, can be more effective in supporting investment compared to statutory tax rate (STR) cuts (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). Studies indeed show increased investment in response to the provision of accelerated depreciation, immediate expensing, enhanced allowances and tax credits (Maffini, Xing and Devereux, 2019; Chodorow-Reich et al., 2024; Ohrn, 2019). However, care should be taken when using these allowances, as a CIT base that is too narrow can undermine revenue and introduce distortions. Reducing the debt bias in the CIT system can also reduce economic distortions and support financial stability (De Mooij and Hebous, 2018; Feld, Heckemeyer and Overesch, 2013). Alongside tax design, tax certainty is an essential condition for fostering business investment. Stable and predictable tax rules, combined with clear dispute resolution mechanisms, can reduce investment risk and support economic growth. In an increasingly globalised tax environment, both national policy choices and international cooperation can play a critical role in ensuring certainty. Enhancing the investment impact of CIT policy: potential options for reform Careful CIT design can enhance investment outcomes. Reforms could include: • Eliminating or reducing non-profit taxes, which tend to distort investment more than profit-based taxes. • Prioritise the use of more generous capital allowances and other tax-base measures, which often lead to stronger investment responses. • Limit tax incentives to areas with clear policy goals and strong governance arrangements, and where clear positive externalities warrant an incentive, such as for R&D or green investments. • Focus on expenditure-based tax incentives over income-based incentives. Support tax certainty through clear and predictable tax rules, clear eligibility criteria for tax incentives, and collaborative and consistent approach to tax administration, including internationally (OECD, 2024d).

An investment accelerator model To help assess the extent to which cyclical fluctuations have contributed to the observed dynamics in business investment since the global financial crisis (GFC) and the pandemic, a reduced-form investment model is estimated. This relates real business investment growth to its own lag as well as to current real output growth. The model is estimated for the 17 OECD countries for which data on real business investment are available. This empirical framework aims to capture the short-term response of investment to output fluctuations, shedding light on the role of demand-side factors in shaping investment patterns over recent cycles. The results are presented in Table 2.A.1. Annex Table 2.A.1.

The model is estimated on quarterly data from 1980Q1 to 2008Q2 for 17 OECD countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States). Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations. An extended model is subsequently estimated that incorporates the standard determinants of investment implied by neo-classical frameworks, while also allowing for the role of time-varying capital depreciation rates, real equity prices (which may reflect corporate balance sheet conditions and elements of Tobin’s Q), and capacity utilisation, proxied by the output gap (with a prior that a more negative output gap reduces the need to undertake new investment). The model is estimated using an unbalanced panel comprising 13 OECD economies, with quarterly data from 1993Q1 to 2022Q3, subject to data availability. All variables enter the model in logarithmic form, except for the output gap. In line with Pelgrin et al. (2002), the user cost of capital is introduced as log(1+UCC). Country-specific effects are controlled for using a least squares dummy variable estimator.

Developments in individual OECD and selected non-member economies 104  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Argentina GDP growth is projected to be robust, at 5.2% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. Private consumption and investment will continue to recover, sustained by higher real disposable incomes, more favourable financing conditions and an improving business environment. The recent removal of capital restrictions will support further improvements in economic sentiment and investment. Inflation will continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace. Amid rising imports, the current account will deteriorate. Monetary policy will need to remain tight to maintain inflation on a firmly downward path. Fiscal policy should build on the recent successful adjustment with more sustainable consolidation measures, to maintain strong fiscal outcomes. This includes phasing out subsidies, and raising public-sector efficiency, while replacing distortionary taxes by broader income and consumption tax bases. Recent efforts to reduce the regulatory burden will boost productivity and should continue, complemented by stronger incentives for the formalisation of workers and firms. A strong economic recovery is underway After a strong contraction in the first half of 2024, activity bounced back to growth of more than 18% in annualised terms in the third quarter and over 5% in the last quarter of 2024. The recovery was driven by private investment, consumption, and exports. Short-term indicators point towards further improvement. Credit to the private sector is recovering. Consumer confidence and business sentiment have improved. Annual inflation has fallen from 211% at the end of 2023 to 47% in April 2025. Unemployment was 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, down from a peak of 7.7% in early 2024. Real wages have already surpassed their October 2023 level. Argentina 1.

New gas production is helping to reduce energy import dependence, and the sector now generates trade surpluses. Exports to the United States account for only about 9% of Argentina’s total exports, or around 1% of GDP, and have not been significantly affected by US tariff increases so far. Argentina’s own import tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers have been reduced in 2024 and further reductions are expected in 2025. Macroeconomic policies have become more restrictive An impressive fiscal adjustment has been achieved, resulting in a headline fiscal surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2024. The government remains committed to achieving a positive primary balance in 2025, consistent with a balanced headline budget. Monetary policy has also helped the ongoing stabilisation by putting an end to excess money creation. The real benchmark interest rate has become positive and is expected to remain so. A new exchange rate regime has been announced, with the exchange rate floating within bands that will widen by 1% per month. A recent agreement with the IMF will provide additional funding and help to rebuild currency reserves. The removal of currency restrictions has improved confidence and investment incentives. The economy is set for a robust recovery, but important challenges still lie ahead The economic recovery is expected to continue, with GDP growth of 5.2% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, driven by higher private consumption and investment. Private investment will gain further momentum as currency and capital controls have been lifted. Real wages will continue improving as inflation declines, supporting private consumption. Export growth will slow compared to 2024. Exports have been affected by the recent real appreciation of the currency. Imports will continue their strong recovery, sustained by higher purchasing power and lower import barriers. Headline inflation is projected to slowly continue its downward path, falling to 37% in 2025 and 15% in 2026, sustained by lower import costs, balanced public accounts and positive real interest rates. Higher international interest rates could make it more difficult to accumulate international reserves. Higher US tariffs could result in lower export growth, but export prospects in the agricultural and livestock sector could potentially benefit from changing trade patterns. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Argentina Current prices ARS billion GDP at market prices 46 219.1 5.3 -1.6 -1.7 5.2 4.3 Private consumption 29 096.4 9.4 1.0 -4.2 6.2 3.8 Government consumption 7 356.1 3.0 1.5 -3.2 1.6 0.6 Gross fixed capital formation 7 991.6 11.2 -2.0 -17.4 21.7 14.9 Final domestic demand 44 444.1 8.6 0.6 -6.6 7.9 5.2 Stockbuilding¹ 363.1 -0.4 -0.1 -1.9 -0.4 0.0 Total domestic demand 44 807.2 8.3 0.4 -8.5 8.4 6.7 Exports of goods and services 8 350.3 4.6 -7.5 23.2 11.2 6.4 Imports of goods and services 6 938.4 17.8 1.7 -10.6 23.9 14.5 Net exports¹ 1 411.9 -1.8 -1.5 4.4 -1.3 -1.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 69.9 135.4 207.9 51.7 32.7 Consumer price index² _ 72.4 133.5 219.9 36.6 14.9 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -0.5 -3.0 0.9 0.0 -0.8 Percentage changes, volume (2004 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Expanding the personal income tax base could raise revenues in a progressive way and would allow distortionary and inefficient taxes that hinder investment to be reduced. Eliminating VAT exemptions could generate additional revenues. Despite recent progress, trade barriers remain high and lower import barriers on intermediate and capital goods could boost investment and export competitiveness. Regulatory processes have been simplified, but entry barriers in services sectors could be reduced further.  107 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Australia After a period of weak activity, GDP growth will reach 1.8% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. The strong recent immigration-driven growth in employment and the labour force will subside, leaving unemployment little changed at low levels. Inflation will remain close to target, averaging 2.3% in both 2025 and 2026. Australia has limited direct exposure to US tariff changes but is at risk from any marked slowdown in China, especially via its effect on commodity prices. Monetary policy tightening in 2022-24 squeezed disposable incomes and restrained demand, facilitating a return of inflation to target. The easing that began recently should continue in the coming quarters as long as inflation remains subdued. The main fiscal priorities relate to the longer term, addressing demographic and climate challenges and improving the efficiency of the tax system. A range of policy actions, including easing zoning restrictions, is needed to strengthen competition and productivity, as well as to raise housing investment to reverse the long-standing decline in housing affordability. Public consumption has helped to avoid a hard landing but global trade tensions are hitting sentiment The growth of private domestic demand – especially consumption and housing investment – was weak in 2024, in part reflecting the cumulative effect of the rise in interest rates since 2022. This weakness was, however, largely offset by strong growth in government consumption. Activity indicators for early 2025, including household spending, suggest that the improved but still moderate private consumption growth seen in late 2024 has continued. Both business and consumer sentiment have worsened recently, however, likely reflecting the elevated uncertainty arising from global trade tensions. The disinflation that began in late 2022 has continued, with headline inflation at or below the mid-point of the target range since September 2024, although the central bank’s preferred measure of core inflation remains above target. Disinflation has been achieved with little deterioration in labour market conditions, with employment continuing to grow strongly – driven by high net immigration over the past three years – and unemployment remaining low. The strength of employment was facilitated by subdued wage growth, while vacancies have fallen back to their pre-pandemic trend path. Sluggish external demand for Australia’s main export commodities yielded lower export prices and near\u0002stagnant volumes over the past year. The resulting fall in export receipts contrasted with a 5% increase in imports, pushing the current account deficit up to 1.9% of GDP in 2024. Australia’s exposure to US tariff increases is limited given that exports to the United States represent only about 5% of total exports. The impact of global trade tensions on the Australian economy is more likely to come via the depressing effect of higher tariffs and policy uncertainty on investment worldwide, manifested in part by lower prices for iron ore, coal and natural gas. 108  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Australia 1.

Federal and state budgets for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 fiscal years imply a widening of the general government deficit by 1.3 percentage points of GDP in calendar year 2025, after an increase of 1.9 percentage points in 2024, before the deficit stabilises at just under 4% of GDP in 2026. This would mean an upward drift in the ratio of public debt to GDP, but net debt to GDP would remain modest, reaching only 6.6% in 2026. Growth should be close to potential in 2025-26 barring adverse external shocks Given renewed, if modest, real wage growth and a recovery in real disposable household income as interest rates decline, private consumption growth is expected to pick up this year and next, more than offsetting a slowdown in public consumption growth. Some interest-rate-sensitive investment, such as housing, is expected to rebound in 2025, but other investment will be hindered by elevated global policy uncertainty, leaving overall fixed investment growth little changed from 2024. Final domestic demand growth in 2025 is projected to be around 2%, as in 2024, but with export and import volume growth projected to be similar in 2025, the drag on GDP from net exports seen in 2024 eases, allowing GDP growth to pick up from 1.1% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025. A further improvement in private consumption and investment in 2026 is projected to push GDP growth up to 2.2% in 2026, roughly in line with potential. The main sources of risk to the projections are external, especially any negative developments relating to import demand in China, by far Australia’s largest export market and the largest consumer of the main Australian export commodities. Policies should be geared to maintaining macroeconomic balance while addressing structural weaknesses The expected continued easing of monetary policy is warranted barring shocks pushing inflation back up and/or causing expectations to become de-anchored, but the difficult external context may demand nimbleness on the central bank’s part. The widening of the fiscal deficit in 2024-25 and the further budgeted increase in 2025-26 are justifiable given the weakness of private demand, but governments should look to save any windfalls relative to current plans. Consolidation is needed over the medium term, given the fiscal pressures on the horizon, including population ageing and costs associated with the transition to net zero. Key structural policy priorities are to address the housing affordability crisis by boosting supply and to accelerate progress toward net zero carbon emissions, especially in transport and industry. The revitalisation of competition policy heralded by two agreements between federal and state governments signed in 2024 should also help to reverse the longstanding decline in trend productivity growth, including by boosting business investment via streamlined regulation at all levels of government. This should be complemented by other policies to strengthen investment, including improved incentives for housebuilding, especially for social housing, and public investment to improve electricity grid connections. 110  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Austria The economy is projected to begin recovering from a prolonged recession, with output declining by 0.3% in 2025, but growing modestly by 1% in 2026. A gradual pickup in household consumption and private investment, supported by lower interest rates and a resilient labour market, will help drive the recovery. Inflation is expected to decline towards 2% by end-2026. Progressive fiscal consolidation may constrain demand growth. A slowdown in activity in Europe or deepening of structural challenges may hold back the recovery, while more persistent wage increases could further impair competitiveness and sustain higher inflation. Fiscal plans should progressively reduce the budget deficit in the years ahead, bringing it below 3% of GDP. Leveraging EU funds would help cushion the impact of a restrictive fiscal policy stance while strengthening economic resilience through the structural adjustment of industries heavily affected by rising energy costs. Increasing labour force participation among women and older workers as planned, along with shifting taxation away from labour, would promote more inclusive growth and support the sustainability of the public finances. Plans to expand broadband should include easing regulations relating to infrastructure deployment alongside innovative policy instruments and incentives. The economy has continued to contract, albeit at a slower pace Economic activity rose by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, signalling a modest recovery after having declined for three consecutive quarters and, in particular, by 0.4% in 2024Q4. Output growth was primarily driven by industrial production (up 0.6%, q-o-q in real terms), services (up 0.8%) and exports (up 1.4%). Inflation rose to 3.3% in April from 3.1% in March.

Weak trade performance in recent years reflects sectoral challenges in key products, such as machinery and vehicles, processed goods, chemical products, and other manufactured goods. While direct exposure to increases in US tariffs on EU goods is modest, there are indirect effects through weaker demand in European markets as a whole, notably Germany. Gas and electricity connections to other European countries are being upgraded rapidly, which will improve energy security and may help to lower prices, including for energy-intensive sectors. Fiscal consolidation is planned In 2024, the budget deficit reached an unexpectedly high level of 4.7% of GDP, driven by higher-than\u0002expected wage increases and spending at sub-federal level, and breached the 3% of GDP threshold of the EU rules. The new government has introduced a seven-year budget consolidation plan. In the short run, spending cuts are scheduled to amount to approximately EUR 6.3 billion in 2025 (1.3% of GDP) and EUR 8.7 billion in 2026 (1.9% of GDP). The spending reductions are primarily targeted at reducing pensions, family support and environmental subsidies and implementing across-the-board cuts in all ministerial departments. The plans also incorporate targeted tax increases on banks, tobacco products, gambling, real estate transactions and foundations, but tax relief for SMEs, as well as incentives for additional performance and investments in social welfare and economic growth. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Austria Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices* 406.1 5.4 -0.9 -1.3 -0.3 1.0 Private consumption 201.3 5.2 -0.3 0.1 0.6 1.4 Government consumption 88.6 -0.5 1.2 1.6 1.4 1.0 Gross fixed capital formation 105.5 0.3 -3.1 -3.6 0.0 1.5 Final domestic demand 395.4 2.6 -0.7 -0.5 0.6 1.3 Stockbuilding¹ 6.6 1.3 -3.0 -1.0 0.3 0.0 Total domestic demand 402.0 3.9 -3.7 -1.5 1.0 1.4 Exports of goods and services 227.7 10.1 -0.5 -4.3 -0.9 2.0 Imports of goods and services 223.7 7.1 -4.5 -5.0 0.7 1.6 Net exports¹ 4.0 1.7 2.5 0.3 -0.9 0.3 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 4.8 6.6 3.0 2.5 2.2 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 8.6 7.7 2.9 3.0 1.9 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 5.1 7.3 3.9 2.9 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 4.7 5.1 5.2 5.2 5.2 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 8.8 8.7 11.7 12.3 12.9 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -3.4 -2.6 -4.7 -4.4 -4.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 85.1 87.0 90.1 93.0 94.9 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 78.3 78.4 81.8 84.7 86.6 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -0.9 1.3 2.4 1.8 1.5 Percentage changes, volume (2015 prices) * Based on seasonal and working-day adjusted quarterly data; may differ from official non-working-day adjusted annual data.

Household consumption is expected to rebound gradually as real wages continue rising following previous inflation adjustments. With falling interest rates, private investment should begin to recover in the second half of 2025, although at a subdued pace given uncertainty and structural challenges. Trade growth will be relatively modest given wider regional developments, but will be supported in 2026 by higher government spending in Germany. Inflation is expected to decline steadily over the remainder of 2025 and 2026. Risks to these projections are skewed to the downside. Heightened trade tensions affecting Germany and an extended crisis in the automotive and other industrial sectors could further undermine economic prospects. More persistent wage increases could further hamper competitiveness. The fiscal consolidation plan may exert a stronger-than-expected dampening effect on economic activity, potentially resulting in a prolonged period of sluggish growth. Fiscal consolidation is needed and structural reforms would help sustain the recovery The medium-term consolidation strategy aims to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually until 2031 but phasing it in more progressively in the initial two years would limit the near-term impact on economic growth. Sustaining the consolidation path will be challenging given that population aging is projected to add fiscal pressure of around 2% of GDP by 2030, on top of rising interest payments and climate and defence spending. Reforms aimed at reducing regulatory barriers such as cutting red tape and lowering entry barriers in targeted sectors, in particular, professional services, would boost competitiveness and business investment. Similarly, addressing regulatory bottlenecks in housing, by easing land-use regulations, could improve housing supply and stimulate construction investment. Accelerating public investment plans to expand communications networks and high-speed connectivity, and easing related regulatory constraints, would foster digitalization and support long-term economic growth. Policies to increase female labour market participation – such as the planned expansion in child and long-term care facilities – and measures to raise the effective retirement age would help mitigate the impact of a declining working-age population.  113 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Belgium Economic activity is projected to continue to expand at a modest pace, with GDP growth stable at 1.0% in 2025 and 2026. Household consumption remains the primary driver of economic activity but is expected to slow as real income growth moderates. Investment is set to decelerate following robust growth in 2023 and 2024, primarily due to heightened uncertainty surrounding international trade developments. Export growth continues to be subdued, reflecting weakening competitiveness and sluggish external demand. Disinflation is expected to continue, pushing inflation below 2% in 2026. The fiscal deficit remains substantial, and meaningful fiscal consolidation efforts will only resume in 2026, leaving Belgium unlikely to meet European Union fiscal targets for both 2025 and 2026. The existing tax structure disproportionately relies on labour taxes, negatively affecting employment. Implementing comprehensive tax reforms to broaden the tax base, reduce distortions, and address disincentives to work could significantly enhance potential economic growth. Additionally, reducing administrative burdens, particularly for small businesses, could further stimulate investment. Growth has moderated Private consumption strengthened during the second half of 2024, buoyed by robust real disposable income growth in preceding years, but slowed markedly at the beginning of 2025. Public consumption followed a similar pattern. Other growth drivers have been less dynamic. Private investment has been weak, constrained by sluggish exports and subdued residential construction, although both rebounded in early 2025, pushing quarterly GDP growth to 0.4% (non-annualised) in the first quarter of 2025. Export performance has been consistently poor, resulting in the current account returning to a deficit. Changes in US tariff policies and the uncertain international environment have led to sharp falls in business and investor confidence since the end of 2024. Although the labour market remained resilient into early 2025, employment growth slowed significantly compared to previous years. Disinflation trends have persisted, with core inflation easing to 2.3% in April 2025. Headline inflation also declined to just above 3%, down from over 5% in the summer of 2024, driven in part by base effects from earlier increases in tobacco and energy prices. 114  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Belgium 1.

While its direct bilateral trade exposure to the new US tariffs on EU goods is limited – with exports to the United States primarily exempt goods like pharmaceuticals and chemicals – its exports would suffer from an ensuing slowdown of its main European partners. Fiscal consolidation is slow Automatic indexation bolstered household purchasing power during the post-pandemic inflation surge but also exacerbated fiscal deficits and weakened competitiveness. The transition to a new government has contributed to further delays in advancing fiscal consolidation efforts. Despite an anticipated reduction in the structural primary deficit to 2.4% of potential GDP by 2026 (down from 3.2% in 2024), achieving the EU fiscal targets will likely remain unattainable. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate further in 2025 before slightly decreasing to 4.5% in 2026, the same level as in 2024. Rising uncertainty will weigh on growth prospects Economic growth is expected to remain below potential. The investment recovery will continue to face headwinds from elevated global trade uncertainty, although residential investment is expected to improve gradually from low levels. Wage growth moderation aimed at restoring competitiveness will result in slower private consumption growth. Export activity will remain weak due to softer external demand, keeping the current account broadly balanced. Consumer prices are expected to decelerate, with core inflation falling below 2% in both 2025 and 2026. Increased European defence expenditures, notably from Germany, may provide a modest boost to exports. Conversely, Belgium might face increased import penetration from China, a risk further aggravated by recent losses in competitiveness. Bold reforms are needed to address domestic challenges Effective fiscal consolidation should prioritise enhancing spending efficiency in healthcare and pension systems alongside comprehensive tax reform to shift taxation away from labour towards broader, less distortionary bases. A credible medium-term fiscal strategy featuring multiannual budgeting frameworks and binding expenditure rules at federal and regional levels is essential. Labour market policies should progressively phase out work disincentives and incentivise prolonged employment. Long-term economic growth would benefit significantly from regulatory simplification and expanded access to lifelong learning. Achieving climate objectives will require stronger incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments. Reducing administrative burdens on small and innovative businesses would further support investment and economic dynamism. 116  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Brazil Real GDP is projected to expand by 2.1% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. Household consumption will continue to be the principal driver of growth, even if slowing, bolstered by robust wage increases. Private investment experienced a marked pickup in 2024 and is expected to remain buoyant despite easing gradually. Export momentum is projected to improve modestly, albeit against a backdrop of significant exposure to demand from China. Inflation is projected to remain above the 3% target throughout both 2025 and 2026, driven predominantly by the services sector. Fiscal policy is expected to remain slightly expansionary in 2025. A proposed income tax reform, designed to be tax-neutral, is unlikely to generate additional fiscal space to accommodate rising spending pressures. Social expenditures are set to continue to rise, putting further pressure on the public finances. A tight monetary policy stance is projected to continue for some time. Lowering market entry and exit barriers, easing regulations, boosting infrastructure investments and fostering competition have significant potential to boost productivity and growth. Economic activity is slowing down Despite robust GDP growth of 3.4% in 2024, early signs of an economic slowdown emerged toward the end of the year. Domestic demand weakened, driven by a decline in household consumption coupled with lower investment, as heightened uncertainty, rising policy rates, and persistent inflation undermined both business and consumer confidence. Industrial production remains subdued, but after five consecutive months of stagnation, it grew by 1.2% in March. Retail sales have moderated after a 4.7% annual increase in 2024. Conversely, the services sector maintained its strong momentum in early 2025, propelled by the information and communications sector. In agriculture, the 2025 harvest is projected to be much stronger than in 2024, which was affected by a drought. Although unemployment edged up slightly to 6.8% in February from its historic low in November, the labour market remains resilient, as evidenced by record\u0002high formal-sector employment and earnings.

Core inflation also rose, and inflation expectations remain persistently above the target for 2025. Exports to the United States represent 12% of total exports, but less than 2% of GDP. Manufactured goods account for over 78% of shipments to the United States and are subject to the 10% additional tariff while steel, aluminium and auto parts are affected by a larger tariff increase to 25% and an elimination of quotas and exemptions.

This tightening is intended to address price pressures from a positive output gap, a tight labour market with robust wage growth, an ongoing fiscal expansion, and a depreciating currency, all of which are driving inflation expectations higher. Despite heightened policy uncertainty, the projections include further rate increases, bringing the policy rate to 15% towards the end of 2025, before a gradual reduction to 12% by the end of 2026 as inflationary pressures ease. Fiscal policy is expected to remain modestly expansionary, posing challenges for meeting the primary balance target. Under the current fiscal rule, the government is required to achieve a balanced primary budget in 2025 and a primary surplus of 0.25% of GDP in 2026. However, persistent spending pressures from social benefits and strict minimum spending requirements for healthcare and education, pose significant challenges for meeting these targets. Moreover, slower economic activity is likely to constrain government revenue growth. This financing gap may end up being bridged by one-off measures, such as increased dividend and royalty receipts, or by broad-based expenditure freezes. Additionally, interest payments, currently estimated at around 8% of GDP, will continue to follow rising interest rates, increasing the growth of gross public debt. Growth is set to ease Economic growth is projected to ease from 3.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025, and 1.6% in 2026. The moderation is largely driven by a slowdown in domestic demand. Household consumption is expected to soften as higher inflation and weaker consumer confidence take their toll. After a strong rebound in 2024, private investment will likely become weaker over 2025 and 2026 due to softening external demand and the impact of higher interest rates. On the supply side, the manufacturing sector faces challenges from rising tariffs in the United States, which remains the primary destination for Brazilian manufacturing exports. Annual inflation is forecast at 5.7% in 2025 before easing slightly to 5.0% in 2026. This reflects quarterly inflation gradually converging toward the target, reaching around 4% in the final quarter of 2026, although intermittent upticks from trade and tariff shocks remain possible. The projections are subject to several risks. Fiscal slippage could dampen investment and erode confidence. Inflation risks are slightly tilted to the upside as persistent financial market tensions and further currency depreciation could intensify price pressures. Moreover, any additional deterioration of confidence in the fiscal outlook would likely extend the current episode of unanchored inflation expectations and require higher interest rates for longer, further undermining the economic outlook. Consolidating public spending while expanding infrastructure investment Fiscal consolidation is essential to put public debt on a declining trajectory. Reforming automatic spending rules, particularly those concerning education and healthcare, would allow greater flexibility to address priority challenges, and adjusting the indexation formula for public pensions and social benefits would reduce the burden of these benefits on the public finances. Stringent regulations and high administrative burdens on goods and services markets hinder competition and hamper the entry of new firms, thus dampening productivity growth and investment. Although recent measures have trimmed unnecessary bureaucracy, further reductions in regulatory burdens and licensing requirements remain critical. Easing entry restrictions in professional services, including abolishing exclusive rights for certain ancillary tasks, could reduce the cost of doing business, thereby boosting competition and enhancing productivity. Moreover, enhanced access to foreign markets and deeper integration into global value chains can be achieved by lowering existing trade barriers. Public spending on infrastructure could become more effective by addressing shortcomings in planning and project execution, as more than 30% of public  119 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 infrastructure projects are interrupted either temporarily or permanently. Expanding technical assistance to subnational governments, which frequently face capacity constraints for infrastructure project preparation and procurement, would significantly enhance the planning and delivery of such investments. Finally, unlocking additional private financing sources is crucial for bridging infrastructure gaps in the medium term. A comprehensive reassessment of current risk-sharing mechanisms and a concerted effort to minimise policy risks and judicial uncertainty could improve the framework conditions for private infrastructure investments. 120  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Bulgaria GDP is expected to increase by 2.6% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026 driven by household consumption growth, supported by ongoing high income and credit growth, and higher government investment with the rollout of EU funds. Exports will grow slowly reflecting weaker growth in other EU economies. Headline inflation has been rising and wage pressures remain elevated. Sustained wage growth risks hindering the moderation of inflation. Interest rates have followed those in the euro area, under the currency board, but transmission to the Bulgarian economy is slow and incomplete, contributing to a household credit boom. Further macroprudential measures should be deployed. Bulgaria has requested an assessment of its readiness to join the euro area, which is assumed to occur in January 2026. The fiscal deficit is set to remain consistent with the 3% of GDP threshold. A more business-friendly administrative environment would help to boost investment, while more effective activation policies and measures to tackle informality would help to make better use of Bulgaria’s labour force. Growth has been driven by consumption GDP increased by 2.8% in 2024 with strong household consumption driven by wage increases, credit growth and higher government transfers. Both public and private investment have been weak due to political uncertainty and low absorption and delay of EU funds. Industrial activity fell below its pre-pandemic levels in the first three months of 2025 reflecting continued declines in mining and energy production. Manufacturing output continued its downward trend, though it remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Services and construction activity also remained above pre-pandemic levels. Overall, in the first quarter of 2025, GDP increased by 0.6% (non-annualised). Annual headline inflation increased to 3.5% in April 2025 from 2.4% in April 2024. Unemployment has been declining in tandem with the pick-up in economic activity. Bulgaria Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database.

Imports recovered more than expected in 2024, supported by domestic consumption, and outpaced exports, weighing on the current account balance. Recent changes in global trade policies and higher US tariffs on imports of goods from the EU will have a modest impact on trade, GDP growth and inflation, largely through spillover effects from weaker EU demand as direct trade linkages with the United States are weak. Interest rates will stay low, while the budget deficit will remain at 3% of GDP Interest rate developments will continue to broadly follow euro area monetary policy given the currency board regime. However, transmission of monetary policy to domestic deposit and lending rates has been slow and incomplete due to high liquidity and stiff competition in the banking sector, leading to lending rates that are below euro area norms and strong domestic credit growth. Bulgaria requested a convergence report assessing its readiness for euro adoption in January 2026. Fiscal policy is set to meet the 3% of GDP EU ceiling for the budget deficit. The government may need to make spending adjustments relative to the budget if efforts to boost VAT revenue collection fall short, given planned strong spending in public sector salaries, minimum wages, pensions and social benefits. GDP growth will remain relatively strong Growth is projected to remain strong at 2.6% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026.

Export growth will be more subdued due to challenges in key export markets, while imports will be strong, driven by consumption and investment growth, increasing the current account deficit. Inflation is set to increase to 3.8% in 2025, following strong readings at the beginning of 2025 due to higher food prices, excise and VAT rates as well as household utility prices. Higher minimum wages coupled with persistent labour shortages will keep wage pressures elevated. Strong wage growth due to minimum wage and pensions indexation mechanisms risks high and persistent inflation while lower revenue collection relative to budget expectations risks widening the budget deficit. More prudent fiscal policy and a business-friendly investment climate are needed A modest fiscal consolidation is warranted to help moderate domestic demand and price pressures, and manage long-term spending pressures from ageing, climate and security needs. Reforming the current minimum wage and pension indexation mechanisms to slow the pace of growth in labour costs and government spending would support price stability. A more business-friendly investment climate with lower cost of doing business and reducing perceptions of corruption would attract more capital, domestic and foreign. Bringing more people into the workforce, alongside improvements in labour quality, would strengthen investor confidence in the availability of skilled workers and the effective utilisation of their investment. Improving digital and road infrastructure would enhance the prospective return on investment.  123 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Canada GDP growth is projected to weaken from 1.5% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026 due to trade tensions with the United States. Exports and business investment are expected to decline in 2025, while deteriorating employment prospects are expected to weigh on household consumption. Headline inflation will rise slightly, as the impact of higher tariffs on consumer prices is partially offset by lower energy prices due to the removal of the fuel charge. Core inflation will increase for a period before falling back towards 2% next year. Uncertainty about tariff levels and the impact on the Canadian economy remains high. The Bank of Canada has reduced interest rates to 2.75%, with further modest cuts expected this year. However, inflationary pressures from higher tariffs will require a more cautious approach to lowering interest rates. Increased government spending, particularly on housing affordability and new social programmes, has recently worsened the general government balance, although it had previously been in surplus. A key policy priority remains the need to enhance Canada’s weak productivity performance by removing internal barriers to trade and labour mobility, and by strengthening investment and innovation. GDP growth was robust in early 2025, but the outlook has deteriorated Real GDP grew robustly by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2024. Private consumption benefited from the temporary reductions in the goods and services tax (GST) and harmonised sales tax (HST) on qualifying goods. Housing investment continued to recover, and business investment rebounded after a previous quarterly decline. Leading indicators show that economic momentum continued into early 2025, with GDP growing by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2025 according to the flash estimate. However, the outlook has worsened since then due to rising trade tensions with the United States. Business and consumer sentiment have deteriorated, and policy uncertainty has increased. The labour market showed renewed signs of weakening in April, with the unemployment rate rising to 6.9%. Consumer price inflation eased to 1.7% in April, down from 2.3% in March, driven by lower energy prices following the removal of the federal fuel charge and the decline in oil prices. Core inflation increased to 2.6% in April, after 2.4% in March. Since February 2025, trade tensions and increased tariffs on imports to the United States heavily weigh on Canada’s external perspectives, given the interlinkages of the two economies. The heightened uncertainty about tariff levels also burdens long-term spending and investment decisions. For Canada, the tariffs include a 25% tariff on goods and a 10% tariff on energy and potash for imports into the United States that do not fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The projections assume that about 50% of imports do not fall under the agreement. Additionally, they incorporate the 25% tariff rate on steel and aluminium products and the 25% tariff rate on non-US content in USMCA-compliant automobiles. They also account for the counter measures announced by the Canadian government. The broader rise in US tariffs will also dampen external demand. The increased volatility of financial conditions will also adversely impact the near-term outlook. 124  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Canada 1 Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and S&P Global.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/5obnjx Monetary policy has eased, and fiscal policy will be supportive in 2025 The Bank of Canada began to lower interest rates in June 2024, with a total decline of 225 basis points as of mid-April 2025, bringing the policy rate to 2.75%. The projection includes a further 50 basis point reduction in the rate during 2025. The central bank will need to carefully balance the opposing impacts on inflation from tariffs: upward pressure from higher import prices and downward pressure from lower demand. Quantitative tightening, i.e. net asset sales, ended in March. The transmission of lower policy rates to lending rates has progressed, and its impact on the real economy is expected to become more apparent in 2026, as other uncertainty factors wane. The general government budget balance has shifted from a small surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2023 to a deficit of 2.1% of GDP in 2024, driven by a one-off compensation payment of about 0.7% of GDP, higher interest payments and increased discretionary spending, particularly on new social programmes and affordable housing. The headline deficit is set to improve in 2025, while the underlying primary balance will slightly weaken. The removal of the federal fuel charge on April 1 will have a broadly neutral budgetary impact, as its revenues were principally recycled back to households and businesses through the \"Canada Carbon Rebate”. For 2026, a further improvement in the headline balance is assumed, helped by mild fiscal tightening. GDP growth is expected to slow due to trade tensions After still robust GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025, GDP growth is expected to drop in the second quarter due to sharply falling exports to the United States due to higher tariffs. Household consumption and business investment will also be affected negatively by trade disruptions and high uncertainty. Housing investment is anticipated to remain broadly flat in the first half of 2025, weighed down by elevated uncertainty. Imports are expected to decline less than exports, resulting in a negative net export contribution to GDP growth in 2025. Labour market conditions will further deteriorate in 2025. In 2026, GDP is projected to slowly recover as the economy adjusts to the new tariff environment. Lower interest rates will support business investment and household consumption as uncertainty declines. However, 126  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 slower population growth will moderate aggregate consumption growth. Consumer price inflation is expected to be pushed upwards by higher tariffs, which will increase import prices. However, starting April 1, this will be partly counterbalanced by lower energy prices resulting from the removal of the federal fuel charge. Core inflation is anticipated to increase more sharply in 2025 before gradually declining in the course of 2026. Substantial risks remain, reflecting the highly uncertain situation. Externally, there are risks regarding additional tariffs on Canadian imports to the United States and the potential lifting of the USMCA exemption. Conversely, tariff reductions for Canada could improve economic prospects. US tariffs on other countries could rise or remain at their current levels after the current 90-day suspension period, affecting external demand. There is also significant uncertainty regarding how tariffs will pass through to the Canadian economy, given the magnitude of the tariffs and the strong interconnectedness of North American supply chains. Domestically, new reform measures by the incoming government present upside risks to GDP, while stronger-than-anticipated spillover effects from trade tensions to domestic financial conditions could pose downside risks. Reforms could strengthen productivity and internal markets Trade tensions have highlighted Canada's dependence on the US economy. While the United States remains an important trading partner, Canada should continue to diversify its export markets. Furthermore, Canada can enhance its productivity performance and strengthen internal markets. High regulatory barriers on interprovincial trade should be reduced by expanding the scope of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. A Canada-wide recognition of foreign credentials could improve labour mobility for immigrants. There is also room to strengthen innovation and competition. Existing R&D tax incentives should be streamlined for both smaller and larger companies and include more direct support. The competitive environment for digital and telecommunication businesses could be further strengthened. The government could also increase investment in infrastructure. Finally, the removal of the federal fuel charge will necessitate a reassessment of Canada’s carbon emissions reduction strategy.  127 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Chile Output is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025 and in 2026. Household consumption will benefit from rising real wages and job creation, while investment will be supported by reduced credit costs and improved business confidence. Export growth is projected to remain solid, despite ongoing global trade uncertainties. A broader expansion of global tariffs could affect Chile’s exports. Inflation is projected to gradually fall to 3.3% in 2026. Monetary policy is expected to gradually converge to a neutral stance as inflation stays on a declining path. Fiscal policy will remain prudent, guided by the fiscal rule, and focused on keeping debt sustainable while supporting targeted investment and social spending. Advancing structural reforms to simplify regulations, improve permit procedures, and boost skills and innovation will be essential to lift investment and productivity growth. Growth remains resilient despite global risks Activity has strengthened since mid-2024, with annual seasonally adjusted GDP growth reaching 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The March monthly economic indicator points to continued expansion and an upward revision in growth in early 2025, driven mainly by non-mining components. Industrial output is recovering, helped by solid external demand and recovering business sentiment. Headline inflation has edged up recently, to 4.5% in April, reflecting the adjustment of electricity tariffs after a multi-year freeze, to align prices more closely with actual generation and distribution costs, and higher energy costs. Core inflation, however, has continued its downward trend, falling steadily to 3.7% in April 2025. The impact of the rise in energy prices on inflation is expected to be temporary. Two-year ahead inflation expectations remain firmly anchored around the central bank’s 3% target. Real wages are rising again and employment is growing, although the pace of job creation remains uneven across sectors. Chile 1. Consumer price index excluding energy and food.

China’s improved outlook has sustained demand for Chilean commodities, reinforcing export revenues. Tourism inflows have recovered, benefiting retail and services. However, global uncertainty has intensified due to new tariff increases in the United States, Chile’s second-largest trading partner. The United States accounts for just 16% of Chilean exports of goods, with 45% of those shipments – including copper, other minerals, and wood products – currently exempt from US tariffs. Monetary policy will be broadly neutral alongside fiscal consolidation The monetary policy stance is expected to converge towards the estimated neutral rate of 4%, following a pause in the easing cycle, and the output gap is narrow. Gradual rate cuts are expected in 2025 by the central bank, with policy rates falling to 4¼ per cent in the latter half of 2026. On the fiscal side, policy is assumed to remain prudent in 2025 and 2026, in line with the government’s commitment to the fiscal rule. The government announced additional fiscal consolidation measures in the first quarter of 2025, totalling about 0.6% of GDP, mainly through administrative spending cuts. The primary balance is projected to improve gradually, with debt stabilising over the projection period. Revenue raising measures including a new mining royalty are set to support revenues and help finance key programmes over the projection period. Growth will hold up amid trade uncertainty GDP is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025 and 2026, supported by rising real incomes, recovering consumer sentiment and investment.

Rising trade tensions, particularly involving the US and China, are expected to weaken growth in key export markets. Headline inflation is set to converge to 3% by the end of 2026, reflecting waning supply shocks, anchored expectations and contained wage pressures. Core inflation will continue declining, helped by prudent monetary policy and a stable exchange rate. Volatile energy and commodity prices and weather-related disruptions may cause temporary inflation fluctuations. Risks to the outlook include a sharper slowdown in global demand for copper, potentially triggered by weaker activity in China. Global uncertainty, if prolonged, could weigh on sentiment and investment. On the upside, faster progress in large mining projects and stronger household real wage growth may boost domestic demand more than expected. While financial spillovers remain contained for now, increased global market volatility could tighten financing conditions. Streamlined regulation would improve the investment climate Ensuring macroeconomic stability and public debt sustainability requires balancing fiscal consolidation with efforts to boost long-term growth. In addition to prudent budget management, continued progress in reducing regulatory barriers and fostering competition is essential, including through simplified procedures that lower entry barriers for new firms across sectors. Advancing the permit reform, currently underway, will simplify, standardise and speed up the issuance of multiple sectoral permits to boost investment while maintaining environmental safeguards. Promoting green and resilient infrastructure requires significant investment while fostering innovation, particularly in clean technologies. 130  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 China Economic growth will slow to 4.7% in 2025 and weaken further in 2026 to 4.3%. Consumption is being dampened by still high precautionary savings as a scarring effect of the pandemic, and the real estate correction but will be supported by the continuing trade-in programme in 2025. Investment in the real estate sector will continue to contract, but business investment will be buttressed in 2025 by the trade-in programme for enterprises. Infrastructure investment will be stable. Exports will be curbed by the newly imposed tariffs on trade with the United States, while imports will fall due to continued localisation of production. Consumer price inflation will remain low, and producer prices will continue to fall. Fiscal policy will become more supportive with a sizeable stimulus approved to finance the trade-in programme and social transfers, unprecedented in recent decades. Some major state-owned banks will be recapitalised to enable them to expand lending. Monetary policy will provide liquidity as needed. Easing prudential measures surrounding mortgage lending will support housing demand. Liberalisation in several services, including healthcare and childcare, and reforms to wage setting mechanisms to support higher wages will boost efficiency and potentially consumption. The social security system should be revamped to reduce precautionary savings and support consumption in a sustainable manner. Administrative monopolies as well as illegal fees should be abolished to unleash private sector potential. Growth has been stable despite the trade conflict Annual growth was broadly stable at 5.4% in the first quarter of 2025. Consumption has been supported by the expansion of the trade-in programme, now including smartphones in addition to home electronics. Manufacturing investment has remained stable, supported by strong industrial production, and infrastructure growth has been strong. Investment in real estate, however, continues to fall, as excess supply needs to be worked off. Declining food prices have kept inflation below zero. The producer price index has continued to fall.

The tariffs will disproportionately affect private companies, including foreign ones, as they are the major exporters. While exports have been boosted by front-loading since late 2024, imports have fallen. China’s retaliatory tariffs will affect imports from the United States. New and existing external restrictions on trade in specific products and investment will further impede Chinese trade with the United States and contribute to risks of supply-chain disruption in the longer term.

The headline fiscal balance is the official balance defined as the difference between revenues and outlays. Revenues include: general budget revenue, revenue from the central stabilisation fund and sub-national budget adjustment. Outlays include: general budget spending, replenishment of the central stabilisation fund and repayment of principal on sub-national debt. 132  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Fiscal stimulus is being stepped up and monetary policy remains supportive Fiscal policy has become more supportive in 2025 with the official budget deficit (which is the deficit on the major budget account out of the four accounts) planned to increase by one percentage point of GDP this year, a move unseen in the recent decade. Spending on social policies and transfers will increase, including on public health services, subsidies for citizen health insurance, raising the minimum citizen pension, child subsidies and making childcare services available countrywide. These policies, alongside the extension and expansion of the trade-in programme to include smartphones in addition to home appliances, will mostly benefit low-income groups, who have a higher propensity to consume. In addition, liberalisation of health, elderly care, childcare and household services will support consumption. A new wage-setting mechanism will help raise annual wage growth. Use by local governments of special bonds will be more flexible, boosting infrastructure spending. The debt burden of heavily indebted local governments is being alleviated and some consumption taxes are being assigned to the local level, although the core imbalance between revenue assignments and spending responsibilities at sub-national government levels has yet to be addressed, and local governments continue to face financial pressure from lower real estate prices. Fiscal policy is assumed to be broadly neutral in 2026. Monetary policy rates will remain low, and the authorities are ready to lower them or the reserve requirement ratio further if needed. There was a 10 basis point cut in the loan prime rates, the seven-day reverse repo rate and the interest rates for the standing lending facility as well as a 50 basis point cut in the reserve requirement ratio in May. Banks have started a new round of deposit rate cuts. Special treasury bonds are being issued to recapitalise some of the major state-controlled banks so that they can step up their lending to support the private sector. Prudential easing measures adopted in late 2024 will continue to support housing demand, including for second-hand housing. Growth will be held back by higher trade barriers Growth is expected to slow in 2025 and weaken further in 2026 due to higher trade barriers and the continuing adjustment in the real estate sector. The higher level of tariffs on trade with the United States will contribute to lower exports and imports, with the impact in 2025 mitigated by the front-loading of trade. The impact on trade will further be mitigated by lower administrative burdens on firms, the full VAT refund on exports, the critical nature of some trade and through increased trade to other markets. However, it will be dampened by weaker demand in China’s export markets due to higher uncertainty. Consumption will be supported by higher incomes and increased social spending. Inflation will remain low, despite a small boost form higher import prices. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside. While an easing of trade restrictions between China and the United States would improve the outlook, any further increase of trade restrictions internationally or a slowdown in other economies would slow export growth and industrial activity. The small boost to social transfers cannot replace social security reforms and may keep uncertainty and precautionary savings high. Potential further credit events may disrupt the orderly adjustment process in the real estate sector. Excessive relaxation of demand-side restrictions in the property sector could result in stronger growth, but also in a further build-up of imbalances and sharper adjustment in the future. Delaying addressing the funding gap at sub-national government levels may lead to further accumulation of implicit debt and costly resolution later. Fiscal expansion coupled with more stringent measures to raise spending efficiency may lift the impact of the spending and result in higher growth. Excessive subsidies to import-dependent high\u0002technology sectors that face high tariffs and other restrictions could temporarily boost those industries but would waste scarce fiscal resources and potentially lead to excess capacity. Reducing the mortgage burden and targeting low-income groups with transfers may result in somewhat higher consumption.  133 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Structural reforms could hold up growth in the medium term While China’s potential growth is slowing due to population ageing, there is ample room for structural reforms to keep growth at a reasonably strong level in the medium term. At the current juncture, a range of measures are being explored to mitigate the impact of US tariffs: VAT refund on exports, tariff cuts on other countries and lowering the administrative burden on enterprises and abolishing illegal fees, as there is little room to cut profit margins due to cut-throat competition in many manufacturing industries. In services, where markups are much higher, strengthening the Fair Competition Review Mechanism and abolishing local protectionism should be pursued. New social transfers will boost consumption, but bolder social security reforms are needed. Unemployment insurance coverage needs to be extended to all, and pensions should provide at least a minimum standard of living to all eligible people. Furthermore, the list of treatments and medicines covered by health insurance needs to be widened so that health costs do not push people into poverty. 134  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Colombia Growth will recover to 2.5% this year and 2.6% in 2026. Investment will continue growing as it recovers from a historical fall and as financial conditions ease, though uncertainty and a weak housing market will keep it subdued. Consumption and exports will moderate due to US tariffs and a global economic slowdown. The decline in inflation, temporarily interrupted in early 2025, will resume but inflation will stay above the 3% target throughout 2026. Monetary policy should continue its data-dependent, prudent easing cycle to ensure durable disinflation towards target. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain high in 2025 and 2026, requiring additional fiscal consolidation to abide by fiscal rules, debt stabilisation, and a reduction of high debt servicing costs due to large risk premia. In the medium term, reducing budget rigidities and a comprehensive tax reform are needed to rebuild fiscal space. Easing administrative burdens and improving infrastructure would help revitalise productivity and investment growth. Growth sustains its momentum In 2024, growth averaged 1.6% year-on-year but picked up to 3.7% (saar) in the final quarter. This momentum was largely sustained in the first quarter of 2025. Investment continued to recover from its sharp fall in 2023 and remained a main driver of growth. Soft indicators give mixed messages, with business sentiment fluctuating around its slightly upward 12-month trend but consumer sentiment softening since February. The labour market remains strong, with unemployment at 9.1% in March. Inflation has hovered around 5.2% since November, although core inflation continued to fall. With a slower-than\u0002expected path of disinflation, inflation expectations for end-2025 have increased, from 3.9% in October to 4.8% in May. Colombia 1.

Colombia has maintained its tariffs from the bilateral free trade agreement with the United States. The peso depreciated strongly (around 5%) in April but largely recovered in May. Lower oil prices will suppress exports and budget revenues, increasing pressures on an already tight fiscal position. Fiscal deficits and monetary policy rates will remain higher for longer The fiscal position has deteriorated sharply in 2024, with a 6.8% headline deficit and a 2.4% primary deficit. Deficits are projected to stay high at 6% in 2025 and 5.6% in 2026 based on current spending plans and medium-term revenues estimates. The government assumes a short-term increase in tax revenue of 2.4% of GDP from unidentified measures. Unless there is evidence that tax collection significantly exceeds its current level, spending cuts of at least 0.9% of GDP are needed to comply with the fiscal rule in 2025. The central bank paused its monetary easing cycle in the first quarter when inflation stabilised but resumed it with a 25 basis points cut in April. With a continuation of the cautious, data-dependent easing cycle, the policy rate is projected to decline to 7% by the end of 2026. Growth will be moderate, but with increasing downside risks The economy will grow at moderate rates of 2.5% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026. Investment will continue its recovery from a fall to below 17% of GDP, but uncertainty and a housing market downturn will prevent a full return to the pre-pandemic investment rate of 21%. Uncertainty will similarly subdue private consumption in 2025. With growth close to potential, unemployment will stay around its current level.

Inflation will gradually slow to 4.5% year-on-year by late 2025 and 3.8% by the end of 2026. Strong remittances and reinvested profits will keep the current account deficit contained. Risks are tilted to the downside. Uncertainty has already put downward pressure on the exchange rate in recent weeks, which could intensify, adding to inflationary pressures. Larger fiscal deficits and a failure to comply with the fiscal rule would further increase risk premia and already high sovereign interest payments and dampen investor confidence. Fiscal discipline would help mitigate uncertainty Cuts to planned expenditure are required to intensify fiscal consolidation, comply with the fiscal rule, and ensure debt sustainability. Diesel subsidies could be removed, following earlier commendable measures for petrol, and social spending could be better targeted. Spending reviews could help identify further room for raising spending efficiency. A comprehensive tax reform, involving reductions in tax expenditures, a shift from corporate to personal income taxes, tackling tax evasion, and reducing budget rigidities, would also help increase fiscal space. Measures to restore investment and revitalise productivity growth include lowering administrative burdens on businesses, improving transport infrastructure, building subnational government capacities, and strengthening macroeconomic governance, transparency, and policy certainty.  137 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Costa Rica GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025 and 2026, after 4.3% in 2024. Domestic demand will drive growth, while external demand will deteriorate following the introduction of a 10% tariff on Costa Rican goods exports to the United States, its main trading partner. Private consumption will remain solid due to incremental increases in disposable income and employment creation. Inflation is gradually rising towards the 3% target and will reach 1.8% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, as the gradual improvement in domestic conditions leads to a slow increase in domestic inflationary pressures. The fiscal situation has improved but ensuring fiscal sustainability requires the strict implementation of the fiscal rule to contain public spending, along with spending reviews to improve public spending efficiency and expansion of tax bases. The monetary policy rate will remain stable as inflation is gradually approaching the target rate. Continuing to expand trade opportunities via trade agreements that open new markets would help diversify Costa Rica’s concentrated export markets. Growth remains solid amid low inflation Strong net exports and domestic demand boosted GDP growth in the second half of 2024. Household consumption was supported by robust credit consumption growth (8.8% year-on-year in November 2024) and the increase in real wages (5.6% year-on-year in March 2025) and employment (2.5% year-on-year in March 2024). Investment also benefited from strong FDI inflows growing by 14% over the year in December. Economic activity remains robust, with the Monthly Index of Economic Activity increasing by 3.6% (year-on-year) in March 2025, driven by both traditional (utilities, transport) and special regime sectors (manufacturing).

Services (tourism and business services) and semiconductors, a sizable part of Costa Rican exports to the United States, are excluded from the tariff. Perceived country risk, as measured by the Emerging Market Bond Index spread, averaged 2.1% in early May 2025, slightly above the 10-year historical low of around 2% in the first quarter of 2025. Monetary policy will maintain a neutral stance as fiscal policy remains prudent The monetary policy rate is expected to remain at 4% over the projection period, as inflation gradually increases towards the target rate of 3%, and in line with the neutral interest rate (estimated between 1% and 1.9%). The central government primary surplus is projected to remain positive (1.3% of GDP in both 2025 and 2026), as the fiscal rule constrains current expenditure growth. The central government budget deficit is projected to reach 3.3% of GDP in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, reflecting large public debt servicing costs of around 4.7% of GDP in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026. Public debt is expected to continue falling to 59.4% of GDP by end-2026. Trade tensions will slow growth GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025 and 2026. Export growth will weaken in 2025 due to the US tariff on merchandise imports from Costa Rica and is expected to remain subdued in 2026, reflecting moderate global demand and higher trade costs. Private investment will soften in 2025 as increased economic policy uncertainty will negatively affect foreign direct investment inflows and public investment remains muted due to a lack of fiscal space.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Increasing violence and criminality may impact negatively tourism and FDI inflows. The high degree of dollarisation of Costa Rica’s economy, with credit in dollars on the rise recently and two thirds of the dollarised debt unhedged, exposes the country to external funding and exchange rate risks, notably against the US dollar. Escalation of geopolitical or trade tensions might provoke trade disruptions and further reduce external demand. On the upside, renewed efforts to deepen trade integration might strengthen net exports. Persevering with reforms will help ensure fiscal sustainability and support investment The fiscal outlook has improved but the fiscal rule should continue to be strictly implemented to limit public spending and further reduce fiscal sustainability risks. Spending reviews should be introduced and tax bases expanded to increase public spending efficiency and create fiscal space. Continuing efforts to open new markets for exports via trade agreements would help export diversification. Eliminating restrictions and caps on private sector participation in electricity generation and retail supply and removing barriers to foreign investment in the electricity sector would help attract investment required for meeting the increasing demand in electricity. Reorientating vocational training towards highly demanded skills (digital and technical) and increasing the number of STEM graduates would support investment, create better jobs and enhance growth. 140  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Croatia GDP is projected to grow by 2.9% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026. Private consumption growth will moderate as real income growth slows. High uncertainty and moderation in the absorption of EU Structural and Recovery and Resilience Funds will weigh on investment growth. Export growth will be affected by the weakening of foreign demand due to rising trade restrictions. Risks are related to an escalation in trade tensions, mainly through weakening demand from key European trading partners. Fiscal prudence is needed to support disinflation and rebuild fiscal buffers to prepare for the challenges of population ageing, the green transition and higher defence spending. Efforts to enhance the regulatory framework and judicial efficacy are needed to support investment amid high uncertainty. Policies to upskill and reskill the workforce would help alleviate skill shortages and support productivity growth. Economic growth is moderating GDP growth was strong in the last quarter of 2024, but high frequency indicators point to a moderation in the beginning of 2025. Consumer confidence remains subdued, and retail sales growth has continued to slow in early 2025, partly reflecting consumer boycotts of supermarkets and retailers over high food prices in January and February. Harmonised headline consumer price and core inflation moderated to 3.9% and 4.2% in April, respectively, but remain high. The labour market has started to cool. The unemployment rate has remained constant since November, at a historical low of 4.6%, but vacancies have decreased. Nominal wage growth is declining but remains strong.

Export order books are subdued, suggesting weaker foreign demand and increasing uncertainty over international trade. Croatia’s direct trade exposure to the United States is limited, but the country will nevertheless be affected by the recently increased trade tariffs on EU goods through weaker external demand from key European partners. Growth in tourism continues to moderate due to high prices. Easier financial conditions in the euro area have passed through to borrowing costs, and bank lending to the private sector is strong. The fiscal stance will remain expansionary The government deficit increased substantially from 0.8% of GDP in 2023 to 2.4% of GDP in 2024. The fiscal stance is expected to remain expansionary in 2025. Public sector wages were further increased in 2025 and a new aid package worth EUR 296 million (0.4% of GDP) was approved in early 2025 to support households and small and medium-sized firms, including an extension of energy price caps until September 2025, one-off payments to pensioners and vulnerable groups, and support for farmers and students. Reduced VAT rates on energy were extended into 2025 and the list of food items subject to price caps was expanded amid high inflation. Mild fiscal consolidation is projected for 2026 as energy support and one-off measures are set to be phased out.

Investment will also slow amid high uncertainty, and some moderation of the absorption of EU Recovery and Resilience funds from high levels in recent years. Trade restrictions will weigh on exports mainly via weaker demand from European trading partners. Weakening demand will support a gradual decline in inflation, which will reach 2.4% by end-2026. Risks are tilted to the downside. Escalating trade tensions could further dampen demand from European trading partners. Expansionary fiscal policy and higher-than-expected wage growth may slow disinflation. Prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms are needed Support to households affected by high energy and food prices should be better targeted to avoid fiscal policy further fuelling inflation. Enhancing the regulatory framework, including by clarifying responsibilities across government levels in land-use planning, creating a one-stop shop for land rights procedures, and promoting out-of-court dispute resolution, would reduce uncertainty and encourage investment. Efforts to increase labour force participation by older and younger workers, and to attract foreign workers, combined with effective upskilling and reskilling reforms, would help alleviate skill shortages and support productivity growth.  143 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Czechia GDP growth is set to pick up from 1% in 2024 to 1.9% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. The ongoing recovery in households’ real disposable income will support robust consumer demand. High trade policy uncertainty and trade restrictions, especially in the automotive sector, are weighing on investment and exports. The fiscal expansion in Germany and stronger use of EU funds will support faster growth in 2026. Headline inflation is projected to fall back gradually to the 2% target. Risks are tilted to the downside, related to a further escalation of trade tensions that could lead to lower growth. Given high uncertainty, monetary policy needs to remain vigilant. If inflationary pressures subside durably, the central bank should further ease policy interest rates. A broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate in the short-term, while spending efficiency needs to be improved in the medium-term to accommodate higher spending for defence, an ageing population and the green transition. Further developing the capital market and streamlining regulations to facilitate the entry and scaling up of firms can boost investment and business dynamism. Household consumption is driving growth GDP growth continued to expand robustly in the first quarter of 2025, by 0.5% compared to the previous quarter, helped by a strong recovery in household consumption. High frequency indicators point to some moderation of growth in the near term. Retail sales growth remained solid in March but economic sentiment declined markedly in April. The manufacturing purchasing managers index continued to recover from a subdued level in April but export orders declined. Falling interest rates supported a pick-up in loan growth to the private sector in the first quarter of 2025. Consumer price inflation eased to 1.8% in April 2025 as food price inflation abated, but service price inflation remained elevated at close to 5%. The labour market remains tight, with employment growth concentrated in the services sector. Labour shortages are contributing to continued strong wage growth. Czechia 1. 3-month moving average.

While direct trade exposure to the United States is limited, with goods exports to the United States accounting for around 3% of total exports in 2024, the recent increase in US tariffs will affect the economy via European manufacturing supply chains, especially for automotive parts. The koruna exchange rate has been relatively stable vis-à-vis the euro since the beginning of 2025. Monetary policy is slightly restrictive and fiscal policy is neutral in 2025 The central bank lowered its policy rate from 7% to 3.5% between December 2023 and May 2025. Monetary policy is projected to remain slightly restrictive in 2025 and broadly neutral in 2026, with the policy rate declining to 3%. The fiscal position has improved significantly, with the budget deficit falling from 3.8% of GDP in 2023 to 2.2% of GDP in 2024, helped by the phasing out of energy support measures and the implementation of a consolidation package. In line with the fiscal-structural plan the projections assume a neutral fiscal stance in 2025 and a moderately restrictive stance in 2026. Growth is set to pick up but uncertainty is high Robust private consumption growth supported by gains in real disposable income will be the main driver of growth in 2025. High trade policy uncertainty will weigh on investment growth this year but a stronger drawing of EU funds will support a pick-up in 2026.

Stronger productivity growth will mitigate labour cost growth and help ease inflation, which should fall back to target in 2026. Risks are tilted to the downside. A further escalation of trade and geopolitical tensions could depress confidence and foreign demand and lead to a resurgence of supply chain disruptions. Managing uncertainty through prudent macroeconomic policy Monetary policy needs to remain vigilant given the high uncertainty about future trade policy and the effects on prices, exchange rates and demand. If inflationary pressures durably subside, the central bank should further ease monetary restrictiveness. In this environment, the neutral fiscal stance in 2025 is broadly appropriate and automatic stabilisers should be allowed to work freely if downside risks materialise. In the medium-term, spending efficiency needs to improve to accommodate spending pressures related to military spending, population ageing and the green transition. For example, building capacity to regularly conduct spending reviews can help identify saving potential without harming outcomes but requires better access to data. Recent reforms to improve the overall sustainability of the pension system should be fully implemented. Further developing the capital market and streamlining regulations to facilitate the entry and scaling up of firms can boost investment and business dynamism. 146  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Denmark After a rebound to 3.7% in 2024, GDP growth is projected to moderate to 3.0% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. Rising household real disposable income will sustain consumption and housing investment. Export growth will be supported by the pharmaceutical sector and the reopening of gas fields but will nevertheless slow amid softer foreign demand. Business investment will lose momentum due to high uncertainty about the global trade outlook. Inflation is projected to decline from 1.9% in 2025 to 1.7% in 2026 as capacity pressures ease and wage growth moderates. Risks are to the downside, as further trade restrictions could hit key export sectors. The central bank is projected to gradually lower policy rates, matching the expected easing of euro area rates. Fiscal policy is expected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026, while maintaining fiscal space to respond to potential adverse economic shocks. Sustained public support to innovation and knowledge diffusion is needed to safeguard investment and competitiveness and facilitate the green and digital transitions amid rising uncertainty and risks. GDP growth has become more balanced GDP contracted by 0.5% in the first quarter of the year, mostly due to a fall in volatile pharmaceutical exports. Output recovered in non-pharmaceutical sectors and investment in building and construction rebounded. Available indicators suggest a softening of manufacturing activity in early 2025, with low demand identified by firms as the main production constraint. Labour market tightness remains elevated relative to historical norms but has eased. While household purchasing power has improved as employment and real wages have continued to grow; falling consumer confidence has restrained consumption appetite. Housing, energy and food prices have moderated; and headline and core inflation have fallen to around 1.5%. Wage growth has remained aligned with collective agreements and recent negotiations suggest it should slow to around 3.5% per year. House prices have recovered and now exceed their 2022 peak amid lower interest rates. Denmark Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and Danmarks Statistik.

The impact of tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector is limited, as pharmaceutical exports are currently exempt from tariffs and there is substantial production in the United States. The slowdown in international trade flows will affect the maritime transport sector, already challenged by supply overcapacity. The outlook for the wind energy industry has been clouded by increasing investment costs and changes in US energy policy. Denmark is also dependent on prospects for demand in the euro area. Monetary and fiscal policies will be supportive The Danish central bank will follow anticipated rate cuts by the European Central Bank as part of the currency peg arrangement. Lower interest rates will support demand for credit. Stronger than expected labour market outcomes and exceptional revenues from corporate and pension taxes have led to another upward revision of the government balance in 2024. Rising spending on defence with the “Acceleration Fund” in 2025 and 2026 (0.8% of GDP) and personal income tax cuts (0.2% of GDP by 2026) will contribute to reducing the budget surplus. The fiscal impulse is projected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026, at over 2% of GDP, but additional spending on defence and falling tax revenues from firms operating abroad will have only a limited impact on the domestic economy. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Denmark Current prices DKK billion GDP at market prices 2 567.5 1.5 2.5 3.7 3.0 1.5 Private consumption 1 187.9 -2.1 1.4 0.9 1.1 1.6 Government consumption 613.5 -2.5 0.2 1.4 4.7 0.6 Gross fixed capital formation 578.3 2.8 -6.6 2.7 4.1 0.6 Final domestic demand 2 379.7 -1.0 -0.9 1.5 2.8 1.1 Stockbuilding¹ 27.7 0.6 -1.7 -1.0 0.1 0.1 Total domestic demand 2 407.4 -0.2 -2.7 0.7 3.1 1.2 Exports of goods and services 1 510.4 7.2 10.4 7.5 4.1 2.1 Imports of goods and services 1 350.2 4.4 3.7 3.0 4.0 1.8 Net exports¹ 160.1 1.9 5.1 3.3 0.5 0.4 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 9.1 -3.8 1.8 2.3 1.8 Consumer price index _ 7.7 3.3 1.4 1.9 1.7 Core inflation index² _ 4.0 4.3 1.4 1.5 1.7 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 4.5 5.2 6.3 6.8 6.8 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 3.5 3.0 2.1 2.8 2.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 3.4 3.3 4.5 2.4 1.8 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 40.1 39.8 36.7 34.0 32.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 34.1 33.6 31.1 28.4 26.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 11.7 9.8 13.0 12.5 12.2 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 1.

Exports will lose momentum due to slowing foreign demand, lowering the current account surplus. High uncertainty will weigh on business investment. Tensions on the labour market will ease and employment growth will stabilise. Private consumption will pick up gradually and housing investment will continue to recover, supported by real wage growth and tax reductions. After the rebound in early 2025 due to rising energy and food prices, headline inflation is expected to level off at 1.7% in 2026 in line with moderate labour cost growth and reduced capacity pressures. Economic prospects significantly rely on a few large firms, increasing the level of risks to the outlook. An introduction of tariffs on pharmaceuticals or transport services would further challenge key Danish firms. Stronger-than-expected growth in European main trading partners, following fiscal policy easing in Germany, could boost exports and help restore confidence. Policies should adapt to uncertain economic developments As fiscal space is large, with low public debt and a fiscal surplus, further fiscal policy easing could be envisaged if a further deterioration of the global trade outlook significantly hits the domestic economy. Efforts should concentrate on promoting productive investment for the green and digital transition. Reducing administrative burdens on firms, addressing skills shortages in strategic fields, including STEM, and streamlining processes to establish collaborations between businesses and universities would improve the business environment, stimulating investment and innovation capacities and maintaining high competitiveness. Clarifying government plans for the expansion of renewable energy and further accelerating network infrastructure developments would reduce uncertainty for investors in the energy sector.  149 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Estonia The economy will continue to recover with growth of 1.5% in 2025 and 2% in 2026, despite weaker external demand growth and ongoing tax increases. The recovery will be driven by consumption growth and higher public investment supported by EU funds. Inflation will pick up again in 2025 due to a VAT rise in July but moderate subsequently. Stronger spillovers from global trade developments and geopolitical tensions in the region pose downside risks. The slowing pace of tax increases is appropriate given unfolding global uncertainties, although medium-term fiscal pressures will need to be addressed. Investment in railway connections and electricity grid upgrades should be implemented without delay, as they can help boost the recovery and strengthen Estonia’s security. Increasing uptake of adult learning to drive the digital transition beyond ICT sector could help to improve competitiveness. Growth has resumed, despite headwinds The Estonian economy returned to growth in the middle of 2024, following two years of recession, with the upturn driven by trade and consumption. Although part of the growth in consumer spending was due to year-end car purchases in anticipation of a new vehicle tax this year, households have benefitted from a recovery in real incomes and lower interest rates. Preliminary estimates suggest GDP rose by 1.2% over the year to the first quarter of 2025, confirming the recovery despite growing headwinds. Inflation remained elevated at 4.4% in April, largely due to tax increases, higher prices for services and a pick-up in food prices. The unemployment rate remains high, while employment in manufacturing has started to increase. Business confidence indicators point to an improving outlook and consumer confidence has started to improve but remains subdued. Estonia 1. Excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco.

Trade growth has been sluggish due to the weakness in key export markets in the Nordic region, particularly in construction and manufacturing. Estonia’s direct exposure to trade with the United States is modest, although indirect linkages due to demand from the European market are more significant. The budget deficit has narrowed but will deteriorate again Falling interest rates will support the nascent recovery, but ongoing tax increases will weigh on household consumption. Last year, the budget deficit narrowed to 1.5% of GDP and will remain at a similar level this year. Increases in value added tax (VAT) and excise duties under way will weigh on consumption and temporarily raise headline inflation in the middle of the year. Next year, fiscal policy will ease significantly, and the budget deficit will deteriorate to 3% of GDP, with defence spending set to reach 5 % of GDP from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 and an increase in personal income tax allowance, despite further increases in the rates of personal and corporate income taxes.

It will be supported by monetary policy easing in the euro area and a pick-up in demand from the Nordic trading partners, as well as by public investment. Much of the defence expenditure increase will be spent on equipment purchases from abroad. Increased uncertainty stemming from both Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and global trade tensions will continue to keep business investment muted. Inflation will temporarily rise in the second half of the year because of tax increases but decline thereafter to 2.3% in 2026. The recovery could be derailed by a worsening of spillovers from global trade developments and geopolitical tensions in the region. More persistent inflationary pressures and wage demands are upside risks to inflation. Reforms are needed to ensure sustainable financing of new spending and enhance competitiveness Given high global uncertainties, the planned more gradual pace of tax increases seems appropriate. The distributional impact of the increased tax burden should be carefully assessed. Higher defence expenditures and spending pressures from an ageing population will eventually require new sources of revenue, which could come for instance from an annual tax on property. Ongoing expenditure reviews should continue. Public investment projects such as international railway connections and electricity grid upgrades can help strengthen Estonia’s security and should be implemented without delay. To advance the digital transition among businesses beyond the ICT sector and contribute to improving competitiveness, it will be important to increase the uptake of adult learning. 152  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Euro area GDP growth is projected to strengthen to 1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026 as foreign demand recovers. Private consumption will be supported by sustained growth of real disposable incomes. Private investment will be constrained by high uncertainty but will benefit from improved financing conditions; public investment will be supported by the Recovery and Resilience Facility funds. Wage growth is projected to ease gradually, helping core inflation to return to 2% by the second half of 2025. Fiscal policy will tighten in 2025 and remain broadly neutral in 2026, as countries make use of the national escape clauses under the new fiscal rules. Although defence spending is set to rise and debt financing could be required in the short term, prudent fiscal policy is needed to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy should remain prudent to ensure that inflation is durably reduced to target. Reducing regulatory burdens on labour mobility would help alleviate labour shortages, while progress on financial integration could boost cross-border financial flows, lifting private investment. The economy remains resilient amid increasing global uncertainty. The economy remains resilient amid high uncertainty GDP grew by 0.3% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2025. Recent indicators suggested some rebound in the economy, but the composite PMI declined in May, reflecting weakening in services and only modestly improving activity in manufacturing. Headline inflation stood at 2.2% in April, unchanged from March. Core inflation increased to 2.7% in April, from 2.4% in March, partly driven by the timing of Easter, but market and survey-based inflation expectations have remained broadly stable at the 2% target since December 2024. Services inflation also increased in April, to 4% in annual terms, up from 3.5% in March. The labour market is gradually normalising, with both employment growth and nominal wage growth slowing in the fourth quarter of 2024. At the same time, the euro area seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained low at 6.2% in March. Financial conditions continue to be mildly restrictive, with the corporate demand for loans decreasing, but a continuing rebound in housing loans and other lending to households. The number of bankruptcies fell slightly in the fourth quarter of 2024, from a high level in the first half of the year. Benign energy prices and increasing exports of chemicals and manufactured goods brought the goods trade surplus to EUR 44 billion or 0.3% of euro area GDP in March. Exports were affected by front-loading amid growing trade frictions and elevated geopolitical tensions. At the same time, the balance of services trade remained positive, and the current account surplus for the last 12 months increased to 2.9% of GDP in March. Energy commodity prices have decreased, but the recovery from the recent energy price shock has been uneven, with output and profits of energy-intensive firms decreasing. The US has introduced a 10% tariff on imports of EU goods, with a 25% tariff on imports of steel and aluminium and cars and car parts. The EU postponed its countermeasures for 90 days in April. In support of Ukraine, EU countries have extended temporary protection to more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees until March 2026, helping to reduce labour shortages in certain sectors. The EU has disbursed almost EUR 20 billion (0.1% of euro area GDP) from the EUR 50 billion Ukraine Facility and approved an additional loan of up to EUR 35 billion (0.2% of euro area GDP), financed by proceeds from frozen Russian assets.  153 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Euro area 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/maqz6b Macroeconomic policy is to become less restrictive The aggregate euro area fiscal stance is projected to tighten by about ¼% of GDP in 2025 and remain broadly unchanged in 2026. The fiscal measures to stem the effects of the energy crisis have been withdrawn, while spending under the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) programme could provide support of about 1% of GDP in 2025 and 2026. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has triggered additional military spending and the EU fiscal rules were relaxed by allowing the coordinated use of national escape clauses for up to 1.5% of GDP per year for defence purposes, enabling additional spending of about EUR 650 billion (4.3% of euro area GDP) over the next four years. In addition, the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) instrument will allow EU countries to borrow up to EUR 150 billion to facilitate the increase in defence spending. The European Central Bank’s monetary policy stance has become less restrictive, as the deposit facility rate has been cut by a cumulative 175 basis points since June 2024, to 2.25% in April 2025. The policy rate is projected to decrease further, reaching 1.75% in the latter part of 2025. While the interest rate cuts will support aggregate demand, the overall policy stance is projected to remain cautious for some time to durably reduce inflation to the 2% target. The short-term inflationary pressures stem from labour shortages and additional public expenditure under the NGEU programme, estimated to total 2.5% of GDP by end-2026. Economic growth will strengthen as domestic demand picks up Growth is projected to strengthen, supported by easing financial conditions and lower energy prices. The labour market will remain tight, with labour shortages in some occupations and historically low unemployment slowing down wage growth normalisation. Growing real disposable incomes will support consumption, albeit at a slowing rate as disinflation comes to an end. Elevated uncertainty related to trade tensions will weigh on private investment, but public investment will be supported by spending under the NGEU programme. Headline inflation is projected to moderate further, as labour cost pressures gradually dissipate. Core inflation is also projected to decline, returning to the level consistent with the ECB inflation target by mid-2026.  155 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Risks to the projections are tilted to the downside. Worsening trade tensions, such as an increase in US reciprocal tariffs and possible EU countermeasures, would weigh on external demand, while the tariffs already in place could trigger unfavourable trade diversion flows towards the euro area. Trade retaliation measures by the EU could add to inflationary pressures. Financial stability risks continue to exist in the euro area, with pockets of financial vulnerabilities in the commercial real estate and nonbanking financial sector. On the upside, a stronger use of accumulated household savings could strengthen private consumption. In addition, a durable reduction of geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions could hasten disinflation and help lift external demand. Structural reforms are needed to complement prudent macroeconomic policies The investment needs associated with defence, energy security and decarbonisation are considerable. While defence spending is set to rise, it should not be financed by debt issuance in the long term. Reprioritisation of fiscal spending and prudent fiscal policy will be needed to rebuild fiscal buffers and address other spending pressures, such as population ageing. Effective disbursement of the NGEU funds will help expand medium-term productive capacity but it is associated with short-term inflationary risks that need to be monitored at the EU level. The new EU fiscal rules encourage structural reforms and safeguards for medium-term fiscal sustainability, but the impending activation of the national escape clauses may further delay reduction of existing excessive deficits. To ensure a level playing field and effective use of public funds, state-aid rules should not be relaxed further. The monetary policy stance should not be eased prematurely and macroprudential instruments should be used to address potential financial sector vulnerabilities. Furthermore, labour shortages could be alleviated by attracting high-skilled non-EU workers and by reducing regulatory and administrative burdens on intra-EU mobility. Finally, progress on the Capital Markets Union and the banking union could help boost cross-border financial flows, lifting private investment. 156  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Finland The Finnish economy is set to grow by 0.7% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026 after contracting by 0.1% in 2024. Lower interest rates will support private consumption and investment, notwithstanding subdued confidence. Inflation is projected to remain modest, as lower energy prices and weak activity offset pressures from rising import costs. Imports should recover gradually, while export growth will be dampened by trade restrictions and lower global growth. Unemployment will remain elevated in 2025 before gradually declining. Russian hybrid warfare, including infrastructure sabotage and cyber-attacks, and escalating trade barriers continue to be key risks. Fiscal consolidation remains essential to place public debt on a downward path, amid rising pressures from population ageing and growing defence and security needs. Priorities include improving the efficiency of spending, particularly in health, and further normalising reduced VAT rates once the recovery is firmly underway. Boosting private R&D investment, expanding the pool of high-skilled workers through a more effective allocation of study places and better integration of foreign talent, as well as enhancing investment in renewable energy, will be key to strengthen innovation and investment and revive productivity. Weak confidence and high unemployment continue to weigh on the recovery Economic activity is gradually recovering. GDP grew in the first three quarters of 2024 but stalled in the fourth quarter, mainly due to sluggish private consumption and investment, before rising by an estimated 0.1% in the first quarter of 2025. Consumer and business confidence remain below long-term averages, particularly in construction. The unemployment rate stood at 9.5% in March, up from 8.4% a year earlier, reflecting continued weakness in construction and job losses in the public sector. Both headline and core inflation have picked up somewhat in 2025, although lower energy prices and subdued domestic demand are helping to contain underlying inflationary pressures. Wage growth moderated in 2024 after strong gains in 2023, but nominal earnings still outpaced inflation. House prices have stabilised after earlier declines, while falling interest rates are reducing household mortgage expenses. Finland 1. Real price index of old dwellings in housing companies.

Weak demand in key trading partners has dampened exports, while escalating trade restrictions, including the 10% US import tariffs on EU goods and increasing geoeconomic fractures have heightened uncertainty. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine continues to weigh on regional stability and the economic recovery. Russian hybrid warfare threats, including cyberattacks and infrastructure sabotage, have undermined business sentiment. The fiscal stance needs to tighten more Fiscal policy is set to tighten gradually in 2025, following an expansionary stance in 2024, with consolidation of a bit over ½ per cent of GDP. The fiscal deficit widened to 4.4% of GDP in 2024, driven by rising pension costs and spending pressures from health and defence, which were only partly offset by higher revenue from the increase in the standard VAT rate in September. Most wellbeing services counties, which assumed responsibility for social welfare and healthcare from municipalities in 2023, continue to record deficits despite efforts to reduce staffing. Ongoing consolidation, including spending cuts in social welfare programmes, is projected to reduce the deficit to 3.7% this year. The General Government Fiscal Plan for 2026–29 announced in April will slow the pace of consolidation. The plan includes cuts to personal and corporate income tax rates and a rise in defence spending, from 2.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3% by 2029, part of which will be implemented only after the 2026 projection horizon. Abstracting from the uncertain dynamic effects of tax cuts, these measures widen the fiscal gap by around 1.7% of GDP. With European Central Bank policy rates gradually declining, retail interest rates in Finland have been adjusting swiftly, given the high share of variable-rate mortgages, which will help drive a moderate recovery. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Finland Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 248.8 0.8 -0.9 -0.1 0.7 1.1 Private consumption 125.3 0.9 0.0 -0.1 0.0 1.7 Government consumption 61.7 -0.6 3.4 0.7 0.1 0.1 Gross fixed capital formation 60.7 1.5 -7.4 -7.1 -0.2 3.9 Final domestic demand 247.7 0.7 -1.0 -1.5 0.0 1.8 Stockbuilding¹ , ² 0.9 2.0 -3.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 248.6 2.8 -4.0 -0.8 0.0 1.7 Exports of goods and services 99.3 4.4 0.2 0.1 0.6 -0.7 Imports of goods and services 99.2 9.3 -6.7 -2.4 -0.2 0.9 Net exports¹ 0.1 -1.9 3.3 1.1 0.3 -0.7 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 3.5 1.4 1.6 1.9 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 7.2 4.3 1.0 1.8 1.9 Harmonised index of core inflation³ _ 3.6 4.1 2.2 2.5 2.0 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 6.8 7.3 8.4 9.1 8.7 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 1.5 2.0 2.8 4.1 4.3 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -0.2 -3.0 -4.4 -3.7 -3.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 81.4 85.6 90.4 93.7 96.3 General government debt, Maastricht definition⁴ (% of GDP) _ 74.0 77.5 82.1 85.4 88.0 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -2.4 -0.4 0.1 -0.2 -0.9 Percentage changes, volume (2015 prices) 3.

Lower interest rates, rising real wages and stabilising house prices are expected to support private consumption. Investment is also set to recover gradually, although heightened uncertainty, persistent weakness in construction and elevated unemployment may continue to weigh on domestic demand. Exports are projected to slow due to increasing trade restrictions and weak trading partner growth. Inflation is expected to remain moderate, at around 2% in 2025 and 2026, as rising import costs are partly offset by lower energy prices. The recovery is fragile and risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. A further escalation of global trade tensions could weaken export performance and delay investment. The persistent geopolitical rift with Russia may dampen confidence and foreign investment. On the upside, positive spillovers from stronger-than-expected investment in the green industrial transition or higher-than-anticipated large-scale defence and industrial orders, such as for steel and icebreakers, could lift growth above current projections. Facilitating investment and expanding the skilled workforce are key to boosting productivity Stepping up fiscal consolidation is key to reversing the rise in public debt and rebuilding fiscal buffers in the face of population ageing and growing security needs. Improving the efficiency of public spending, particularly in the health sector and wellbeing services counties, remains essential for achieving debt sustainability. Further normalising reduced VAT rates as the recovery gains traction would help broaden the tax base and raise revenue. Strengthening investment through government support, such as R&D tax credits, and improving regulatory predictability, especially in renewable energy, forestry and clean technologies, will spur Finland’s green industrial transition, where the country holds vast potential. Additionally, expanding the supply of high-skilled labour through better allocation of higher education places, faster completion rates, and more effective attraction and integration of foreign talent would also help boost innovation, investment and productivity.  159 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 France After growing below potential in 2023-24, at 1.1%, GDP growth is set to slow further to 0.6% in 2025 due to heightened economic policy uncertainty, before gradually recovering to 0.9% in 2026. Private consumption will become the main growth engine in 2025, as exports will suffer from increased trade tensions and investment will be held back by increased uncertainty. The recovery in 2026 is set to be supported by stronger investment and steady consumer spending. Inflation is expected to fall to 1.2% in 2025, driven by cuts in electricity tariffs, before edging up to 1.7% in 2026. The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow gradually to 5.4% and 5% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, from 5.8% of GDP in 2024. As the associated fiscal effort, of 1% of GDP in 2025, would be the largest in over a decade, there is a significant risk of fiscal slippages. Weaker-than-expected growth and rising defence spending would also make it harder to reach fiscal targets. Public debt is projected to remain high at nearly 120% of GDP in 2026. Stabilisation will require continued deficit reduction and growth-enhancing reforms. To unlock greater investment, structural reforms should prioritise digital uptake, simplifying regulations in the services sector and better targeting of innovation support towards innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. Activity has slowed amidst rising policy uncertainty Economic activity grew by 1.1% in 2024, reflecting a degree of resilience amid a challenging policy environment, heightened uncertainty after a government no-confidence vote, and a mild output fall in the fourth quarter that reduced the 2025 carry-over. GDP rebounded moderately in the first quarter of 2025, driven primarily by inventory accumulation, while private consumption stagnated and both investment and net exports both declined. However, business investment has stabilised since two quarters, after nearly five consecutive quarters of decline. Indicators remain gloomy though. Business confidence has remained below its long-term average since August 2024, while household confidence hit its lowest since the Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine began. The labour market has worsened, with employment falling by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Inflation decreased faster than expected at the end of 2024 and early 2025, reaching 0.9% year-on-year in April, helped by lower regulated tariffs on electricity in February. Core inflation continues to be higher than headline inflation. Business uncertainty has risen due to the lack of clarity around the tariffs imposed by the United States and potential retaliation by other major economies. France’s direct exposure to higher US tariffs on EU goods is relatively limited, with the US accounting for 5% of exports and 5.3% of imports of goods. However, France remains highly vulnerable to a broader slowdown in global demand, especially in Europe, which is the destination for 55% of its exports. 160  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 France 1 Source: www.policyuncertainty.com; and Banque de France.

Year-on-year growth rates. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. StatLink 2https://stat.link/spxefh Credit conditions will improve while fiscal policy will tighten The fiscal deficit is projected to have been 5.8% of GDP in 2024, slightly lower than earlier expectations. The government is targeting a reduction to 5.4% of GDP in 2025, requiring a 1% improvement in the structural primary balance, with additional measures beyond the current Budget. If fully implemented, this would be the strongest improvement since 2010. A consolidation effort in line with the government’s announcements is incorporated in the projections. Most of the consolidation will come from higher taxes, including exceptional taxes on high-income earners and large profitable firms, as well as on air travel and high-emitting vehicles. On the spending side, measures include a slowdown in municipal spending, cuts in central government spending, lower subsidies for low-wage workers, reductions in sick leave benefits and a tightening of unemployment benefits. No detailed consolidation plan has been set for 2026; an effort of 0.7% of GDP is assumed, though rising defence spending may hinder this. Since mid-2024, European Central Bank policy interest rate cuts have eased lending conditions, gradually supporting business and housing investment. However, private sector debt repayments remain high because of fixed-rate loans from the earlier high-interest period. The interest rate on new housing loans (excluding renegotiations) declined to 3.2% in March, the lowest level since May 2023, while new loan rates to businesses fell to 3.76%, 95 basis points lower than a year ago. The sovereign spread between France and Germany also narrowed to 68 basis points in May, almost 20 basis points below its December 2024 peak amid political turmoil. Nevertheless, it remains elevated relative to its long-term average, reflecting ongoing concerns over debt and economic policy uncertainty. High economic policy uncertainty will delay the rebound in growth Economic growth is expected to slow significantly in 2025, with the output gap widening throughout the next two years, driven by heightened uncertainty and rising trade tensions. The contribution of exports to growth will weaken. Private consumption will be supported by disinflation, transfers indexed on past inflation and a lower saving rate—though real income gains will be tempered by a slowing in wage catch- 162  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 up compared to 2024 and higher taxes on income. Unemployment is expected to rise with the slowdown in growth. The social assistance (RSA) reform requiring beneficiaries to register with public employment services and actively search for a job will add upward pressure on the unemployment rate while tighter low-wage subsidies may also reduce the employability of this group. Business investment will remain subdued over 2025 and will only gradually recover towards the end of the year, given weak trade prospects and policy uncertainty. Residential investment is expected to turn positive from mid-2025, following a progressive rise in building permits since the last quarter of 2024. Ahead of municipal elections, public investment is expected to rise in 2025, albeit at a slower pace. Inflation is expected to ease further in 2025, as economic activity slows and tariffs on US imports only have a limited impact due to France’s low exposure to the US market. The gap between headline and core inflation is expected to narrow as energy prices stabilise and services inflation eases. Risks are tilted to the downside. Higher tariffs on French exports and those of its key partners, especially in Europe, could weaken growth further. Retaliatory trade measures could push inflation higher. A softer stance on fiscal consolidation would support growth but push up the public debt ratio, raising bond yields and crowding out private investment. The risk of renewed policy turmoil later this year – due to the absence of a clear majority in the National Assembly – and the resulting uncertainty over fiscal policy may further constrain firms’ investment decisions. Stabilising debt and raising potential output call for broad-based reforms Sticking to fiscal consolidation plans is essential for France to stabilise and reduce public debt. While efforts so far have focused on tax increases, achieving medium-term fiscal targets will require a broader strategy, including spending cuts, shifting the tax structure toward less distortive taxes and implementing structural reforms to boost potential growth. Greater support for the labour market participation of older workers should focus on lifelong learning, especially investment in digital skills. Accelerating investment in digital technologies, especially among SMEs, requires boosting fibre adoption by clarifying tariffs and service offers, and by lowering installation costs. The innovation ecosystem is strong and dynamic but incentives for research and development should be more directed towards SMEs with high potential for breakthrough innovation. Further streamlining administrative procedures, easing regulatory barriers to market entry and simplifying regulations in key service sectors would stimulate competition and attract new capital.  163 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Germany The economy is projected to grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. Private consumption will increase due to low inflation, rising nominal wages and decreasing domestic policy uncertainty following the formation of a new government. High trade policy uncertainty will hamper investment in export-oriented manufacturing but, overall, private investment will pick up, supported by high corporate savings, declining interest rates and lower domestic policy uncertainty. Public investment in defence and infrastructure will rise strongly due to the increased flexibility in the fiscal rules and large investment needs. Rising US tariffs will weigh on foreign demand. Ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability requires improved public spending efficiency, reallocation of spending and broadening the tax base, while addressing rising spending pressures due to rapid population ageing. Continuing to reduce the administrative burden, digitalise the public administration and improve infrastructure implementation capacity, particularly at the municipal level, is needed to support the pick-up in public and private investment. To avoid rising inflationary pressures due to the significant demand shock from fiscal easing, it is key to reduce barriers to firm entry and growth and address skilled labour shortages. Weak external demand and high uncertainty have weighed on economic activity Real GDP increased by 1.7% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (saar) in the first quarter of 2025, mainly driven by private consumption and investment. Energy prices remain higher than before the war in Ukraine, particularly affecting output in energy-intensive industries. Monthly manufacturing production increased by 3% in March and was 0.2% below the level a year earlier. Despite an increase of real wages by 3.1% in 2024, the recovery of private consumption has been slow due to high domestic policy uncertainty. However, since the federal elections in February and a reform of the fiscal rules in March, policy uncertainty has declined. The ifo business expectations indicator has increased since March, despite higher trade policy uncertainty. Retail sale volumes decreased in March by 0.2% but stood 2.2% above the previous year’s level. Annual headline inflation declined to 2.2 % in April from 2.3% in March, mainly driven by declining energy prices. However, core inflation remains sticky, at 3.1% in April, due to strong services price inflation of 4.5% driven by strong nominal wage gains. Although labour markets have cooled, they remain robust with low unemployment and high vacancies still signalling strong labour shortages. Rising trade protection and increasing competition from China in key export markets have weighed on export volumes, which strongly declined in the second half of 2024. However, in March 2025, nominal exports were 2.3% above the level observed one year earlier, helped by rising export prices and a structural shift in manufacturing towards higher value-added products. The recent rise in uncertainty about future US trade policy also led to a front-loading of exports in the first quarter of 2025. Higher US tariffs will strongly affect manufacturing firms as about 10% of total goods exports are shipped to the United States. 164  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Germany 1 Source: Federal Statistical Office; Bundesbank; ifo business surveys; and GfK.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1qpxgz Defence spending and infrastructure investment are set to increase strongly The fiscal stance will tighten by 0.3% of GDP in 2025 and expand by 0.9% of GDP in 2026. Due to the fall of the previous coalition government and failure to conclude negotiations on the 2025 budget, a provisional budget for 2025 extends nominal spending levels from 2024 to 2025. However, a recent reform of the national fiscal rules will allow for raising investments in defence and infrastructure in the next few years. Additional spending exceeding 1% of GDP in the areas of defence, civil protection, intelligence services, protection of IT systems, and support for states attacked in violation of international law will be exempted from the fiscal rules. A special infrastructure fund will provide up to EUR 500 bn or about 12% of GDP for additional investment in infrastructure and the green transformation over the next 12 years. Moreover, the structural deficit ceiling for sub-national governments will be raised from 0% to 0.35% of GDP, and EUR 100 billion from the new infrastructure fund will be allocated to fund local public investment. The effects of this reform on public investment are expected to start materialising only in 2026 as the approval of the 2025 and 2026 budget and detailed investment plans as well as infrastructure planning and procurement procedures will take time. Negotiations to form a new coalition government have been successful. The policy plans laid out in the coalition treaty emphasise the need to strengthen defence and internal security, address the large infrastructure backlog, revive the stagnating economy, modernise and digitalise the public administration, and address skilled labour shortages. It is planned to raise depreciation allowances for equipment investment, reduce the electricity tax and network charges, raise subsidies for energy-intensive firms, and support the car industry by increasing subsidies for electric vehicles and the commuter allowance. Labour supply incentives are planned to be raised by exempting additional income from working extra-hours, wage premia if switching from part-time to full time work, and earnings of workers above the statutory retirement age from labour taxes. 166  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 The recovery will be driven by domestic demand GDP will grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. Private consumption will increase due to low inflation, rising nominal wages and declining domestic policy uncertainty. High trade policy uncertainty will hamper investment in export-oriented manufacturing but, overall, private investment will pick up, supported by high corporate savings, declining interest rates and decreasing domestic policy uncertainty, including on the financing of measures to support firms during the green transition. Public investment in defence and infrastructure will rise strongly due to the increased flexibility in the fiscal rules and large investment needs. Rising US tariffs will weigh on export demand. Headline inflation will converge towards 2% in 2026, but core inflation will be sticky, reflecting the impact of wage gains amidst skilled labour shortages and rising public investment and domestic demand. A further escalation in trade policy tensions would weigh on GDP, as the manufacturing sector is strongly integrated in global supply chains and the United States is the main export market. If public procurement and infrastructure planning and approval procedures are not accelerated, the implementation of public investment projects will be delayed, reducing GDP growth in 2026. Moreover, if structural reforms to support the supply side of the economy are not implemented, the significant demand shock from increased public investment may lead to strongly rising inflationary pressures. Structural reforms should complement the reform of fiscal rules Further simplification and harmonisation of public procurement, infrastructure planning and approval procedures should be combined with improvements to the capacity of public administration, particularly at the local level. This will ensure a quick and efficient implementation of public investment projects. To avoid rising inflationary pressures, it is key to combine the reform of the fiscal rules with structural reforms. Reducing high administrative burdens and regulatory barriers to entry and growth of firms, particularly in construction and services, is key to strengthen competition and revive business dynamism, investment and innovation. This will require accelerating the digitalization of the public administration, including by setting mandatory common IT standards, and expanding efforts to review, simplify and harmonise existing regulations and administrative procedures across levels of government. Occupational entry regulations and licensing requirements to open a business should be reduced to strengthen competition. Shifting the tax burden away from labour towards capital income and wealth, for example by reducing inheritance tax exemptions for business assets, would help improve labour supply incentives. Reducing fiscal incentives for early retirement would improve work incentives for older workers and help to stabilise pension spending amidst rising fiscal pressures due to ageing. To address skilled labour shortages, it is key to expand training opportunities for workers and the unemployed, including support for completing formal VET degrees.  167 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Greece GDP growth is projected to remain resilient at 2.0% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Disbursements of EU Recovery and Resilience Funds will strengthen investment, and minimum wage increases will support a pick-up in consumption, as exports slow alongside external demand. Headline inflation will ease to 2.0% in 2026, helped by lower oil prices, despite rising trade costs and persistent services inflation. Implementation delays of EU funds, excessive wage growth or renewed extreme weather events could dampen the outlook. Sizeable primary fiscal surpluses are projected in 2025 and in 2026, at 2.1% and 2.2% of GDP respectively, underpinned by improved tax compliance. Keeping public debt on a firmly declining path should remain a priority, as ageing costs and investment needs add to future spending pressures. Maintaining the reform momentum to improve the business environment and ease high labour shortages would support investment growth. Continuing efforts to reduce tax evasion and limit tax expenditures would raise revenues, while making room to reduce the labour tax on low-wage earners, and encouraging further employment gains. The economy remains strong The economy grew by 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by investment. Business expectations in manufacturing and service sectors have softened but continued to point towards expansion in April 2025. Employment rose by 0.5% in the year to March 2025, while nominal wages grew by 5.4% in the year to the fourth quarter of 2024, with labour shortages remaining historically high. Annual headline inflation remained elevated at 2.6% in April 2025 and core inflation stood at 3.8%, driven by services price inflation.

Lending to non-financial corporations from August 2024 to March 2025 was 14% higher than a year earlier. Interest rates for new loans to households and firms fell from 5.7% in August 2024 to 4.3% in March 2025. The trade deficit widened in 2024, with import growth outpacing exports amidst moderate growth in tourism. Travel receipts over the second half of 2024 were 1.8% higher than a year earlier, down from high growth rates in previous years, and exports of goods in the fourth quarter of 2024 were 3.3% lower compared than a year earlier. Trade links with the United States are limited, but new US tariffs will also weigh on exports by lowering demand from trading partners such as Germany. Fiscal policy will remain supportive The fiscal stance will remain supportive, as disbursements of Recovery and Resilience grants and loans are projected to rise from 1.8% of GDP in 2024 to 3.6% in 2026. Stronger tax revenues, bolstered by enhanced tax collection measures, are projected to support sustained primary surpluses and create room for additional spending. A primary surplus of 2.1% of GDP in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026 will contribute to a further decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 140% in 2026 (Maastricht definition). New fiscal measures for 2025 include a reduction in social security contributions by 1 percentage point (0.2% of 2024 GDP) and permanent increases of incomes for pensioners (0.2% of GDP) and public servants (0.1% of GDP).

Public sector wages, which were frozen, are being raised to align with the rising minimum wage. Growth will remain resilient GDP growth is projected to remain resilient at 2.0% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Rising disposable income will support a pick-up in consumption. Investment growth, supported by growing disbursements of Recovery and Resilience Funds, will remain robust despite heightened international uncertainty. Rising labour shortages will moderate employment growth while supporting rising wages. New US tariffs and easing external demand, notably from EU trading partners, will slow export growth. Headline inflation is projected to return slowly towards 2.0% in 2026 amidst persistent core inflation. Implementation delays of the Recovery and Resilience Plan “Greece 2.0” could put the planned investment growth at risk. If wage growth were to persistently outpace productivity gains, this could weaken exports further. Extreme weather events, such as the 2023 floods in Thessaly, could also weigh on domestic demand. Strengthening investment further is a key challenge The still high public debt level poses risks in the medium-term, while population ageing and climate change add to future domestic spending pressures. Low productivity continues to hold back competitiveness and living standards. Boosting investment will be key to strengthening growth while maintaining public debt on a firmly declining path. This will require an easing of remaining regulatory burdens and improvements in workers’ skills. Formalising and accelerating the review of existing business regulations while ensuring an effective consultation of stakeholders on new legislation would help continue recent success with making the regulatory framework more business friendly. Strengthening vocational training, rebalancing labour market policies towards training and counselling for unemployed workers and ensuring high training quality would reduce skill mismatches. Further reducing tax evasion and limiting tax expenditures – notably reduced VAT rates, which mostly benefit wealthy households – would raise revenue, making room for targeted social contribution cuts to strengthen work incentives. 170  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Hungary After growing by 0.5% in 2024, GDP is projected to increase by 0.9% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026. Private consumption, supported by real wage growth, will be the main engine of growth, especially in 2025. Following a significant decline in 2024, investment is expected to increase gradually but will remain hampered by weak economic prospects and trade policy uncertainty. Exports are projected to pick-up in line with demand from Hungary’s main trading partners, but growth in the euro area, particularly Germany, is a key risk for the economy. Monetary policy easing is expected to continue, but at a moderate pace to ensure that inflation reverts back to target. While necessary to prepare for rising ageing-related spending needs, fiscal consolidation is weakening. Better financing conditions, lower trade policy uncertainty and full implementation of recent public integrity reforms will be key to support a rebound in investment. Reforming the insolvency framework would facilitate capital reallocation towards productive investments. Improving regulations in energy, transport and professional services would encourage business creation. Economic activity is weak Economic growth has been volatile since 2023, with alternating quarters of positive and negative GDP growth. In 2024 as a whole, GDP growth was only 0.5% and GDP declined by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025. While strong real wage growth supported private consumption, there was a strong decline in investment due to low business confidence, low capacity utilisation and tight financing conditions as monetary policy remained restrictive to fight remaining inflationary pressures. Headline inflation ticked up to 5.6% in February 2025 due higher food and energy prices. It was still 4.2% in April and core inflation remains above 5%. Despite subdued economic activity, the labour market is robust. Unemployment declined to 4.2% in March 2025 and job vacancies are high. Hungary 1.

Higher US tariffs on EU goods will thus indirectly weigh on Hungary through reduced activity in the European Union and Germany, representing 65% and 21% of total Hungarian exports, respectively. Monetary policy is expected to continue easing at a moderate pace and the fiscal stance to weaken in 2026 Given persistent services inflation and exchange rate weakening, the central bank has kept its policy rate at 6.5% since September 2024. Looking ahead, it is expected to implement gradual and small policy rate cuts to ensure that inflation reverts back to the 3% target. The policy rate is projected to settle around 5.5% by the end of 2026. The headline fiscal deficit is expected to narrow from 4.9% of GDP in 2024 to 4.2% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026, which is still higher than before the pandemic. Abstracting from business cycle developments and interest payments, the fiscal stance is projected to be neutral in 2025 and to weaken in 2026, after two years of significant fiscal consolidation. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Hungary Current prices HUF billion GDP at market prices 55 560.5 4.3 -0.8 0.5 0.9 2.4 Private consumption 26 761.3 6.9 -1.0 5.1 5.4 3.9 Government consumption 11 552.0 3.2 3.3 -4.6 0.6 0.9 Gross fixed capital formation 15 144.2 0.7 -7.7 -11.1 -3.0 5.4 Final domestic demand 53 457.5 4.2 -2.1 -1.4 2.3 3.6 Stockbuilding¹ 2 041.0 0.2 -3.6 1.2 -0.2 0.0 Total domestic demand 55 498.4 4.2 -5.1 -0.1 2.2 3.6 Exports of goods and services 44 126.5 10.7 1.7 -3.0 -0.4 2.4 Imports of goods and services 44 064.5 10.7 -3.4 -4.0 1.2 4.1 Net exports¹ 62.0 0.0 4.8 0.6 -1.2 -1.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 14.2 15.2 7.3 6.5 4.0 Consumer price index _ 14.6 17.1 3.7 4.9 3.6 Core inflation index² _ 10.2 13.8 5.7 5.2 3.6 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.6 4.1 4.5 4.3 3.9 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 11.8 14.4 15.5 12.8 12.2 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -6.2 -6.7 -4.9 -4.2 -4.0 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 77.5 81.9 82.2 81.7 82.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 73.9 73.0 73.5 73.5 74.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -8.6 0.3 2.2 1.6 0.5 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) 2.

Private consumption will be supported by strong real wage growth, especially in 2025, and the household saving rate returning to its long-run level after a significant increase since the pandemic. Inflation is projected to be slightly above 3% by the end of 2026. Investment is expected to rebound progressively but will be hampered by low business confidence, low capacity utilisation, and significant trade policy uncertainty. Exports are projected to pick up but will remain closely connected to external demand from Hungary’s main trading partners, especially Germany. Economic activity in these countries is a key risk to the outlook. The availability of new manufacturing capacity, especially in the automotive sector, may provide a further boost to Hungarian exports over 2025-26, but industrial capacity utilisation is currently low and the potential of the new factories will be fully exploited only if external demand picks up significantly. Structural reforms would improve fiscal sustainability and long-term growth Reforming public pensions would limit the increase in ageing-related spending, which is projected to exceed 5 percentage points of GDP by 2070 under current legislation. Beyond possible options to tighten eligibility conditions and adjust benefit levels, financing future pensions will require additional fiscal space, which calls for consolidation. As a share of GDP, investment remains higher than the EU average but has significantly weakened in recent years. Better financing conditions, reduced trade policy uncertainty, and fully implementing recent reforms to promote public integrity and bolster investor confidence will be key to reverse this trend. Improving the insolvency framework would also facilitate the reallocation of capital across firms and the financing of productive investments. Improved regulations in the energy, transport, professional services and telecommunication sectors would strengthen competition and support the entry of new firms and investments in these sectors.  173 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Iceland GDP growth is set to recover to 1.4% in 2025 and 2.8% in 2026, driven by household consumption and the rebound of exports. Business investment will be strong in 2025 but weaken in 2026 as several projects will end. Unemployment will edge up, but the labour market remains tight. Major risks include a violent volcanic eruption and further tariff escalation affecting Iceland’s main export goods. In May, the central bank cut the policy rate to 7.5%, the fifth cut since monetary easing started in October 2024. Inflation has fallen to around 4% and is expected to reach the target by the second half of 2026. The new government has committed to a tight fiscal stance over the next two years, which will help underpin disinflation and build up fiscal space. Reforming the fiscal framework and business regulation will help increase stability and sustainability of the public finances and foster productivity, investment and growth. Economic growth has likely bottomed out Economic growth has slowed against the backdrop of tight monetary policy but seems to have passed its low point. Household consumption is expanding gradually, driven by growing real wages following the 2024 agreements and rising consumer confidence. The wage agreements of 2024 imply wage increases of over 6% per year including wage drift. Business investment has begun to recover from the downturn in the second half of 2024 as financial conditions eased. Despite slowing population growth, investment in housing remains substantial, supported by rising incomes. Exports have rebounded, particularly in the fisheries sector, which benefits from increased catch quotas. The unemployment rate has risen slightly from around 3.5% at the end of 2024. Volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula has had minimal impact over the past six months. Various inflation measures have declined sharply, but annual headline inflation, at 4.2% in April, is still well above the 2.5% target. Iceland 1. Year-on-year growth rates.

Icelandic goods are subject to a general 10% US import tariff. The additional increase in US tariffs on aluminium imports from 10% to 25% in March has had little effect so far, as Iceland does not export aluminium to the United States. Monetary policy is easing, while fiscal policy remains contractionary The central bank began easing monetary policy in early autumn 2024 and has cut the key interest rate to 7.5% by May 2025. It is projected to be lowered further throughout 2025 and more gradually thereafter, to around 5% by end-2026. The trade-weighted exchange rate has appreciated since early 2025, largely due to a weaker USD. Fiscal policy, as indicated by the underlying primary balance, will be tightened further by approximately 1.4% of GDP in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026. These measures will help alleviate inflationary pressures and build fiscal space. Gross public debt will decline further as the government-owned Housing Financing Fund is wound down. The economy is set to recover gradually The economy is projected to grow by 1.4% in 2025 and 2.8% in 2026. Private consumption will expand, driven by real wage increases. Residential investment will remain robust, supported by improving financial conditions and sustained housing demand. Business investment is projected to grow as confidence rises and financial conditions continue to ease.

However, it could exceed expectations if import prices, especially for food and oil, begin to rise again. Escalating trade tensions could strangle goods exports and dent tourism if disposable incomes decline in the countries raising tariffs. Volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula and near the capital area could cause further infrastructure damage and require additional public relief spending. Reforming the fiscal framework would strengthen public finances Replacing the current budget balance rule with a structural spending rule could mitigate pro-cyclical fiscal policy, enhancing the stability and sustainability of public finances. The introduction of resource taxes, including the planned reform of fishing fees and the implementation of a new visitor tax, will support the sustainable management of natural resources. Eliminating exemptions in the value-added tax, particularly by reinstating the standard VAT rate on tourism services, will reduce distortions within the tax system. Lowering barriers to market entry will encourage investment. Easing the licensing and permit system for various professions and accelerating further the recognition of foreign diplomas will help to boost productivity and alleviate labour shortages. 176  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 India Real GDP is projected to grow by 6.3% in fiscal year 2025-26 and 6.4% in 2026-27. Private consumption will gradually strengthen, driven by rising real incomes that are helped by moderate inflation, recent tax cuts and a strengthening of the labour market. Investment will be supported by declining interest rates and substantial public capital spending, but higher US tariffs will weigh on exports. Inflation will remain contained at around 4% as economic activity grows around trend. A less benign monsoon season or higher global commodity prices could drive up food prices and inflation. The Union Budget for the fiscal year 2025–26 foresees a moderate fiscal consolidation, aiming to reduce the headline budget deficit from 4.8% of GDP in fiscal year 2024-25 to 4.4% in 2025-26. With inflation firmly within the target range, monetary policy is gradually expected to become more accommodative. Better targeting of energy and fertiliser subsidies, and an overhaul of tax expenditures, could enhance spending efficiency and free resources for other policy priorities. Improving logistics efficiency, upgrading digital infrastructure, and enhancing policy predictability, particularly in tax administration, could bolster private investment. Domestic demand supports activity Real GDP expanded by 6.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of FY2024-25, supported by robust domestic demand and strong investment. High-frequency indicators suggest that economic activity remained solid in the fourth quarter. Industrial production rose by 3.7% year-on-year in the first four months of 2025, with the manufacturing sector regaining strength. India’s current account deficit widened in the first three quarters of FY2024-25, due to a persistent merchandise trade deficit that was only partially offset by strong services exports. More recent data suggest a slight improvement in the trade balance. The labour market was resilient in 2024 with the labour force participation rate increasing to 45.1% and employment continuing to rise. Survey data from early 2025 show optimism in the labour market, especially in sectors such as information technology, retail, and finance. Monetary conditions remain restrictive, despite policy rate cuts in February and April. Headline inflation eased to 3.2% in April 2025 and is now within the central bank’s target range of 4% ± 2%, largely due to a substantial moderation in food inflation, which accounts for nearly half of the CPI basket, and declining energy prices. Easing food prices reflect a strong autumn harvest, and government interventions, such as export restrictions. As a major oil importer, India has benefited from lower global crude oil prices in recent months, which reduced domestic fuel costs and helped contain input costs in energy-intensive sectors such as transport, manufacturing, and agriculture. While core inflation remains slightly above 4%, wage growth remains moderate. High merchandise export exposure to the United States, which is India’s largest export market, increases the vulnerability of private investment to shifts in trade policy. Tariff increases and broader trade tensions may damp investor sentiment, particularly in export-oriented sectors such as chemicals, textiles, and electronics. However, the overall GDP effects will be limited by the moderate share of exports in GDP, with merchandise exports towards the United States accounting for only 2.1% of GDP.  177 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 India 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1e0bsf Monetary policy is expected to ease amid rising public investment The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its current easing cycle in February 2025, followed by a second policy rate cut in April. Despite the cumulative 50 basis point reduction, which lowered the policy rate from 6.5% to 6.0%, financial conditions remain tight. Monetary policy is expected to ease further over FY2025– 26 as headline inflation remains within the target range over 2025 due to the moderation of food and energy prices, which make up a large share of the consumer price index. Low global commodity prices and a broadly balanced output gap are helping to contain demand-side pressures. In addition, the credibility of the RBI’s inflation-targeting framework continues to anchor inflation expectations. With headline inflation expected to remain within the target range in the following years and inflation expectations projected to remain anchored, there is scope for the central bank to reduce the policy rate towards a more neutral level. A further 25-basis point cut is expected by the end of 2025. The central government is expected to pursue fiscal consolidation, bringing the budget deficit from 4.8% of GDP in FY 2024-25 to 4.4% in FY 2025-26, with local governments projected to adopt a similar stance. The adjustment relies primarily on higher revenues. Although the recently approved Union Budget includes income tax cuts for middle-income households, overall tax revenues are projected to increase by 0.3% of GDP, partly reflecting the positive impact of tax code simplification and digitalisation on compliance. On the expenditure side, total spending is set to decline by 0.1% of GDP, largely reflecting reduced subsidies. Public capital expenditure and defence spending are maintained at their current levels as a share of GDP. Private demand will drive growth amid emerging external headwinds Real GDP is projected to grow by 6.3% in FY2025-26 and 6.4% in FY2026-27. Private consumption is supported by rising real incomes and lower personal income taxes. Investment will remain strong, bolstered by easing financial conditions. However, export growth is expected to slow due to weaker global demand, the impact of higher tariffs and heightened trade policy uncertainty. Headline inflation is projected to average 4.1% in FY2025-26 and 4.0% in FY2026-27. Inflation expectations remain well anchored, and wage pressures are expected to remain contained with the economy projected to grow around potential, suggesting limited demand-driven inflation pressures.  179 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 The balance of risks is tilted to the downside. The summer monsoon is projected to be normal. A less benign monsoon would reduce agricultural output and rural incomes, push up food prices, and weigh on GDP. The agricultural sector accounts for over 15% of GDP and employs a large share of the population. Additionally, the risk of increased trade tensions, including the imposition of higher US tariffs on Indian exports, could dampen external demand and harm export-oriented sectors such as textiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Trade tensions may also discourage private investment in tradable sectors. Stronger-than-expected remittances and investment inflows, coupled with robust infrastructure implementation, could lift growth above current projections. Fiscal prudence and reforms are important to sustain growth Phasing out tax expenditures, rationalising subsidies, and expanding tax bases would improve the quality and sustainability of public finances, creating room for expanding social protection, higher public investment, and active labour market policies. Emphasis should be placed on policies that raise labour force participation, especially among women. Although female employment has increased markedly, from 17.5% in FY2017–18 to 31.7% in FY2023–24, strengthening women’s access to formal jobs will require coordinated reforms in childcare availability, safe and affordable transportation, skill-building, and enforcement of workplace protections. India has scope to accelerate trade liberalisation, simplify customs procedures, and reduce tariffs. Further reforms are needed to improve the efficiency of logistics networks, upgrade digital infrastructure, and reduce regulatory uncertainty, especially in tax administration. Enhancing the availability and accessibility of long-term finance, including through deepening capital markets and improving credit access for SMEs, would further strengthen the investment climate. 180  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Indonesia Real GDP is projected to grow by 4.7% in 2025 and 4.8% in 2026. Low inflation and easing financial conditions will spur private consumption and investment. However, uncertainty about domestic fiscal policy will temper these gains, while export growth is expected to slow amid global trade tensions. Inflation is projected to pick up to 2.3% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, as the recent depreciation of the currency gradually feeds into domestic prices. The current account deficit is expected to widen modestly, but a further decline in commodity prices could exacerbate this by driving down export revenues. Monetary policy is expected to continue to ease over 2025 and 2026, as inflationary pressures remain contained amid soft growth. Fiscal policy is projected to be broadly neutral in 2025, as increased spending on a free meals programme and additional public investment through the new sovereign wealth fund (“Danantara”) will be financed by spending cuts elsewhere. Reducing regulatory barriers to foreign investment and raising the efficiency of public spending through improved targeting of social benefits to vulnerable households are key medium-term policy priorities. Reducing informality would help improve social protection and raise tax revenues. The economy is going through a soft patch Annual seasonally unadjusted real GDP growth slowed to 4.9% in the first quarter of 2025, amid soft investment, stable household consumption and a positive contribution from net exports. While the unemployment rate declined to 4.8% in the first quarter of 2025, among the lowest values in two decades, the economy appears to have slowed, as consumer and business sentiment deteriorated and prices of key export commodities declined. Low inflation is supporting real household incomes, but high borrowing costs continue to weigh on investment. Inflation has come down from around 6% in the second half of 2022 to 2% in April 2025, on the back of monetary policy tightening, the normalisation of food and commodity prices and a temporary electricity price discount in January and February of 2025. The phase-out of the price discount and the depreciation of the currency – around 4% relative to the US dollar since the beginning of the year – will put upward pressure on prices in the near term, but core inflation remains close to the mid-point of the central bank’s target band of 1.5-3.5% and inflation expectations are stable. Exposure to higher US import tariffs is relatively limited, with goods exports to the United States amounting to less than 2% of GDP.  181 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Indonesia 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/t3cdvl Macroeconomic policies are becoming less restrictive Monetary policy is expected to ease over 2025-26. The central bank initiated the ongoing easing cycle in August 2024, bringing the policy rate from 6.25% to 5.5% in May, but financial conditions remain restrictive. With stable inflation expectations and domestic demand growth projected to be below trend, there is room for the central bank to further reduce the policy rate towards a more neutral level of around 5%. Pursuing a data-dependent approach that balances support to economic growth and close monitoring of price pressures from the recent currency depreciation is key to durably maintain inflation within the central bank’s target band. The government budget deficit is expected to increase from 2.3% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025. The expansion of a free meals programme for schoolchildren and pregnant women and the creation of a new sovereign wealth fund, as well as foregone revenue from a temporary electricity price discount in early 2025 will put upward pressure of around 1.6% of GDP on the budget deficit. This will be mitigated by across-the-board spending cuts amounting to around 1.3% of GDP, which will maintain the budget deficit below the statutory limit of 3% of GDP. Despite the rising budget deficit, the fiscal policy stance will be neutral in 2025, as only part of the funds transferred to the new sovereign wealth fund will translate into new public investment outlays in 2025. Accelerating disbursements from the new sovereign wealth fund in the near term while ensuring transparency and accountability in its management would support growth in 2025, which appears appropriate amid rising uncertainty about the growth outlook. Gradually raising government revenue from 2026 would put public debt – which is currently around 40% of GDP – on a declining path. Growth is expected to slow in the near term Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 4.7% in 2025 before picking up slightly to 4.8% in 2026. The recent weakening of business and consumer sentiment amid fiscal policy uncertainty and high borrowing costs will weigh on private consumption and investment in the first half of 2025. As financial conditions gradually ease, inflation remains comfortably within the central bank’s target band, and public investment outlays  183 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 from the new sovereign wealth fund gather momentum, domestic demand is expected to gradually increase over the second half of 2025 and 2026. The recent escalation of global trade tensions and the decline in commodity prices are expected to weigh on external demand and export revenues. Inflation is expected to gradually rise to the mid-point of the central bank’s target range, as the effects of the temporary electricity price discount at the beginning of 2025 fade, and the recent depreciation of the currency gradually feeds into domestic prices. Risks are tilted to the downside. Persistent capital outflows driven by global and domestic policy uncertainty could place renewed pressure on the currency, potentially leading to a temporary widening of the current account deficit and fuelling inflation through higher import costs. Additionally, a larger-than-expected slowdown in China – Indonesia’s largest export market – would further weigh on export performance, particularly in commodity sectors. On the upside, swift and effective deployment of the newly established sovereign wealth fund could catalyse private investment by crowding in capital and accelerate the implementation of high-impact infrastructure and industrial projects. Structural reforms are needed to boost growth Recent reforms have reduced barriers to foreign investment, but significant barriers to foreign equity ownership remain, especially in the telecommunications and transportation sectors. Moreover, the investment climate is affected by overlapping regulations, uneven policy implementation, and limited coordination among government agencies. Further reforms in this area will become increasingly relevant in the context of global trade policy uncertainty and the potential reconfiguration of supply chains. Addressing infant malnutrition through the free meals programme will strengthen public health, but improved targeting to vulnerable households would ensure that funds are spent more efficiently. Reforms to reduce informality would help broaden the tax base and create fiscal space for the expansion of public investment, including transport infrastructure and clean energy, as well as health and education spending. Shifting the funding of maternity leave from employers to social insurance, in particular for smaller firms and self-employed women, would help raise female labour force participation. 184  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Ireland GDP growth is projected to be 3.7% in 2025, before moderating to 2.3% in 2026, as trade fragmentation weighs on export-oriented sectors. On the domestic side, heightened uncertainty will encourage households to save more, despite sustained nominal wage growth underpinned by a tight labour market. Modified domestic demand, which controls for the major distortions arising from the activity of multinationals, is projected to expand by 2.2% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026, below its long-term average of 2.7%. As the United States is Ireland’s biggest export market and multinationals play a large role in Irish exports and tax revenues, higher tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers would lower growth and exacerbate medium-term fiscal challenges. Prioritising productivity-enhancing reforms, spending efficiency, and stricter domestic fiscal controls will be key. Planned infrastructure investment should be implemented, albeit properly sequenced to avoid adding to inflation. The strong labour market shores up the domestic economy According to preliminary estimates, GDP grew strongly by 3.2% in the first quarter of 2025, mainly reflecting strong exports of pharmaceuticals despite considerable global uncertainty. Amidst persistent population growth, the labour market was robust in early 2025, with strong job creation and low unemployment. After easing considerably in late 2024, headline inflation bounced back to 2.0% in April, driven mostly by food prices, while stronger services price growth pushed core inflation up to 2.4%. Consumer spending rebounded by end-2024, driven by sustained wage growth underpinned by labour shortages. Buoyant VAT revenues indicate ongoing strength in private consumption in early 2025. Going forward, tariff-related uncertainties will weigh on consumer confidence. Ireland 1. Deflated by the harmonised index of consumer prices.

An extension of the tariff to currently exempt pharmaceuticals, or a tightening of non-tariff barriers on services trade, could weigh heavily on growth. Exports of pharmaceuticals – largely from US-owned multinationals – to the United States, Ireland’s largest single export market, surged to EUR 44 billion in 2024, out of total goods exports of EUR 73 billion. Multinational\u0002dominated trade with the United States in intellectual property products, computer, and business services accounts for about 25% of Ireland’s services trade. Public spending pressures are mounting Looming risks warrant greater fiscal prudence. Underlying tax revenue growth remained strong in early 2025. As Budget 2025 measures – worth 2.0% of 2024 GDP; 3.6% of GNI* – are being rolled out, public spending is surging. In addition to higher public investment and a set of loosely targeted new cost-of-living initiatives, the package includes permanent current spending increases and tax measures to offset income threshold effects. Higher spending and weaker tax revenues due to second-round effects from the 10% tariff on US goods imports from the European Union, and the further extension of reduced VAT rates on electricity and gas to end-October 2025, will lower the budget surplus to 1.3% of GDP (2.2% of GNI*) in 2025. The fiscal stance is slightly expansionary in the projection period, even assuming no income-support measures in 2026.

Hence, modified domestic demand is projected to expand by just over 2% annually through 2026, though GDP growth is projected at 3.7% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026. Higher input costs and services prices will push headline inflation up to 2.1% in 2025, despite milder energy price pressures, while core inflation will reach 2.3%, before both ease slightly in 2026. Given the key role of a few large foreign\u0002owned multinationals in export-oriented sectors, like pharmaceuticals or advanced computer and business services, higher general or industry-specific tariffs or non-tariff barriers could lower growth and adversely impact fiscal balances. On the upside, manufacturing multinationals’ significant sunk investments in both labour and capital equipment may help mitigate the impact of tariffs on growth. Amid significant skills shortages, the employment correction to the shock might be softened by firms’ reluctance to shed staff. Tackling infrastructure bottlenecks remains a priority Higher investment in housing, transport and energy infrastructure is essential to maintain foreign investor confidence and preserve living standards. While tariffs could lower corporate and personal income tax revenues, excess corporate tax receipts should continue to be allocated to the long-term savings funds, which are intended to address ageing-related costs and support medium-term productivity-enhancing investment. Additionally, greater emphasis should be placed on improving spending efficiency – supported by comprehensive spending reviews, stricter domestic fiscal guard-rails, and better-targeted income support where needed. Boosting work incentives in the tax and benefit system, alongside improving the supply of quality vocational pathways for low-skilled workers, could help alleviate labour and skills shortages. Easing SMEs’ access to R&D funding and to tailored lifelong learning programmes, via the National Training Fund, could help foster domestic investment in digitalisation and innovation, and result in more even productivity gains.  187 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Israel Economic activity is on a path to expand by 3.3% in 2025 and by 4.9% in 2026. The ceasefire in Lebanon at the end of 2024 brought a significant improvement in the economic environment spurring exports and private consumption. With a tight labour market and lingering supply constraints, inflation is anticipated to remain high at 3.2% in 2025 before moderating to 2.9% in 2026. Risks are substantial, hinging on regional geopolitical developments. Implementing the fiscal consolidation planned for 2025-2026 is important to secure fiscal sustainability while creating buffers. Monetary policy must remain tight to ensure that inflation durably falls back within the 1-3% target range. Strong population growth necessitates investment in physical and education infrastructure accompanied by reforms to remove regulatory barriers and restructure the education system so that it can deliver high-quality teaching for all. The recovery is accelerating The economic recovery has gathered strength since the ceasefire in Lebanon at the end of 2024, with GDP expanding at an annualised rate of 3.4% in the first quarter of 2025. By removing most of the threat of rocket fire over the north and centre of the country, the ceasefire strongly improved the economic environment with long-term bond yields consequently falling by more than half a percentage point since October 2024. Foreign airlines returned to the Tel Aviv airport, facilitating international business and a recovery of high-tech investment. The improvement in living conditions enabled consumption to remain strong. Despite the one-percentage point VAT rise at the start of 2025, credit card purchases by March 2025 overtook their level in December 2024, which had been boosted by advance buying ahead of the VAT increase.

Tariffs on the 28% of Israeli merchandise exports that ship to the United States average below 7%. Services, which make up much of Israel’s exports to the United States, remain outside the scope of the new US tariffs. The effective exchange rate appreciation since October 2024 is also reducing import price inflation. Imports of goods are also facilitated by the “What’s good for Europe is good for Israel” reform, whereby goods meeting EU standards across a wide range of categories are deemed compliant with Israeli standards. Macroeconomic policy is adequately tight The fiscal stance is set to tighten in 2025 and 2026. After rising from 4.2% of GDP in 2022 to 8.0% in 2024, military expenditure will fall, albeit to a higher level than before October 2023. Simultaneously, government receipts are poised to rise in 2025-2026 following the VAT rate increase, the new tax on undistributed profits of some holding companies, the increase in national insurance contributions, the freeze of personal income tax brackets and other revenue-generating measures. Despite this fiscal tightening and the currency appreciation, monetary policy is expected to remain restrictive as, at 3.6% in April 2025, inflation lies above the 1-3% target range, while the labour market remains very tight with 2.7% unemployment in April 2025. Furthermore, persistent labour shortages in construction constrain supply. The private sector is set to drive growth Activity is set to expand by 3.3% in 2025 and 4.9% in 2026 under the impetus of private consumption and exports. Inflation is anticipated to reach 3.2% in 2025 reflecting a very tight labour market and lagged effects of acute supply constraints in 2024.

Risks are large but balanced. On the upside, a peaceful settlement of ongoing conflicts would reduce sovereign risk. New diplomatic agreements with countries in the region would durably boost trade. On the downside, broader regional conflict could result in economic contraction and a large widening of fiscal deficits. Deepening unrest in relation with judicial reform plans could also derail high-tech dynamism, especially if it involved significant high-skilled labour emigration. Forward-looking economic management is paramount Macroeconomic policy needs to remain prudent to keep the economy on track for a balanced recovery. Besides maintaining the revenue-raising instruments already deployed, the government should lower transfers and subsidies that can discourage labour market participation. Monetary policy needs to remain restrictive until inflation is set to come durably into the target range. Looking ahead, strong demographic growth calls for substantial investment in physical capital, to address infrastructure gaps, and in education, to maintain the strong skills base that the high-tech sector and the rest of the economy require to reap the dividends of AI and digitisation. In addition, infrastructure and education both require structural reforms to remove unnecessary regulatory obstacles to entry, competition and investment and ensure that the education system works well for pupils across population groups. 190  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Italy GDP growth is expected to slow slightly to 0.6% in 2025 and pick up to 0.7% in 2026. Global trade policy disruptions are expected to drag on growth. Higher real wages are set to support consumer demand. Investment will be boosted by accelerated implementation of National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) projects. Export volumes are poised to stagnate in 2025 due to more restrictive trade policy settings and sluggish demand in key European markets. Downside risks dominate, including the uncertain response of investors and employers to global policy developments. Faster implementation of NRRP projects or stronger export demand from other European countries would bolster growth. Continuing fiscal consolidation is projected in 2025 and 2026, as the government remains committed to reducing the fiscal deficit and putting the public finances on a sustainable medium-term path. Progress implementing the NRRP should encourage greater private investment and employment in the medium term. Sustaining living standards in the longer term will require improving opportunities for graduating youth and older workers to update their skills to meet the needs of the labour market. Weaker industrial production has weighed on GDP growth GDP expanded by 0.7% in 2024, with weak growth in the second half of the year. Export volumes fell. Industrial production was 1.8% lower in March 2025 than a year earlier and has fallen for over two years. The weakness is broadly-based, with motor vehicles and parts production especially weak. Investment has been dragged by lower housing construction with the winding-down of the generous Superbonus building tax credit from early 2024. Private consumption was buoyed by support to disposable incomes from rising employment and wages and moderate underlying inflation. The unemployment rate was 6% in March 2025, near its lowest rate since prior to the global financial crisis. Italy is exposed to more restrictive US trade policy through higher tariffs on EU goods. Over 10% of Italy’s total goods exports in 2023 went to the United States. Moreover, the indirect effects may be significant, for example through global motor vehicle production chains or weaker demand globally. Italy is also exposed to growing competition from Chinese industrial products. Volatility in international energy prices has been transmitted into consumer prices. Higher gas prices in early 2025 contributed to headline inflation rising to 2.0% in the year to April 2025. In response, the government introduced a new support programme targeting lower income households. The fall in gas and petroleum prices in March and April 2025 is passing into producer and consumer prices.  191 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Italy 1 Source: Istat; and OECD Economic Outlook 117 database.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/helnfq Fiscal consolidation continues alongside implementation of the NRRP The fiscal deficit fell to 3.4% of GDP in 2024, 0.4 percentage points lower than the government had budgeted. A modest reduction is projected for 2025 and further consolidation in 2026, in line with the medium-term structural fiscal plan submitted to the European Commission. These are projected to reduce the headline budget deficit by 0.6% of GDP. The ramp-down in spending on the building tax credit is supporting consolidation, alongside positive revenue developments and some savings in ministries’ spending. The government expects these to be sufficient to offset planned income tax cuts and tax bracket consolidation, as well as planned increases in spending, including on health care and investment. The government also plans small increases in defence and national security spending, and to accelerate public investment spending, although this will mainly be in 2026. The improvement in the budget balance may be more modest than the government’s projections given the weakening growth outlook and increased pressures for defence and other spending. Italy has continued to make progress on implementing the reforms in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and spending rates have increased. Lower euro area interest rates are passing into lending and deposit rates. Household borrowing demand started rising in early 2025, although businesses continued to reduce their borrowing. Long-term government bond yields were broadly stable from mid-2024 to May 2025, while spreads relative to equivalent German government bond yields declined to about 105 basis points in mid-May 2025, after averaging around 125 basis points over the previous six months. Still, the government expects the interest cost of public debt to rise. Global trade policy developments will drag on the recovery in GDP growth Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 0.6% in 2025 and pick-up slightly to 0.7% in 2026. New global trade restrictions are expected to result in export volumes contracting slightly in 2026 – the first contraction since the global financial crisis (excluding the pandemic). Exports are expected to resume growing in 2026 as other European countries increase their investment and defence spending. Consumer demand is expected to remain resilient, despite the increased economic uncertainty, as real wages are supported by  193 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 firm employment and wage growth and moderate inflation. Investment is set to grow with the accelerating disbursement of NextGenerationEU-funded projects, while residential construction spending returns to longer-term average levels with the withdrawal of the Superbonus tax credits. Other business investment is poised to remain weak, despite lower financing costs, due to uncertainty over the global economic and policy environment. Headline inflation is set to ease as the increase in energy and fresh food prices fades, while underlying inflation will rise moderately with ongoing wage growth. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside due to the uncertainty created by global trade policy developments. New or retaliatory trade restrictions or more prolonged weakness in demand in the euro area may lead to a deeper contraction in exports than expected. Uncertainty over policy may lead to firms cutting investment and recruitment plans by more than expected and households cutting their expenditure to build precautionary savings. On the upside, more of the public investment projects funded through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) could be implemented than expected over 2025 and 2026. Raising the economy’s potential while proceeding with fiscal consolidation will support investment Achieving the planned fiscal consolidation will be necessary to ensure public debt is on a prudent path and to contain interest expenses. The high share of spending on pensions and rising spending pressures from ageing, climate and defence needs in the medium term require significant reforms. Raising property taxes and addressing tax evasion, and containing pension spending despite demographic pressures, can create room for public investment. Ensuring effective and timely disbursement of NextGenerationEU-funded projects will boost near-term demand and improve the investment climate into the longer-term. Simplifying the authorisation procedures for renewable energy and associated electricity grid investments would reduce the dependence on natural gas, lower energy costs and accelerate electrification. Bolstering the labour force will be central for private investment prospects. Improving school leavers’ readiness for the workforce, such as by boosting apprenticeships and advanced technical education, would help support the size and skills of the workforce, and improve the attractiveness of staying in Italy for young adults. Women’s participation would be raised by continuing to expand public support for care for children and other dependents. Expanding access to reskilling opportunities for adults to extend their working lives will also help address demographic challenges and the labour force’s needs. 194  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Japan Real GDP growth is projected at 0.7% in 2025, despite significant headwinds, before reverting towards potential in 2026, at 0.4%. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. Private consumption is set to increase as robust wage growth boosts households’ disposable income. Expanding profits and government subsidies, especially for green and digital investment, will support business investment, despite higher uncertainty. External demand will exert a drag on growth, reflecting the higher US tariffs. A surge in food prices will slightly raise headline consumer price inflation in 2025, before it eases towards the 2% target in 2026. Inflation above target over the past three years and robust wage growth warrant continued gradual policy interest rate increases, but high uncertainty calls for close monitoring and a data-driven pace. The primary fiscal balance is projected to improve absent additional supplementary budgets, which should be limited to large shocks. To increase fiscal buffers to address shocks and ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, a medium-term fiscal consolidation path is needed amid rising debt servicing costs. Structural reforms to boost productivity, including labour-saving and labour-augmenting investment, and employment are key to address demographic headwinds and raise potential growth. Robust profits and wage growth are supporting domestic demand While GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2025, domestic demand grew robustly. Business investment increased, supported by high corporate profits, and the order backlog of machinery rose to record highs. The Bank of Japan’s March Tankan Survey, which did not fully factor in the impact of US tariffs, pointed to robust future investment plans. Consumption remained flat in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting declining consumer confidence amidst high inflation, despite rising nominal wages and strong labour market performance. Annual headline consumer price inflation was 3.6% in April, due to sticky food inflation, despite the resumption of electricity and city gas subsidies between January and March. The outcome of the ongoing annual wage negotiations for FY2025, with a 3.8% base pay increase as of 2 May, is stronger than last year. Japan 1 1. As of 2 May. The horizontal axis shows fiscal years.

The impact on the Japanese economy will be direct, as for example automobile exports to the United Stares are high at 6% of total exports, and indirect through higher uncertainty and lower global growth. The projections assume no trade policy retaliation by Japan. Imports and inventories grew strongly in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting precautionary behaviour by firms in the face of higher trade uncertainty. Inbound tourism has expanded robustly, driven primarily by tourists from China. Macroeconomic support is projected to gradually decrease In January, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised the policy interest rate from around 0.25% to around 0.5%, the highest level in 17 years. The BoJ’s reduction of its monthly purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) by around JPY 400 billion each quarter, targeting about JPY 3 trillion by the first quarter of 2026 and roughly a 7-8% reduction in JGB holdings by March 2026, has been proceeding smoothly. Corporate inflation expectations have risen moderately to 2.5%, 2.4%, and 2.3% at the one-, three-, and five-year horizons, respectively, according to the Tankan Survey. Given inflation and wage developments, monetary accommodation should continue to be withdrawn gradually, with the policy rate projected to reach 1¼ per cent during the latter half of 2026. High uncertainty calls for close monitoring and a data-driven pace to monetary policy normalisation. The underlying primary deficit is projected to decrease from 1.5% of GDP in 2024 to 0.6% in 2026, assuming no supplementary budgets in FY2025 and FY2026, helped by fiscal consolidation in both years. OECD projections assume an increase in public investment to mitigate the impact of future disasters by 0.2% of GDP in FY2026, and additional expenditures on high school tuition assistance by 0.1% of GDP and defence spending by 0.2% of GDP in FY2025-2026. On the other hand, the corporate tax rate will be increased by 4 percentage points in April 2026 to partly finance increased defence spending. Subsidies for electricity and city gas bills will be resumed between July and September 2025. Given lower oil prices, the projections assume that the gasoline price subsidy will be phased out at the end of 2025. The gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 227% in 2023 to 213% in 2026, as nominal growth surpasses debt servicing costs. Domestic demand will drive growth but faces significant risks Real GDP is projected to grow by 0.7% and 0.4% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, driven by domestic demand. Strong wage growth will support private consumption. Despite headwinds from uncertainty, business investment is projected to remain robust in 2025, reflecting high corporate profits, a large order backlog in machinery and government subsidies. Higher trade restrictions, weaker global demand and elevated uncertainty about trading partner trade policies will weigh on exports, moderating growth. Headline consumer price inflation is projected to edge up to 2.8% in 2025, before converging to the 2% target in 2026 as food inflation slows. Risks are tilted to the downside. Weaker-than-expected external demand and abrupt changes in financial markets would lower growth. A large and rapid appreciation of the yen could reduce corporate profits and wage increases, leading to lower-than-projected private consumption and investment. Abrupt changes in bond and equity prices could destabilise financial markets and hurt the balance sheets of private financial institutions, the government, and the public pension funds. Interest rates on long-dated Japanese government bonds have already surged to record highs in May. A loss of confidence in Japan’s fiscal sustainability and an increase in the sovereign risk premium could also adversely affect the financial sector and the real economy. The main upside risk is higher-than-projected exports due to a rapid reconstruction  197 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 of international supply chains, the establishment of new export channels or an agreement with the United States on tariffs. Rebuilding fiscal buffers and boosting potential growth are priorities A higher interest bill and expenditure pressures related to spending on health and long-term care for an ageing population will exacerbate medium-term fiscal sustainability challenges. A medium-term fiscal consolidation path needs to be spelled out and adhered to, underpinned by concrete revenue and expenditure measures. Supplementary budgets should only be used in the event of large shocks. Additional potential support against the high cost-of-living or tariffs could derail fiscal consolidation and, if implemented, should be targeted and temporary. Misallocation of capital and labour and population ageing have weighed on investment and total factor productivity growth during the past decade. Reforms to improve the innovation framework and incentives for start-ups, such as redesigning the R&D tax credit and strengthening the links between universities and SMEs, would boost productivity growth and investment in new technologies and digitalisation. Investing in labour-saving and labour-augmenting technologies, as well as re-skilling and upskilling to address changing skill needs, are also key. Higher labour mobility can also boost knowledge transfer and productivity growth. Reforms to boost the labour supply of older, female, and migrant workers should also be continued to address demographic headwinds. 198  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Korea GDP growth is projected to weaken to 1.0% in 2025 before picking up to 2.2% in 2026. Increased tariffs and uncertainty are set to hold back export growth and weaken business investment. Private consumption should pick up from late 2025 as domestic political uncertainty subsides and real wages continue to rise. Inflation will remain close to target. Increased female and elderly labour market participation will raise employment, and unemployment is set to edge down in 2026. The Bank of Korea cut the policy rate to 2.75% in February and is expected to lower it further to 2.0% in 2025 amid weak demand. The partial reversal of large revenue shortfalls in 2023 and 2024 will contribute to the planned fiscal consolidation in 2025. Any additional fiscal support should be complemented by a sustainable long-term fiscal framework. Labour market reform can boost growth, reduce elderly poverty and lessen the high opportunity cost of motherhood. Confidence is tested by an uncertain environment The martial law declaration on 3 December 2024 dealt a blow to already weak domestic demand. Consumer and business confidence have been subpar. GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2025, largely driven by temporary factors holding back business and housing investment. Confidence will be boosted by the resolution of the presidential impeachment case, but uncertainty related to tariffs and international trade pulls in the opposite direction. Employment bottomed out in late 2024, and unemployment is falling back from a recent peak. Retail sales volumes have fallen in early 2025. Housing prices and construction orders have been sliding. Recent inflation readings are largely in line with the 2% target, with headline inflation at 2.1% and core inflation at 2.4% in April. Korea 1. Quarterly averages.

The Government will pursue negotiations and is not expected to respond by raising tariffs on the United States in the near term. Customs exports flatlined in the first quarter of 2025, contrary to expectations of an increase driven by front-loading ahead of the imposition of tariffs. Monetary policy is easing while the fiscal stance remains restrictive The Bank of Korea cut the policy rate to 2.75% in February, keeping the stance slightly restrictive. Further cuts totalling 75 basis points are expected in the course of 2025 to boost domestic demand and counteract the drag on growth from increased tariffs and uncertainty. Thereafter, the policy rate is assumed to remain at 2% until the end of 2026. A supplementary spending package of 0.1% of GDP has been legislated, with spending expected to be front-loaded in the second quarter. Fiscal policy is assumed to be restrictive, with consolidation of 1.1% of GDP over 2025-26, notably due to a partial reversal of the weak corporate income tax receipts over the past two years. Tariffs and uncertainty hold back growth GDP is set to grow by 1.0% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. Household consumption will gather strength gradually, supported by rising real incomes and improving labour market conditions. Business and housing investments are set to bounce back from the second quarter of 2025. Inflation is on course to remain around the 2% target.

Fiscal support may also be appropriate in the short term, but public debt has increased rapidly over the past few years, while reducing budget deficits according to plans has proved difficult. The agreement between the government and opposition on additional spending should therefore be followed by a bipartisan commitment to placing the public finances on a sustainable path going forward. Lowering barriers to trade and foreign direct investment, combined with growth-friendly fiscal measures such as environmental taxes, increased auctioning in the emissions trading scheme and streamlining of state support to companies could strengthen investment. Reforming the labour market to reduce duality, move decisively from seniority-based to performance-based wage setting and systematically enforce legislation against discrimination, can boost growth, lower elderly poverty and lessen the high opportunity cost of motherhood.  201 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Latvia Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. High inflation and rising geopolitical uncertainty are bearing down on the recovery of private consumption and investment. Increasing public investment will gradually strengthen domestic demand, while export demand is weakened by rising global trade barriers. Core inflation will remain high due to strong wage growth related to labour shortages. Further delays in the absorption of EU funds could adversely affect the recovery in domestic demand. Increasing revenue and reallocating spending to finance the strengthening of defence capacity are key to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. Improved capacity for infrastructure planning and policy impact evaluation would help increase spending efficiency. Listing large state-owned enterprises could help deepen capital markets and improve access to finance for firms. Reducing the labour tax wedge for low-income earners and shifting the tax burden towards other income, property and environmental taxes would help lower informality. Strengthening competition enforcement and addressing skills shortages by improving training opportunities and facilitating skilled immigration would support business dynamism, innovation and investment. Weak confidence and slow absorption of EU funds have weighed on growth GDP has stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2024. Private consumption fell due to low confidence and a surge in food price inflation, despite strong wage growth in the fourth quarter. Slow absorption of EU funds has weighed on public and private investment, despite easing financing conditions. Industrial production fell by 2% in March compared to February and was about 2½ per cent lower than a year earlier. Annual inflation rose from 3.5% in March to 4% in April due to rising food prices, and core inflation increased to 4.2%, reflecting strong wage growth and high services price inflation. The unemployment rate was 6.7% in March, and the vacancy rate was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting increased shortages of technicians, professionals and managers. Declining relative import prices and an increase in demand for defence equipment contributed to import volumes, which increased by 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter. Exports increased by 2.2% over the quarter, particularly driven by IT and business services. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed in the first quarter of 2025 but widened in March due to a rapid rise in import values. Although less than 3% of goods and services exports go to the United States, tariff increases could hurt exports in industries such as wood, wood products and electronics. Mortgage rates have fallen about 190 basis points from a year ago, supported by euro area monetary easing and recent reforms to strengthen competition in financial markets that reduced refinancing costs. 202  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Latvia Note: Core inflation refers to the harmonised index of consumer prices excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco.

EU Recovery and Resilience Facility grants will finance public investment and measures to improve training and digital adoption in small businesses, with average yearly spending of about 1.7% of GDP in 2025-26. Spending on internal security and defence will increase by 0.5% of GDP in 2025 and by an additional 0.9% of GDP in 2026. Legislated expenditures in social protection and public services, and interest expenses add to spending pressures. A tax on undistributed profits of credit institutions, the transfer of 1 percentage point of gross wages from the mandatory asset-backed private pension pillar to the solidarity-based public pension pillar, and rising excise taxes will partly finance the increased spending in 2025-26. There are also plans to transfer some public administrative functions to the private sector but it remains uncertain if these measures will effectively expand fiscal space. Economic activity will gradually recover, driven by domestic demand Real GDP growth will rebound to 1.1% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Private consumption will recover gradually, accelerating in 2026 as confidence improves. Public consumption will further increase due to rising spending on defence and public services. Trade policy uncertainty will weigh on exports and business investment. Tight labour markets and planned increases in minimum wages will support wage growth and lead to sticky core inflation. However, a cap on public sector wage growth will moderate wage increases. Delays in the absorption of EU funds due to skilled labour shortages, rising costs and weak capacity in infrastructure planning could weigh on domestic demand. On the upside, a stronger-than\u0002expected impact of fiscal expansion in Germany on euro area growth would raise export demand. Strengthening competition and addressing skills shortages will support business dynamism, innovation and investment Reducing high credit costs calls for lowering switching costs for loans to businesses and strengthening competition enforcement. Listing large state-owned enterprises would help improve their governance and attract investors. Strengthening the powers of the Competition Council to conduct market investigations and enforce competitive neutrality of state-owned enterprises would foster business dynamism, innovation and investment. Reducing social security contributions for low-income earners, raising progressivity of personal income taxes and stepping up enforcement efforts would help reduce informality. This also requires raising trust in institutions and continuing the fight against corruption, for example by applying the heavy fines for tax evasion and bribery that current legislation allows, while ensuring that they are proportionate. Lowering occupation-specific restrictions and facilitating administrative procedures for migrants can help to reduce skilled labour shortages, while investing more in childcare facilities would increase the labour supply of women. Establishing a tri-partite training fund and improving cooperation in training design and implementation among firms and training providers is also key. 204  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Lithuania GDP is projected to grow by 2.7% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after 2.8% in 2024. Strong real wage gains will continue supporting private consumption, especially in 2025. After a decline in 2024, investment is expected to increase progressively, supported by improved financial conditions and higher capacity utilisation but hampered by trade policy uncertainty. Despite a negative carry-over in 2025, exports are expected to increase moderately, but economic activity in the euro area is a key risk for Lithuania, along with global energy prices and geopolitical tensions. The fiscal stance is expected to loosen over 2025-26. Nevertheless, creating additional fiscal space will be key to financing rising ageing-related spending as well as defence spending. Moreover, deepening capital markets will be essential for alleviating the financial constraints that many firms are facing, and supporting investment and productivity growth. Further strengthening the public integrity framework would also support investor confidence. Economic activity has continued to strengthen GDP increased by 2.8% in 2024 as a whole and by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025, largely supported by strong real wage growth and private consumption. Nevertheless, investment declined amid low capacity utilisation and subdued business confidence, especially in services. Consumer confidence remains high but has been declining since the end of 2024. Headline inflation bottomed out in October 2024 and reached 3.6% in April 2025, amid higher food and energy prices. While immigration helped to alleviate some labour shortages, the labour market is tight, with vacancies at a high level and contributing to strong wage growth. Unemployment, at 6.4% in March 2025, is below its long-term average. Lithuania 1. Harmonised index of consumer prices excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco. 2. Total economy.

Higher US tariffs on EU goods will thus indirectly weigh on Lithuania through reduced activity in the European Union, which accounts for 60% of total Lithuanian exports. Fiscal policy is becoming more accommodative Financing conditions, measured by long-term interest rates, have improved compared to a year ago and are expected to stabilise, as the spread vis-à-vis German benchmarks settles around 0.7 percentage points, down from 2.2 percentage points when inflation peaked. The fiscal deficit is expected to increase further from 1.3% in 2024 to 3.0% in 2025 and 2026. The main factors contributing to a higher headline deficit in 2025-26 than in 2024 are related to pension benefits and public wages. The State Defence Council, comprising Lithuania’s political and military leaders, recently agreed to raise defence spending to 5-6% of GDP annually over 2026-30, up from 3% in 2025. While Parliament still needs to approve this plan and clarify financing, and budget cuts are envisaged in non-defence ministries, the increase in defence spending may raise the 2026 fiscal deficit beyond the current projection. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Lithuania Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 56.7 2.5 0.3 2.8 2.7 2.4 Private consumption 31.9 2.0 -0.3 3.5 4.9 4.0 Government consumption 9.9 1.2 -0.2 1.4 1.0 0.8 Gross fixed capital formation 12.7 5.2 9.3 -1.3 4.9 4.6 Final domestic demand 54.5 2.6 1.9 2.0 4.2 3.5 Stockbuilding¹ - 0.4 -0.3 -3.3 1.0 1.6 0.0 Total domestic demand 54.2 2.9 -0.9 3.1 6.1 3.5 Exports of goods and services 45.1 12.4 -3.4 2.1 1.1 2.6 Imports of goods and services 42.6 12.7 -5.3 2.4 5.1 4.2 Net exports¹ 2.5 0.3 1.8 -0.2 -2.7 -1.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 16.1 9.0 3.4 4.7 3.2 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 18.9 8.7 0.9 4.0 2.5 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 10.5 9.6 3.2 2.9 2.4 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 6.0 6.8 7.1 6.3 5.8 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 0.9 3.0 7.9 7.4 6.8 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -0.7 -0.7 -1.3 -3.0 -3.0 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 37.7 38.5 40.3 43.3 44.0 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 38.1 37.3 38.2 41.4 42.1 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -6.0 1.1 3.0 3.3 2.1 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) 1.

Sustained real wage gains and a lower saving rate will continue supporting private consumption, especially in 2025. Investment is expected to rebound progressively. While lower long-term interest rates and higher capacity utilisation will support investment, trade policy uncertainty is likely to hamper it. Exports are projected to pick up but will remain closely connected to external demand from Lithuania’s main trading partners. Economic activity in the euro area is thus a key risk for Lithuania, along with global energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Structural reforms would improve fiscal sustainability and support investment Lithuania will face a major demographic shock that will increase pension-related costs, with high old-age poverty and low life expectancy for men making it difficult to contain these pressures. In this context, creating additional fiscal space will be needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. This will require improving the efficiency of public spending, increasing tax revenues and encouraging formal economic activity. Strengthening productivity growth will sustain living standards despite population ageing. While Lithuania’s product market regulations and insolvency framework are among the most conducive to productivity growth in the OECD, many firms are facing financial constraints. The development of capital markets would support productivity growth by facilitating investment in intangibles, research and development, and technological innovation. This requires increasing the supply and demand of non-bank capital, including by mobilising institutional investors such as pension funds, leveraging digital financing, and listing a wider range of state-owned enterprises. Further strengthening the public integrity framework, including by systematically monitoring the post-public employment activities of high-ranking public officials and reinforcing leadership support for integrity measures in public institutions, would also limit perceived corruption and support investor confidence.  207 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Luxembourg GDP is projected to grow by 2.1% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026, following a strong rebound in activity in the final quarter of 2024. Private consumption will remain robust as real wage growth, bolstered by receding inflation and rising wage rates, supports households’ real disposable income. Lower interest rates will provide stimulus to the financial and construction sectors. Risks are broadly balanced. Construction and finance may recover faster than expected. Weaker activity in the euro area and increasing barriers to trade could dampen the recovery. Fiscal policy should remain prudent through the full phasing-out of energy policy supports. A comprehensive pension reform, to raise contributions, increase the effective retirement age and adjust benefits, is needed to ensure sustainability for future generations. Rising capacity constraints imply the need to transition from a growth model based on rapid labour force growth to one based on innovation and skills, while maintaining public investment in transport and climate mitigation actions. Housing affordability should be tackled through reforms aimed at relaxing structural barriers to developing supply. Economic activity recovered strongly in the final quarter of 2024 Industrial production and construction activity rose slightly through 2024. Lower interest rates fuelled the recovery of the financial sector and of housing transactions in the last quarter of 2024. High-frequency indicators and the decline in new loans for house purchases suggest a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025. Business confidence indicators in most non-financial services have recovered since the sharp fall in 2024Q3 but remain below historical averages. While labour shortages persist, they have significantly eased from the post-pandemic peak. Wage indexation supported households’ purchasing power and private consumption through 2024, despite weak consumer sentiment. In the year to April 2025, despite the partial lifting of energy price supports and some increase in food and energy prices, headline inflation fell to 1.7% (down from 3.2% in April 2024) and core inflation to 2.1%.

However, indirect effects through weaker demand from European partners, including automotive components from Germany, are expected. Furthermore, lower equity prices and weaker household income growth in Europe may slow activity in the financial sector. Fiscal policy will remain prudent The government budget recorded a small surplus in 2024, mostly thanks to higher revenues from direct business taxes and lower current outlays. Despite the scaling back of energy policy support, the budget balance is projected to return to a small deficit in 2025 and 2026 due to increasing defence expenditures, which should reach 2% of GDP by 2030, up from 1.3% in 2024. Overall, the fiscal stance is projected to ease by 1.7% of GDP over 2025 and 2026. The recovery in activity is expected to continue Growth is projected to strengthen gradually over 2025 and 2026, as easing financial conditions bolster the financial and construction sectors. Despite increased global uncertainty, domestic consumption will be resilient, due to the scheduled wage indexation in 2025Q2 supporting real incomes, and to a modest draw\u0002down of household savings towards their long-term average rate.

Amid global uncertainty and growing barriers to trade, the contribution of exports to GDP will remain modest. Risks are broadly balanced, with a faster than-expected recovery in finance and construction representing the main upside risk. The main downside risks include a slowdown of economic activity in the euro area, potential financial markets disruptions, and a contraction of exports linked to tariffs. Structural reforms are necessary to boost productivity growth and ensure fiscal and environmental sustainability To safeguard fiscal sustainability, a comprehensive pension reform is needed to raise contributions, increase the effective retirement age and contain expenditures. Productivity is high relative to the EU area average but growth is stagnant. Structural reforms are necessary to support private investment in innovation and improve the quality of life-long training, including through better coordination across the main public actors supporting R&D, and a shift from the current institution-oriented system to a project\u0002oriented one. Quality standards for training providers can be strengthened by introducing a national accreditation agency and by tightening quality controls. Despite substantial progress, further efforts to implement the national energy and climate plan and strengthen public transport are needed to meet climate targets, mitigate congestion and improve attractiveness to cross-border workers. 210  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Malaysia GDP is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. Private consumption will remain robust, supported by favourable labour market conditions. Investment growth will benefit from new opportunities in technology-intensive sectors, although global trade tensions are generating significant risks. Inflation is expected to rise amid a planned removal of fuel subsidies and potential wage pressures. Government debt has increased to 64.6% of GDP in 2024. Fiscal consolidation is needed to rebuild fiscal space, including by mobilising more revenues and phasing out energy subsidies. The neutral monetary policy stance should be maintained in the short term. Substantial gender gaps are hampering women’s economic opportunities, which could be addressed by investing more in childcare support and promoting workplace flexibility. Reducing skill mismatches could boost both growth and social inclusion. The economy has been growing steadily Real GDP grew by 5.1% in 2024, largely driven by private consumption and to a lesser extent investment. After a small contraction in late 2024, GDP growth rebounded in the first quarter of 2025, with 0.7% growth quarter-on-quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Inflation has been contained, with neither annual headline nor core inflation exceeding 2% since August 2024, despite an uptick in core inflation in early 2025. Meanwhile, the labour market has been strong as unemployment fell to 3.0% in March 2025, its lowest level since April 2015, while labour force participation rose to an all-time high of 70.7% in the same month. Exports grew strongly in 2024 and shipments to the United States, Malaysia's third largest export destination, accounted for about the half of the growth of merchandise exports. Exports to China, the country's second largest export market, declined by 2.2%. Due to strong import growth, however, net exports made only a marginal contribution to growth. These trends continued in the first three months of 2025. Tourist arrivals have now recovered to well above their 2019 levels. Exports to the United States accounted for 13.2% of merchandise exports and 10.3% of GDP in 2024, and a 10% tariff is now being applied to merchandise imports from Malaysia, although there some exemptions for particular products.  211 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Malaysia Source: CEIC.

The lower deficit will help bring down government debt, which has increased rapidly from 52.4% of GDP in 2019 to 64.6% in 2024 and create fiscal space to address rising long-term spending pressures related to social protection and climate change. The central bank has maintained the policy rate at 3% since July 2023, which is a broadly neutral monetary policy stance. This stance is expected to continue, although the central bank should remain vigilant in the face of emerging inflationary pressures from the continued withdrawal of fuel subsidies, increases in the minimum wage and civil servants’ salaries, and tight labour market. The economy will grow moderately, but faces significant downside risks Output is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026. Private consumption will be buoyed by favourable labour market conditions, although the withdrawal of fuel subsidies will weigh on the real purchasing power of some households. Private investment will be supported by new opportunities in technology-intensive sectors. Infrastructure projects and investments by public corporations will support public investment. Inflation is projected to rise slightly to 2.2% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026, reflecting progress in fuel subsidy withdrawal. Export growth will be affected by global trade tensions and high levels of uncertainty, which could have more negative effects than currently assumed, particularly if tariff rates rise further. On the domestic front, stronger than expected inflationary pressures remain a downside risk. Structural reforms can reduce inequalities and make growth more sustainable Improving the targeting of social protection while raising social assistance coverage and benefit levels would allow stronger reductions of poverty and inequality. Policies to bridge the gender gap, including improving access to affordable childcare and extending paid maternity and paternity leave periods, would allow more women to participate in the labour market and find jobs that match their skills. Measures to reduce skill mismatches, such as expanding the skills registry and investing more into adult education, could boost both growth and social inclusion. Addressing climate change requires accelerating the planned withdrawal of energy subsidies and a stronger role for carbon pricing, complemented by stricter regulations and additional investments. A “National Policy on Climate Change 2.0” was announced in September 2024 and contains ambitious measures in this direction, which should be implemented without unnecessary delays. Private investment could benefit from a more even playing field between private and government\u0002linked enterprises.  213 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Mexico The economy is projected to grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. Low unemployment and easing inflation will support consumption. Public consumption and investment will remain subdued, given ongoing fiscal consolidation. Exports will be dampened by tariffs, uncertainty and weaker global growth. Investment will be supported by declining interest rates but is expected to recover only gradually, reflecting high uncertainty. Implementing a medium-term fiscal plan could help reduce the deficit gradually, creating room for investments that boost productivity, such as education. To ensure that inflation continues to decrease towards target, the central bank should continue its prudent and gradual easing cycle. Expanding dual vocational programmes would enhance technical skills availability, boosting competitiveness and facilitating access to formal jobs. Agriculture has recovered but investment is slowing Short-term indicators point to a partial improvement in economic activity during the first quarter of 2025, with GDP growing by 0.2% (quarter on quarter), after the 0.6% contraction in the previous quarter. The improvement was driven entirely by a rebound in the agriculture sector, following weather related disruptions at the end of 2024, while industrial production contracted and services stagnated. Non\u0002residential construction is losing momentum after the completion of major infrastructure projects in the South, while investment in machinery and equipment is also easing amid high uncertainty. Private consumption has slowed, in line with slowing formal job creation. Exports remain subdued, constrained by persistent trade-related uncertainty. Unemployment, at 2.6% in March, remains at historically low levels, although participation has recently declined. Inflationary pressures are easing, although headline and core inflation rose to 3.9% (year-on-year) in April, driven by volatility in some food prices and seasonal variations in tourism-related services.

As a result, Mexico is particularly impacted by rising trade restrictions and ongoing uncertainty. The projections assume that Mexico’s exports to the United States that are compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) face a 0% tariff, while non-compliant exports face a 25% tariff, both in 2025 and 2026. Around 50% of Mexico’s exports to the United States are currently compliant. Compliance is assumed to gradually rise towards 75% in 2026 by following the necessary steps, such as completing certifications of origin. Automobiles and automobile parts are assumed to be subject to a 25% tariff rate in 2025 and 2026, with the share of United States content excluded from this tariff. The projections also assume a 25% tariff on United States imports of steel and aluminium products from Mexico. Monetary policy easing and fiscal consolidation should be gradual The central bank has continued its monetary easing cycle, lowering the policy rate to 8.5% in May. Easing inflationary pressures, weakening economic activity and well-anchored inflation expectations support a further gradual, data-dependant reduction in the policy rate to 7% by the end of 2025, with additional cuts in 2026. After widening to 4.9% of GDP in 2024, the highest level in 35 years, the budget deficit is expected to fall to 3.5% in 2025, primarily through cuts in public investment, and to 3% in 2026. By the end of 2026, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be around 52% of GDP. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Mexico Current prices MXN billion GDP at market prices 26 690.0 3.7 3.3 1.5 0.4 1.1 Private consumption 18 236.2 4.8 4.2 2.8 0.5 1.8 Government consumption 3 043.9 2.0 1.8 1.6 0.2 0.3 Gross fixed capital formation 5 687.6 7.5 16.6 3.3 -0.9 1.5 Final domestic demand 26 967.7 5.1 6.6 2.8 0.1 1.6 Stockbuilding¹ 237.7 0.0 -0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 27 205.4 5.0 6.2 2.8 0.2 1.6 Exports of goods and services 10 827.9 9.5 -7.2 3.3 6.8 1.1 Imports of goods and services 11 343.3 8.6 3.7 2.7 3.1 2.4 Net exports¹ - 515.4 0.2 -4.7 0.1 1.2 -0.7 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.6 4.5 4.9 4.4 3.3 Consumer price index _ 7.9 5.5 4.7 3.4 3.2 Core inflation index² _ 7.6 6.7 4.1 3.6 3.2 Unemployment rate³ (% of labour force) _ 3.3 2.8 2.7 2.8 2.8 Government financial balance⁴ (% of GDP) _ -3.2 -3.4 -4.9 -3.5 -3.0 Government gross debt⁴ (% of GDP) _ 48.2 47.4 50.6 51.8 52.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -1.5 -0.3 -0.1 -0.2 -0.4 Percentage changes, volume (2018 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Private consumption will be supported by low unemployment and declining inflation. Private investment will gradually benefit from lower interest rates, though it will remain constrained by high domestic and global uncertainty. Public investment is set to stay subdued as part of efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit. Quarterly export growth will be dampened by trade tariffs and high global uncertainty. Both headline and core inflation will continue to fall gradually. However, the outlook for both growth and inflation remain uncertain. Given Mexico’s high exposure to the US market, the projected US slowdown in 2025-26 and tighter financial conditions may weigh further on external and investment demand. Moreover, increased global risk aversion and exchange rate volatility could raise sovereign borrowing costs and further limit fiscal space. On the upside, a reduction in uncertainty, such as through a swift and successful renegotiation of the trade agreement with the United States and Canada, could support investment and exports more strongly than currently anticipated. Boosting productivity and adapting to climate change are priorities Enhancing immovable property tax collection and improving tax administration, including through digitalisation, could help increase tax revenues and create fiscal space for additional spending in productivity-enhancing areas, such as education or digitalisation. Systematically applying cost-benefit analysis would enhance the efficiency of public spending. A comprehensive early childhood education and care system would facilitate women’s labour market participation. Encouraging private investment in renewable energy through supportive regulations could help turn Mexico's abundant renewable resources into a competitive advantage. Improving water management would strengthen Mexico’s adaptation to climate change, reduce operational risks and help to attract investment. 216  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Netherlands GDP is set to grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026, driven by strengthening private consumption on the back of rising disposable household income, and government investment. Private investment will also improve, supported by gradually declining interest rates, but will be dampened by global uncertainty. However, external demand will weaken due to higher tariffs and trade uncertainty. Annual headline inflation is set to fall only slowly to 2.9% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, as service price pressures persist. Unemployment will increase marginally from 3.7% in 2024 to 4% in 2026, as the bankruptcy rate rises to pre-pandemic levels. The fiscal stance will be expansionary over 2025-26 due to higher spending on health care, housing and defence, as well as cuts in personal, corporate and environmental taxes. In the short term, fiscal measures are projected to support economic growth but worsen the fiscal balance, with the government deficit projected to widen from 0.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2026. The government should prioritise investments supporting the green transition and productivity, including enhancing digital skills and increasing the adoption of digital technologies. The economy remains resilient In the first quarter of 2025, GDP growth slowed to 0.1% quarter-on-quarter, down from 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Weaker household spending and fixed asset investment weighed on the economy, partly offset by higher public consumption and a smaller reduction in inventories. Headline inflation picked up to 4.1% in April, from 3.4% in the previous quarter, reflecting higher food and service prices. Annual wage growth under collective labour agreements moderated, falling to 5.5% from 6.6% the quarter before. The labour market remained tight, with job vacancies continuing to outnumber unemployed persons, and the unemployment rate stable at 3.8% in April. Consumer confidence continued to decline between January and April. Business sentiment also remained below its long-term average, declining again in April after a modest rebound earlier in 2025.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/khw8uc  217 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Netherlands: Demand, output and prices StatLink 2https://stat.link/8kb5gl As a trade-dependent economy, the Netherlands is exposed to global trade developments. About 5.7% of goods exports are destined for the United States. However, the most important exports include semiconductor machines and pharmaceuticals, which have so far been exempt from the increase in US import tariffs on EU goods. Indirectly, both through its strong integration in global value chains and as a logistic hub for EU trade, the Dutch economy will be affected via the slowdown in global trade. Fiscal policy is expansionary The fiscal stance will be expansionary over 2025-26, with fiscal easing projected to be around 1.4% of potential GDP, supporting short-term economic growth but worsening the government’s fiscal balance. The budget deficit is projected to widen from 0.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2026, in line with government plans for higher spending on health care, housing and defence. These spending increases are partially offset by spending cuts in education, public services and development aid. In 2026, the transfer of military pensions to the Dutch civil service pension fund (ABP) will weigh additionally on the fiscal balance. The government support of low- and middle-income household purchasing power through the introduction of a new reduced tax bracket in income taxation took effect at the beginning of 2025 and will reduce revenues over the projection period. Overall, the debt ratio is expected to rise from the historically low level of 43.3% of GDP in 2024 to 46.8% in 2026. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Netherlands Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 891.3 5.0 0.1 1.0 1.3 1.1 Private consumption 380.4 6.9 0.8 1.0 1.5 1.6 Government consumption 226.1 1.3 2.9 3.6 2.4 1.7 Gross fixed capital formation 184.6 3.4 1.2 -0.5 0.4 1.3 Final domestic demand 791.1 4.5 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.6 Stockbuilding¹ 13.6 0.5 -2.3 -0.4 0.3 0.0 Total domestic demand 804.7 5.0 -0.9 1.0 1.9 1.6 Exports of goods and services 769.3 4.5 -0.4 0.1 0.3 1.1 Imports of goods and services 682.7 4.4 -1.7 0.0 0.7 1.6 Net exports¹ 86.6 0.5 1.1 0.1 -0.3 -0.3 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 7.3 5.2 3.3 2.6 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 11.6 4.1 3.2 2.9 2.5 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 4.8 6.4 3.2 2.6 2.6 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.5 3.5 3.7 3.9 4.0 Household saving ratio, net3 (% of disposable income) _ 7.1 7.5 9.4 9.7 8.8 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 0.0 -0.4 -0.9 -2.3 -2.8 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 52.7 49.8 47.5 48.3 50.0 General government debt, Maastricht definition⁴ (% of GDP) _ 48.4 45.2 43.3 44.7 46.8 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 6.6 9.9 9.9 9.3 9.1 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Private consumption will be a key driver, buttressed by a boost in real income as wages continue growing above inflation, though weak consumer confidence may temper the pace of recovery. Investment will recover, supported by gradually declining interest rates and public spending, though uncertainty, tight financial conditions and supply constraints could weigh on the momentum. External demand is expected to remain subdued, reflecting ongoing trade fragmentation, tariff uncertainty and weakening global growth. Annual headline inflation is set to fall only slowly to 2.9% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, and core inflation is expected to remain sticky slowing to 2.6% in 2026, with rising labour costs continuing to exert upward pressure on services prices. Bankruptcy rates will rise, but lead only to a marginal increase in unemployment from 3.7% in 2024 to 4% in 2026, as the labour market remains tight. The economic outlook is surrounded by significant downside risks, primarily related to rising geopolitical tensions and trade fragmentation. Domestically, labour market tightness remains a key concern. Continued wage growth could maintain price pressures, especially if euro area policy rates are lowered while inflation remains elevated in the Netherlands. While this could erode price competitiveness, weaken purchasing power, and slow private consumption, it could also help to alleviate labour market tightness. Furthermore, trade diversion could lead to lower import prices thereby creating downward pressure on inflation. Enhancing tax efficiency would support growth The Netherlands’ strong fiscal position provides room for a moderately expansionary stance, though rising population ageing and significant investment needs for the green transition will test medium-term fiscal sustainability. To increase the share of renewables in the energy mix, the government needs to support investment in the electricity grid. Long-standing structural challenges also need to be addressed, focussing on easing labour market pressures and supporting productivity growth. Simplifying the tax and benefits system and removing distortions favouring owner-occupied housing could increase productivity-enhancing investment and ease tensions in the labour market. Enhancing digital skills and increasing the adoption of digital technologies particularly among smaller enterprises could further boost productivity growth and maintain competitiveness.  219 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 New Zealand Following the deepest recession since 1991, economic activity began to recover in late 2024. The expansion is expected to continue with growth projected to rise to 0.8% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 supported by lower interest rates. However, increased trade restrictions and high uncertainty about trade policy globally will temper external demand, confidence and the pace of the recovery. Inflation is set to fall further due to lower oil prices and higher spare capacity including in the labour market. The unemployment rate is expected to peak in late 2025 at around 5.4%. With core inflation declining, and inflation expectations well anchored, the central bank should steadily reduce the official cash rate to the neutral rate of around 3% and reduce it further if the recovery falters. The pace of fiscal consolidation is appropriate but may need to be slowed if the expansion stalls. Trend growth will remain modest without energy, innovation, investment and skills reforms to lift lacklustre productivity. A recovery is underway Rebalancing of the economy following a severe episode of post-pandemic overheating is well advanced. Headline inflation has declined towards the midpoint of the central bank’s 1 to 3% target range and core inflation is also declining, albeit more gradually. The economy started to recover in late 2024. The rebound was narrowly based on exports, public consumption and stock building. Private consumption and investment growth remained subdued and consumer confidence fell sharply in early 2025. Indicators for the construction sector are showing signs of bottoming out. Net inwards migration has fallen from a peak of 135 000 per annum (2.6% of the population), to a more sustainable level of around 30 000. Commodity export volumes and prices grew strongly in late 2024 and early 2025, Tourism growth has been buoyant, with arrivals rising to 85% of their pre-pandemic level in 2024, but showed signs of weakening in early2025.

The direct effects of higher trade restrictions are likely to be mainly via weaker export prices rather than lower volumes as in the short run agricultural export volumes are supply driven and New Zealand is a price taker in the United States market. In addition, New Zealand’s export prices are expected to come under pressure from greater competition in markets outside the United States. Weaker external demand is also projected to eventually slow export volume growth, weighing on the expansion. The projections assume no trade policy retaliation by New Zealand. As a result, effects on inflation are assumed to be only indirect, via higher costs in global production chains, as well as cheaper imports other countries that are attempting to sell exports no longer bound for the United States elsewhere. Monetary policy is expected to loosen further while budget consolidation continues With inflation falling and inside the target range the central bank cut the official cash rate by 200 basis points to 3.5% between August 2024 and April 2025. It is assumed to cut the official rate to a neutral level of around 3% during 2025 and should reduce it further if the expansion falters. Public debt has risen significantly, and the budget is coming under pressure from rising pension expenditure and faces growing defence spending needs. The 2025 Budget continues the programme of reducing expenditure as a share of GDP. It also took an important step to address the economy’s low capital intensity by introducing the “Investment Boost”, which allows firms to immediately deduct 20% of the value of a new asset from their taxable income on top of normal depreciation. Provided the expansion continues, the government should continue to fully pursue its programme to reduce expenditure as a share of GDP. This is expected to increase the structural fiscal balance by 1.2% of GDP and 0.2% of GDP in 2025 and 2026 respectively. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 New Zealand Current prices NZD billion GDP at market prices 359.1 3.2 1.9 -0.1 0.8 1.7 Private consumption 202.9 4.2 1.0 0.2 0.3 1.8 Government consumption 73.4 5.2 0.8 0.0 0.3 0.3 Gross fixed capital formation 85.7 4.2 -0.1 -4.6 -1.0 2.7 Final domestic demand 362.0 4.4 0.7 -1.0 0.0 1.7 Stockbuilding¹ 8.7 0.2 -1.7 0.2 0.2 0.0 Total domestic demand 370.7 4.4 -0.9 -0.8 0.2 1.7 Exports of goods and services 77.7 -0.8 11.4 4.2 4.0 1.5 Imports of goods and services 89.4 4.6 -0.6 2.4 1.3 1.4 Net exports¹ - 11.7 -1.3 2.8 0.3 0.6 0.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 3.6 3.6 2.6 1.9 Consumer price index _ 7.2 5.7 2.9 2.4 2.1 Core inflation index2 _ 6.0 5.6 3.5 2.5 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.3 3.7 4.7 5.3 5.2 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ -3.0 -8.5 -7.8 -6.8 -6.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -2.6 -2.1 -1.8 -1.2 -1.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 51.2 54.4 57.0 57.8 58.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -8.8 -6.9 -6.1 -5.0 -4.8 Percentage changes, volume (2009/2010 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

However, escalating trade restrictions, weakening external demand and high trade policy uncertainty are hitting confidence and are set to hold back the recovery. High and rising prices for electricity hedges are contributing to industrial closures and are expected to restrain investment. The unemployment rate is set to peak at around 5.4% in late 2025 before gradually declining as employment growth picks up. Headline inflation is projected to fall to 2.5% in 2025 due to the decline in oil prices. Core inflation is projected to continue falling slowly. A large increase in tariffs on New Zealand exports, or low rainfall that reduces hydroelectricity generation and raises electricity prices would slow growth. However, a faster recovery of investment may occur as the “Investment Boost”, and other reforms to accelerate FDI and infrastructure construction, take hold. Increasing trade and investment linkages is key for sustaining the expansion An increasingly febrile and fractured geoeconomic environment means New Zealand will need to work harder working with like-minded countries to expand trade and encourage foreign direct investment. This is crucial for boosting investment and management skills required to address the chronically low capital\u0002to-labour ratio and poor productivity growth. As well as maintaining low trade policy barriers and further expanding free trade agreements, the government should continue efforts to attract more foreign investment via more streamlined government support and lowering high restrictions. Competition and energy related reforms are required to improve the reliability and affordability of electricity. This is a prerequisite for more investment in digitalisation and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. 222  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Norway Mainland GDP is projected to increase by 1.7% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. Solid household disposable income growth will boost private consumption. Housing investment will rebound from a slump as interest rates decline. Non-oil business investment will strengthen only slightly due to heightened uncertainty. Oil production is expected to decline markedly. Strong domestic cost pressures, currently pushing up inflation, are expected to subside gradually. The central bank is expected to start cutting the policy rate around mid-2025, as inflation eases. Fiscal policy is set to remain expansionary in 2025-26, worsening the structural non-oil budget balance further. Easing product market regulations and insolvency regimes would spur private investment and productivity, fostering stronger self-driven economic growth. Mainland activity has shown signs of recovery Mainland GDP growth picked up in the first quarter of 2025. Household consumption, which had remained somewhat subdued due to high inflation and high interest rates, grew strongly on the back of solid real wage gains. Housing investment declined considerably through late 2024, and remains depressed. Growth in non-oil business investment has generally remained weak. There are signs of a more broad-based recovery, as both manufacturing production and retail sales have risen in recent months. Business surveys also suggest some momentum in activity, except for construction, in the near term. Headline inflation has been volatile in recent months, largely owing to food and energy prices, and stood at 2.5% in April.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/ejk3yo  223 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Norway: Demand, output and prices StatLink 2https://stat.link/c6q4wn The United States imposed a 10% tariff on goods imported from Norway in April, which could be raised to 15% by July. The United States accounts for around 3% of Norway's total exports, so the direct impact of the increased US tariff will be relatively modest. In this projection, Norway is assumed not to introduce a retaliatory tariff and the possible rise in July is assumed not to take place. Nonetheless, Norway will be affected by increased uncertainty in the global economy and a contraction in demand, including for oil and gas. Both oil and gas prices have declined markedly since early April, reducing export and government revenue. Macroeconomic policies will be supportive The central bank has repeatedly postponed the envisaged first rate cut, amid stronger-than-expected inflationary pressures associated with strong wage growth. With inflation expectations well anchored around the 2% target, however, the monetary policy stance is set to become less restrictive starting around mid-2025, with the policy rate expected to be brought down to 3.5% by late 2026. Overall, fiscal policy is expected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026. Defence spending is to rise to 2.2% of GDP in 2025, and personal income tax and social security contributions are being cut. The Revised National Budget introduces a new electricity support package. It also considerably increases support to Ukraine, albeit with little effect on economic activity in Norway. The structural non-oil budget deficit is expected to widen by more than 2½ percentage points of mainland GDP this year, with the increased support to Ukraine largely accounting for the deviation from the initial budget. The structural non-oil deficit in 2025 is still expected to remain below the 3% of the value of the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) threshold, which has been raised significantly due to substantial increases in GPFG assets over time. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Norway Current prices NOK billion Mainland GDP at market prices1 3 315.3 4.3 0.7 0.6 1.7 1.9 GDP at market prices 4 323.9 3.2 0.1 2.1 0.3 1.6 Private consumption 1 626.3 7.8 -1.2 1.2 2.7 2.2 Government consumption 970.7 1.8 3.4 2.4 1.5 1.1 Gross fixed capital formation 992.2 0.3 -1.5 -1.9 -0.4 2.2 Final domestic demand 3 589.2 4.1 -0.2 0.7 1.6 1.9 Stockbuilding² 92.6 1.4 -0.5 -0.7 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 3 681.8 5.6 -0.8 -0.1 1.6 1.8 Exports of goods and services 1 860.9 5.2 0.4 5.7 -1.4 1.6 Imports of goods and services 1 218.8 13.3 -1.5 3.7 1.0 2.5 Net exports² 642.1 -1.5 0.7 1.5 -1.0 -0.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 28.4 -11.1 -0.2 1.7 0.4 Consumer price index _ 5.7 5.5 3.2 3.0 2.3 Core inflation index³ _ 3.6 5.8 3.5 2.9 2.5 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.3 3.6 4.0 4.1 4.0 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 4.7 4.0 7.3 7.8 7.9 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 25.5 16.5 13.2 10.0 10.3 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 42.2 51.0 62.0 60.7 59.5 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 29.0 16.6 16.9 14.6 12.5 Percentage changes, volume (2022 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Solid growth in real household disposable income, driven by strong wage growth, lower inflation and government support, will drive up private consumption. As interest rates decline, housing investment will pick up in the latter half of 2025 from currently depressed levels. Non-oil business investment will increase only moderately, reflecting heightened uncertainty in the global economy. Oil production, exports and investment are projected to weaken this year. Oil and gas prices could affect the Norwegian economy substantially in both directions. A surge in oil and gas prices would considerably boost export and government revenue. Conversely, an abrupt decline in oil and gas prices would substantially strain the budget balance, especially given the significant deterioration of the structural non-oil budget balance in recent years. Similarly, a sharp drop in the value of GPFG assets would abruptly reduce fiscal space. Public policy needs to stimulate market forces While the Norwegian economy has been bolstered by offshore activity and government spending for some time, spurring private investment and productivity is key to making growth more sustainable. Industrial subsidies have increased substantially in recent years, with too much focus on specific industries such as battery factories and offshore wind projects. The government should stop support to these, and focus instead on further reforming market regulations, notably by reducing administrative burdens and licence requirements for firm entry and alleviating penalties for business failure. This would help ensure fiscal sustainability while boosting private investment, particularly innovative ventures, via market forces.  225 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Peru GDP growth is projected to slow to 2.8% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026, with global and domestic policy uncertainty weighing on the outlook. Government spending will moderate as fiscal consolidation resumes. Private investment will remain moderate, constrained by persistent uncertainty and tighter global financial conditions. Private consumption will be supported by low inflation. Export growth will weaken reflecting the direct impact of new US tariffs on Peruvian products and the broader drag from weaker global growth. Inflation is expected to remain close to the central bank’s 2% target. The Central Bank’s broadly neutral monetary stance is appropriate and should remain cautious and data dependent. The government plans gradual consolidation in 2025 and 2026 to align the deficit with fiscal rules, but rising expenditure pressures and optimistic revenue projections make compliance challenging, requiring additional measures to meet fiscal targets. Streamlining permits, easing regulatory burdens, and strengthening subnational investment capacity can help crowd in private investment. Strong domestic demand propelled the economic recovery GDP rose by 3.3% in 2024, led by strong domestic demand and a rebound in agricultural and mining exports. Public investment rose by 14% and private consumption was supported by pension fund withdrawals. Private investment began to recover moderately, aided by improved business sentiment, looser financial conditions, and newly awarded Public-Private Partnership contracts. Historically high terms of trade supported the current account. Monthly GDP indicators show that growth remained strong in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP expanding by 3.9% year-on-year. Inflation remains well anchored within the central bank’s 1–3% target band, with headline and core inflation rising by 1.6% and 1.9% in April relative to the previous year, respectively, and expectations close to 2%. Despite a 0.8% rise in employment in 2024, real wages in the formal sector remain below 2019 levels, while high informality and weak participation persist, particularly for women and youth. Peru 1.

Copper exports, representing less than 10% of bilateral trade to the United States, remain exempt but faced an average price drop of 3% in April y-o-y. Gold, a key export commodity, saw rising prices, while the currency depreciated moderately since mid-March. Ample currency reserves and low public debt provide resilience against shocks. The fiscal deficit is set to decline, while monetary policy is expected to remain broadly neutral Fiscal consolidation is planned for 2025–2026. While high metal prices will support revenues and narrow the fiscal deficit, additional measures equivalent to 0.3% of GDP in 2025 and 0.4% of GDP in 2026 are still needed to meet fiscal targets. Peru’s fiscal deficit reached 3.5% of GDP in 2024, marking a second consecutive year with a breach of the fiscal rule despite the economic recovery. Fiscal pressures are increasing due to newly introduced tax exemptions, including those for special economic zones, an underfunded pension reform, and potential further support to the state oil company, Petroperú. A broadly neutral monetary policy remains appropriate given well-anchored inflation expectations. Following the recent cut to 4.5%, the policy rate is expected to remain unchanged in the remainder of 2025-26. GDP growth is set to moderate GDP growth will slow to 2.8% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026, while inflation is expected to stay around the 2% target.

Fiscal consolidation will limit government consumption and public investment. Given elevated uncertainty, downside risks to growth have increased, particularly through weaker investment and external demand. Domestic political uncertainty may intensify in the lead-up to the 2026 general election, while rising insecurity and crime could hinder economic growth. Lower growth in China, Peru’s major trading partner, and weaker copper prices could hurt exports, government revenues, and investment. Securing fiscal sustainability requires efficiency improvements, revenue mobilisation, and formalisation Stricter control of the public wage bill and phasing out inefficient fuel subsidies and tax expenditures would help meet the fiscal rule. Failure to do so may erode investor confidence, raise borrowing costs, and worsen the debt outlook. To safeguard fiscal sustainability amid growing demands for social and infrastructure spending, Peru must raise tax revenues and improve spending efficiency. This includes strengthening budget planning, improving public investment management and enhancing subnational implementation capacity. Addressing informality, improving the tax administration and the eliminating ineffective tax exemptions are critical for broadening the tax base. Simplifying tax regimes for small firms could boost formalisation, support SME growth and generate additional revenues. Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and introducing a carbon tax would aid both fiscal and environmental goals. In the current context of tighter global financial conditions and heightened uncertainty, restoring investor confidence is essential. Establishing a broad formalisation agenda that includes lower non-wage labour costs for low-income workers, leaner permits and regulations, stronger legal enforcement and better education and training - would raise investment, productivity and expand the tax base. 228  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Philippines Real GDP is projected to grow by 5.6% in 2025 and 6.0% in 2026. Private consumption will be bolstered by a strong labour market and low inflation, while investment is projected to pick up modestly on the back of easing financial conditions and increased public infrastructure spending. Inflation is anticipated to remain contained at 2.0% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026 amid balanced domestic demand and currency stability. Risks are broadly balanced. On the downside, a larger-than-expected slowdown in major economies, including the United States or China, could reduce demand for Philippine exports and affect remittance inflows, impacting domestic consumption and investment. On the upside, recent reforms to reduce barriers to foreign direct investment could boost investment. Monetary policy is expected to continue to ease over 2025 and 2026 to a more neutral stance. Fiscal policy is projected to be moderately restrictive in both 2025 and 2026, with a gradual reduction of the fiscal deficit from 5.7% of GDP in 2024 to 4.6% in 2026. Complementing recent pro-competition reforms with measures to streamline regulations across the economy – including in key network sectors such as energy, telecommunications and transport – is key to lift investment from relatively low levels. Economic growth is stable Real GDP grew by 5.4% in the first quarter of 2025, supported by robust household and government consumption, as investment went through a soft patch. Economic activity has been underpinned by a strong labour market, with unemployment reaching 3.9% in March, among the lowest values in two decades. Low inflation has supported real household incomes and exposure to higher US tariffs has been relatively limited, with merchandise exports to the United States amounting to around 2½ per cent of GDP, but high borrowing costs have continued to weigh on investment. While industrial production and tourist arrivals have declined in annual terms, business sentiment has remained resilient, suggesting broadly stable growth in the first half of 2025. Headline inflation has come down to 1.4% in April, with core inflation at 2.2% remaining within the central bank’s target band of 2-4%. Declining food and fuel prices drove the decline in headline inflation, while core inflation continued to ease on the back of moderate domestic demand growth. The exchange rate has remained broadly stable since the beginning of the year and global energy prices have come down, easing price pressures.  229 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Philippines 1.

With real GDP expected to grow below trend and stable inflation expectations, there is room to continue the easing cycle over 2025-26 to bring the policy rate to a more neutral level of around 4.75-5% in the latter half of 2026. Fiscal policy will be slightly restrictive over 2025-26, as the authorities are expected to continue gradual fiscal consolidation to put public debt – currently at around 60% of GDP – on a declining path. The overall macroeconomic policy mix strikes a balance between fiscal prudence and support to growth among global headwinds. The economy will grow around trend Real GDP will grow by 5.6% in 2025 before picking up slightly to 6% in 2026. Household consumption is expected to remain robust, as strong labour market performance supports real household incomes amid low inflation. Investment will recover in the first half of 2025 as borrowing costs decline, but the recent escalation of global trade tensions is expected to weigh on external demand and export revenues. Inflation is expected to rise gradually to the mid-point of the central bank’s target range, as temporary effects from lower food and global energy prices fade. Risks are broadly balanced. A sharper-than-expected global economic slowdown – especially in the United States and China – could weaken demand for exports and dent remittances, weighing on consumption and investment. On the upside, the recent liberalisation of foreign investment rules and enhanced fiscal incentives offer a chance to offset headwinds from exports with higher capital inflows. Structural reforms are needed to boost growth To foster broad-based economic growth, the Philippines should build upon recent pro-competition reforms, such as the amended Public Services Act that reduced barriers to foreign investment in services. Further streamlining regulations across key network sectors, such as energy, telecommunications and transport, can reduce barriers to entry and encourage private investment. Addressing labour market challenges is crucial to boost productivity and provide workers with greater security. This includes reforms to reduce non-wage labour costs and ease rigidities in labour market regulations, which would help incentivise businesses to formalise employment. Enhancing women's participation in the labour force through improved access to affordable childcare and flexible work arrangements would enable the Philippines to leverage its substantial human capital, thereby fostering economic growth and reducing gender disparities in employment.  231 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Poland The economy will grow by 3.2% this year and 2.7% in 2026, supported by falling inflation, lower interest rates and rising public investment. Accelerating fiscal consolidation and the impact of unfolding global uncertainties will weaken activity, but EU funds will continue to boost investment. Inflation will rise to 4.1% this year as electricity price caps are phased out, before declining to 2.6% in 2026. A sharper global slowdown in trade and an increase in geopolitical tensions could lead to lower growth, while more persistent wage growth than anticipated poses an upside risk to inflation. With underlying price pressures easing, monetary policy can become less restrictive. Given the large fiscal deficit, a gradual and sustained fiscal policy tightening is needed to rebuild fiscal buffers. Improving and expanding adult education and raising the minimum pension age could help to alleviate labour shortages and strengthen growth. Growth is underpinned by a recovery in consumption The Polish economy grew by 2.9% last year, underpinned by rising public spending and recovering private consumption. The labour market remains strong, with low unemployment and solid, yet easing, wage growth. Inflation has been affected by the reintroduction of VAT on food and the partial lifting of the freeze on energy prices. Headline inflation was 4.3% in April, still above the central bank’s target, and core inflation was 3.4%. Recent high-frequency indicators and the GDP flash estimate point to a continued recovery at the beginning of the year. Poland Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and Eurostat.

Total exports to the United States accounted for less than 3% of Polish GDP and the same share of employment in 2023. However, the impact of any US tariff restrictions on the EU is likely to weaken demand in export markets and further increase business uncertainty. Monetary policy easing is warranted as inflation subsides and fiscal policy becomes more restrictive In a first cut since late 2023, the central bank lowered the interest rate in May to 5.25%. Excise tax increases this year and again in 2026, together with the planned lifting of the electricity price cap in September, will put upward pressure on prices, but inflation is expected to return to target in the second half of 2025. Monetary policy is assumed to ease further gradually this year and next, with policy rates moving towards 4% by the end of 2026, as inflationary pressures subside. Planned multi-annual fiscal consolidation will weigh on growth, with higher income tax revenues due to ‘bracket creep’ and a nominal freeze of some family benefits. It will need to accommodate increased defence spending, which is set to rise from the current 4.7% to 5% of GDP next year. Overall, the fiscal stance is expected to tighten by 0.6% of GDP in 2025-26. Growth will pick up this year but moderate in 2026 GDP growth will strengthen to 3.2% this year, supported by falling inflation, lower interest rates and rising public investment.

Next year, the accelerating pace of fiscal consolidation and the impact of a weaker global environment will contribute to the slowdown, with GDP growth moderating to 2.7%. Nevertheless, public investment should remain strong, supported by the continued payout of EU funds. Annual inflation will peak at 4.1% this year, in part due to tax and regulated price increases. In 2026, the annual inflation rate will ease to 2.6%. The unemployment rate will remain low, reaching 2.8% this year and 2.7% in 2026. A sharper global slowdown in trade and an increase in geopolitical tensions could lead to lower growth, while more persistent wage growth poses an upside risk to inflation. Fiscal consolidation and reforms to raise labour participation are needed The acceleration of the planned fiscal consolidation will allow for further monetary policy easing. An ambitious pace of fiscal adjustment is planned for 2026 and beyond, although borrowing will remain higher due to increases in defence spending. To support consolidation, property and environmental taxes should be increased. A full phase-out of energy support would provide households adequate price signals helping the net zero transition, as much of the energy still comes from coal. Public investment has been spared from the consolidation effort, which is welcome. Building a single pipeline of ready projects should be considered, as well as centralised annual monitoring of all major projects including those of state-owned enterprises. Improving and expanding uptake of adult education and raising the pension age could help address skill and labour shortages. 234  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Portugal Real GDP growth is projected to remain at 1.9% in 2025 and 2026. A tight labour market, minimum wage increases and the decline of historically high savings will raise private consumption. Faster implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP) will boost public investment and consumption. Export growth is expected to slow further due to softening global demand, rising trade barriers and a 10% US tariff on Portuguese goods, including steel and autos. As import prices rise and labour demand remains high, inflation will moderate only slowly to 2.1% in 2026. Fiscal policy will remain expansionary. Implementation of the RRP, as well as household and corporate tax cuts will raise internal demand, while sustained fiscal surpluses will bring public debt down to 89.8% of GDP in 2026 (Maastricht definition). Lowering entry barriers in services, especially the retail sector, further streamlining regulations, improving counselling for students and workers, and enhancing childcare services would boost investment and productivity. Over the medium term, regular spending reviews would help to address mounting spending pressures from an ageing population and strong investment needs. Growth is easing Growth strengthened to 2.8% in the year to the fourth quarter of 2024 before easing to 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Employment growth remained strong at 2.2% in the year to March 2025, and labour costs per employee increased by 5.4% in the year to the first quarter of 2025. A strong labour market, tax cuts and disinflation have supported steady gains in real disposable income. Despite rising household savings, private consumption and housing investment accelerated in late 2024. However, domestic demand stagnated in the first quarter of 2025, while the trade balance worsened. Weakening international economic prospects and high uncertainty lowered household confidence in March and April 2025, though business confidence remained above its long-term average.

Portuguese exporters are facing a standard 10% tariff on goods by the United States as well as specific tariffs on steel, aluminium and the automotive industry. Though direct exports of goods and services to the United States account for only 2.8% of GDP, Portugal also faces weakening external demand from its main European trading partners. Fiscal policy will remain expansionary Fiscal policy is set to remain expansionary, with fiscal easing of around 1.5% of GDP expected between 2024 and 2026. Spending from RRP grants is expected to increase from 0.7% of GDP in 2024 to 2.3% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026, boosting investment and public consumption without affecting the budget balance. Persistent fiscal surpluses will lower public debt to 89.8% of GDP in 2026 (Maastricht definition). Activity will also be supported by increasing disbursements of RRP loans, higher public wages, the indexation of pension benefits, a further reduction in the personal income tax, and business tax cuts. Increasing environmental taxes and efforts to curb tax avoidance will boost public revenues. At the same time, the minimum wage rose by 6.1% in 2025, and a further increase expected in 2026 will raise household incomes. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Portugal Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 216.5 7.0 2.6 1.9 1.9 1.9 Private consumption 137.1 5.6 1.9 3.2 2.8 1.6 Government consumption 40.1 1.7 0.6 1.1 1.2 1.0 Gross fixed capital formation 44.4 3.3 3.6 3.0 3.2 3.7 Final domestic demand 221.6 4.4 2.0 2.8 2.6 1.9 Stockbuilding¹ 0.9 0.3 -0.3 -0.1 -0.2 0.1 Total domestic demand 222.5 4.7 1.7 2.6 2.4 2.0 Exports of goods and services 89.9 17.2 3.8 3.4 1.3 2.6 Imports of goods and services 96.0 11.3 1.8 4.9 2.3 2.7 Net exports¹ - 6.0 2.1 1.0 -0.7 -0.4 0.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 5.3 7.0 4.5 2.5 2.1 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 8.1 5.3 2.7 2.1 2.1 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 5.0 5.4 2.7 2.4 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 6.1 6.5 6.4 6.4 6.4 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ -2.0 -1.3 3.4 5.0 4.6 General government financial balance³ (% of GDP) _ -0.3 1.2 0.7 0.2 -0.3 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 114.3 104.8 100.6 97.7 95.5 General government debt, Maastricht definition⁴ (% of GDP) _ 111.2 97.7 94.9 92.0 89.8 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -2.0 0.6 2.2 1.1 1.1 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Spending of European funds is boosting investment, but the projected slowdown in global activity and European growth will weigh on exports and private investment. Sustained wage growth and robust employment will raise consumption, especially as inflation and debt servicing costs are set to remain moderate. Tax cuts, increasing social transfers and higher public wages will support household incomes but also slow the decline in inflation. Headline consumer price inflation will moderate to 2.1% in 2025 and 2026 as import prices rise and services price pressures diminish slowly. A further decline in the household saving rate and stronger-than-expected wage developments could strengthen consumption but also fuel inflation. Higher than expected public expenditures, notably on defence, could also raise internal demand. Global financial tightening and elevated uncertainty could weigh more heavily on private investment and confidence than currently assumed, implying both lower growth and lower inflation. Policy should support stronger and more sustainable growth Sustained productivity growth, higher employment and more efficient public spending are needed to face rapid population ageing and significant investment needs, including in human capital, while maintaining public debt on a firmly declining path. Continuing to roll out new accounting standards, developing performance budgeting and reducing tax expenditures would improve the efficiency of public spending and help to shift its structure towards investment. Strengthening environmental and property taxation while protecting vulnerable groups would help to attain ambitious climate goals and make room to lower taxes on low-wage workers. Reducing entry barriers in services, including in the retail sector, would raise investment and productivity. Improved counselling to guide study and reskilling choices and strengthening active labour market policies that focus on smaller firms would reduce skill and labour shortages. Better childcare services for low-income households could further raise the labour force participation of women, further easing labour shortages.  237 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Romania After slowing in 2024, GDP growth is projected to increase to 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026. Private consumption is set to remain a key driver of growth, supported by higher wages and pensions. Following a decline in 2024, investment is projected to expand gradually, supported by EU-funded infrastructure projects. Export dynamics are expected to remain weak in early 2025 and to recover gradually thereafter. The monetary policy stance is expected to remain restrictive to ensure a convergence of inflation to target. Faster budget consolidation is necessary for the sustainability of the public finances and to narrow the large external deficit. Raising revenues from less distortive taxes would free up fiscal space for new spending on social protection, health, education, and infrastructure. Improving the absorption of EU funds would boost growth potential through key investments. GDP growth slowed in 2024 GDP growth slowed to 0.8% in 2024, held back by stagnating manufacturing output, and contracting activity in construction and agriculture. On the expenditure side, private consumption was the main driver of growth, supported by public wage and pension increases. Higher incomes boosted imports, whereas exports declined, affected by weak external demand. Gross fixed capital formation also contracted. High wage growth has kept pressure on consumer prices and resulted in strong increases in unit labour costs, posing risks to cost competitiveness. Inflation remains above target, at 4.9% in April 2025. Despite the economic slowdown, the unemployment rate has remained broadly stable. According to the flash estimate, GDP grew by 0.5% over the year to the first quarter of 2025. High-frequency indicators in early 2025 present mixed signals. After improving in February and in March, business sentiment decreased in April. Industrial output declined by 7.7% year-on-year in March, driven by a sharp contraction in the automotive sector.

However, higher US tariffs are expected also to indirectly weigh on Romania’s exports through reduced external demand from its key EU trade partners. Monetary policy is set to remain tight and fiscal consolidation limited The monetary stance is set to remain restrictive, with some easing projected from the third quarter of 2025 The benchmark rate is expected to decline to below 5% by the end of 2026 as inflation converges to target. The budget deficit is forecast to remain elevated over the projection, following fiscal slippage in 2024 caused by higher spending on pensions and public wages, which saw the budget deficit reach 9.3% of GDP compared to an initial target of 5%. As of 2025, a recent package of fiscal measures is intended to reduce the budget deficit by containing the growth of public wages and pensions. The budget deficit is projected to stay at 9.3% in 2025 and 2026, despite a fiscal consolidation of the underlying primary balance of 1.4% of GDP over 2025-26.

Labour market performance is expected to remain strong, with the unemployment rate projected to be 5.5% in 2026. Consumer price inflation is expected to return to the target band, reaching 3.5% in the first quarter of 2026. A lack of fiscal consolidation or persisting wage pressures could keep inflation elevated for longer and increase Romania’s external vulnerabilities. Stronger absorption of EU funds is critical to boost investment and raise potential output Improving the absorption of EU funds, including under the Recovery and Resilience Fund, can play a direct role in raising Romania’s economic potential, while helping catalyse additional private investment and limiting pressures on public finances. Strengthening government revenues is necessary to ensure sustainable public finances and to address emerging spending pressures. Additionally, tax reforms should focus on eliminating distortions and loopholes in the system and strengthening tax enforcement, while broadening the value-added tax base. Increasing labour force participation would help address the challenges related to a shrinking working age population. This will require policies to incentivise women to work and to improve education completion rates, particularly in rural areas. Ongoing governance reforms would complement efforts to reduce firms’ compliance costs with regulations. Transitioning from fossil fuels will require accelerating renewable energy deployment and upgrading power grids. 240  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Slovak Republic Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.4% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. Exports will slow due to trade barriers lowering foreign demand, particularly in the automotive sector. Accelerated absorption of EU funds will support investment against the headwinds created by heightened economic uncertainty. In an environment of low consumer confidence and high uncertainty, real wage gains on account of lower inflation will primarily be used to rebuild household savings. Escalating geopolitical tensions, further trade barriers and slower-than-expected growth in Europe pose downside risks to the outlook. A sustainable medium-term fiscal strategy is needed to rebuild fiscal buffers, including further reforms to the pension system and changes to family benefits. Enhancing the efficiency of public spending by strengthening project preparation and implementation capacity can increase public investment. Better tertiary education and stronger incentives to participate in adult learning would help reduce skill shortages that remain a barrier to investment. Continuing efforts to fight corruption and strengthening trust in the judiciary system is essential to reducing uncertainty and spurring growth. Growth is slowing amid heightened uncertainty Real GDP grew by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter according to the Eurostat flash estimate. Weak business sentiment, low consumer confidence, and slow momentum in industry and retail trade point to sluggish growth in the second quarter of 2025. Uncertainty is weighing on exports and investment spending, while increased absorption of EU funds boosts capital formation. Harmonised consumer price inflation has risen to 3.9% in April, reflecting higher VAT rates and persistent service price growth. Harmonised core inflation remained elevated at 5.5% in April. Real wage growth has continued to strengthen. The labour market is tight, with the unemployment rate and employment rate remaining at historic lows and highs respectively.

The Slovak Republic is highly exposed to trade barriers, due to its specialisation in the highly trade-dependent automotive value chain. The sector and associated industries account for 10% of total value added, among the highest in the OECD, and more than 80% of gross goods exports to the United States come from the automotive sector, which is now facing 25% tariffs. Furthermore, Slovakia’s deep linkages to the European automotive value chain will transmit the effects of lower foreign demand for automotive output. Tighter fiscal policy to reduce the deficit The fiscal deficit remained high in 2024, at 5.3% of GDP. A revised fiscal plan aims to reduce the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2028, one year later than previously envisaged. Most instruments are on the revenue side, thus increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio. Notably, a financial transactions tax was introduced from 1 April 2025. The tax will be deducted by banks from each transaction and ATM withdrawals. The basic VAT rate will increase to 23% from 20%. There are also increased fees for motorway stamps, tolls and vehicle taxes for companies. The increase in taxes will help reduce the budget deficit to 4.8% in 2025. For 2026, the projections assume that higher defence expenditures and rising interest costs on debt will slow consolidation efforts, and the fiscal deficit is expected to narrow just slightly to 4.7%. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Slovak Republic Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 101.9 0.4 2.2 2.1 1.4 1.1 Private consumption 57.6 5.2 -3.0 2.8 0.8 1.1 Government consumption 21.6 -2.9 -2.5 3.7 1.7 1.6 Gross fixed capital formation 20.0 4.3 4.0 1.8 -0.3 2.5 Final domestic demand 99.1 3.2 -1.5 2.8 0.8 1.5 Stockbuilding¹ 3.2 -1.4 -3.4 0.9 0.2 0.0 Total domestic demand 102.3 1.7 -4.6 3.8 1.0 1.5 Exports of goods and services 92.2 2.9 -0.2 -0.2 1.3 2.0 Imports of goods and services 92.6 4.4 -7.0 1.5 0.7 2.4 Net exports¹ - 0.4 -1.4 7.1 -1.5 0.5 -0.4 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 7.5 10.1 3.6 2.8 2.8 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 12.1 11.0 3.2 3.5 2.5 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 8.2 9.5 4.3 4.9 2.6 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 6.1 5.8 5.3 5.4 5.4 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ -1.9 0.5 -0.8 0.3 1.2 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -1.7 -5.2 -5.3 -4.8 -4.7 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 65.2 64.8 67.5 70.7 73.7 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 57.7 55.6 59.3 62.4 65.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -9.6 -1.7 -2.6 -3.8 -3.7 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 1.

Heightened uncertainty due to the risk of additional trade restrictions will weaken investment growth. Real wage gains, due to lower inflation, will primarily be used to rebuild household savings, and to a lower extent to support consumption. Headline inflation is projected to rise to 3.5% in 2025 before gradually falling back to 2.5% in 2026. The fiscal consolidation package, while needed, focuses almost exclusively on revenue-raising measures and does little to tackle expenditures and spending inefficiencies, which risks lowering growth in the medium\u0002term. Lower foreign demand and heightened uncertainty would negatively affect trade and investment. Promoting investment through reforms and incentives The public finances deteriorated following the pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, resulting in public debt remaining above pre-pandemic levels. A sustainable medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy that reduces expenditures and broadens the tax base is needed to create fiscal space, with a focus on improving the efficiency of public spending and addressing the challenges of rapid population ageing. Targeted training to strengthen project preparation and implementation capacity can boost public investment by maximising the impact of substantial inflows of EU funds. Making R&D tax allowances refundable for small and young companies could help increase R&D investment. Skills shortages are a significant and persistent barrier to investment. Expanding work-based learning, improving the quality of tertiary education through targeted funding, strengthening incentives to participate in adult learning, and increasing training for the unemployed would help reduce skill imbalances, retain and attract high skilled people, and boost productivity. Continuing efforts to fight corruption and strengthening trust in the judiciary system is also essential to unleash investment.  243 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Slovenia GDP is projected to grow by 1.6% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, driven by domestic demand. Strong wage growth will support private consumption, and investment will gradually rise with government spending on post-flood reconstruction and EU funds. Risks are tilted to the downside and include rising trade tensions, stronger-than-expected wage growth, reduced competitiveness, and prolonged inflation. Upside risks involve faster reconstruction efforts and increased EU spending that boosts investment activity. Fiscal policy will be expansionary in 2025 and 2026 due to increased defence and reconstruction spending. Structural measures include higher long-term care spending funded by a higher social security contribution rate. In addition to the upcoming pension reform, further tax policy reforms are needed for fiscal sustainability in the long-term, while investment would benefit from supply-side reforms such as easier immigration processes and streamlined planning and permitting. Economic activity has slowed Economic activity declined by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2025, driven by negative net exports, while domestic demand supported growth. Recent indicators are mixed: consumer and business sentiment improved slightly to long-term averages in May, but both industrial production and retail trade turnover (without automotive fuels) declined by 1.2% month-on-month in March. The labour market remains tight, with a 3.2% unemployment rate in March, which, together with rising public wages due to a public pay reform, is fuelling strong wage growth. Hourly labour costs rose 6.8% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, contributing to annual service inflation of 3.8% and annual core inflation of 2.5% in April, with annual headline inflation at 2.3%.

The impact of euro area monetary easing on financial conditions has now passed through, with loans to the non-banking sector growing by 7.6% over the year to March. Fiscal policy will be expansionary The fiscal policy stance is expected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026, with fiscal easing of 0.6% of GDP over 2025-26 driven by higher defence and post-flood reconstruction spending. Still, public debt (according to Maastricht definition) is projected to decline to 66% of GDP by 2026. Reconstruction spending is funded by a temporary increase in the corporate income tax rate and the introduction of a temporary bank levy. The government announced a rise in defence spending, to 2% of GDP in 2025 and 3% of GDP in 2030. Structural measures include higher spending on public wages by 0.5% of GDP in both 2025 and 2026 due to public sector wage reforms and increased long-term care spending by 0.3% of GDP in 2025 and 0.7% of GDP in 2026, funded by a 2 percentage point increase in the social security contribution rate. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Slovenia Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 52.0 2.7 2.1 1.6 1.6 2.4 Private consumption 26.8 5.3 0.1 1.6 1.3 1.7 Government consumption 10.8 -0.7 2.4 8.5 1.1 2.8 Gross fixed capital formation 10.5 4.2 3.9 -3.7 -1.4 2.6 Final domestic demand 48.1 3.7 1.5 1.8 0.7 2.1 Stockbuilding¹ 0.8 0.8 -1.5 0.3 1.3 0.0 Total domestic demand 49.0 4.5 -0.2 2.1 2.1 2.0 Exports of goods and services 43.7 6.8 -2.0 3.2 0.0 2.0 Imports of goods and services 40.6 9.2 -4.5 3.9 1.2 1.5 Net exports¹ 3.1 -1.5 2.3 -0.4 -0.9 0.4 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.5 10.1 3.1 4.2 2.3 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 9.3 7.2 2.0 2.6 2.3 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 5.9 6.7 2.9 2.3 2.3 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 4.0 3.7 3.7 3.7 3.7 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 6.1 7.2 10.0 10.0 10.8 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -3.0 -2.6 -0.9 -1.7 -1.5 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 74.5 72.2 70.8 69.9 69.3 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 72.7 68.4 67.0 66.2 65.6 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -1.1 4.5 4.4 3.5 4.1 Percentage changes, volume (2010 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Private consumption will benefit from a tight labour market and strong real wage growth. Investment will gradually rebound due to post-flood reconstruction spending and EU funds, offsetting the effects of weak external demand and higher uncertainty. The labour market will remain tight, keeping wage growth elevated. Wage pressures will keep inflation above 2% in 2025 and 2026. Downside risks include rising trade tensions that could further dampen exports and private investment. Also, stronger-than-expected wage growth could reduce competitiveness and keep inflationary pressures elevated for longer. On the upside, faster implementation of reconstruction and EU spending could boost investment activity. Structural reforms will help raising investment and growth Fiscal consolidation, as outlined in the national medium-term fiscal plan, is essential to rebuild fiscal buffers. While debt-financed defence spending is justified by current geopolitical risks, permanent increases will require spending reprioritisation. The social partners agreed on pension reforms—currently under parliamentary review—that include gradually raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 from 2028, extending the period for pension calculations from the most favourable 24 contribution years to 40 years minus the five best, and a greater weight of inflation in pension indexation. These reforms should be combined with further tax policy reforms to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. This includes boosting labour supply by removing tax disincentives for second earners and single parents to work full time. Investment will benefit from structural reforms, such as easing immigration for non-EU workers and streamlining planning and permitting processes. These efforts should be paired with growth-friendly tax reforms to reduce the labour tax burden, funded by higher consumption, environmental and recurrent immovable property taxation. 246  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 South Africa GDP is projected to increase by 1.3% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. High uncertainty and declining confidence will weigh on domestic demand, though easing monetary policy will provide support. The increase in tariffs on imports into the United States will weigh on exports. An easing in access to pension savings from late 2024 will support consumption. Inflation will fall in the near term following the decline in global oil prices, but will strengthen during the second half of 2025 and in 2026, as activity strengthens. Fiscal consolidation in 2025 and 2026 will help stabilise public debt. Reinforcing spending rules and broadening the narrow tax base would further support debt sustainability. Monetary policy is projected to continue easing in 2025 to slightly below neutral rates. Continued progress in reforms to improve the efficiency and governance of state-owned enterprises, to increase the supply of electricity, and to ease logistics bottlenecks and regulation will support investment and stronger potential growth. Consumer confidence has fallen and exchange rate volatility has increased Consumer confidence fell in the first quarter of 2025 alongside domestic political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, wiping out more than its increase over 2024. Business confidence remained above its long-term average in the first quarter of 2025. The unemployment rate increased to 32.6% in the first quarter of 2025, after having declined over the previous three quarters. Core inflation continues to ease, reaching 3% in April, slightly above headline inflation, which was 2.8%. The United States has increased tariffs on imports from South Africa to 10%, though the exclusion of certain critical minerals and bullion slightly lowers the effective rate. South Africa sends around 7.6% of its exports to the United States, limiting the impact on GDP. Spreads between South African and US long\u0002term bond yields have increased in recent months, suggesting that the perceived risk of investing in South Africa has increased. The exchange rate against the US dollar depreciated sharply in early April, although it has reversed since then.

Revenue measures include no inflationary adjustment to income-tax brackets, adding 0.2% of GDP of revenues in each fiscal year, and additional tax measures to be announced in the 2026 Budget, representing 0.2% of GDP for the 2026/27 fiscal year. Conversely, expenditure as a share of GDP is expected to rise in the 2025/26 fiscal year, before easing. This is driven by a 0.2% of GDP rise in water, sanitation and road infrastructure investment and exceptional debt relief for the state electricity operator, Eskom, of around 1% of GDP. Transfers from the central bank to government accounts (via the Gold and Financial Contingency Reserve Account), equivalent to 0.3% of GDP, will contribute to debt reduction for the second consecutive year, albeit to a lesser extent. The central bank lowered policy rates by 75 basis points to 7.5% between September and January as inflation eased. Rates are projected to decrease by a further 50 basis points over 2025. Further volatility in the exchange rate is creating significant uncertainty around the outlook for inflation and monetary policy. Activity will increase moderately, amidst significant uncertainty The economy is projected to grow moderately in 2025 and 2026. Monetary policy easing and progress in electricity availability are set to support investment. Private consumption will benefit to some extent from the 2024 pension reform, which eases access to retirement funds. Exports will increase only gradually, though, weighed down by the increase in US tariffs. As economic growth strengthens gradually and the negative output gap narrows, inflation will rise to 4.2% in 2026 and the unemployment rate will decrease slightly to 32.1% in 2026. Risks to the outlook remain high. On the downside, trade tensions have heightened uncertainty and slower progress than expected in easing freight and port bottlenecks could weigh on activity. On the positive side, accelerated reform of electricity availability would strengthen the recovery in investment, boosting potential growth. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 South Africa Current prices ZAR billion GDP at market prices 6 220.2 1.9 0.7 0.6 1.3 1.4 Private consumption 3 847.3 2.5 0.7 1.0 1.4 1.3 Government consumption 1 192.9 0.6 1.9 0.4 2.7 1.3 Gross fixed capital formation 811.8 4.8 3.9 -3.7 1.2 4.0 Final domestic demand 5 852.1 2.4 1.4 0.2 1.6 1.7 Stockbuilding¹ - 15.9 1.5 -0.6 -1.0 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 5 836.2 4.0 0.8 -0.7 1.6 1.7 Exports of goods and services 1 934.7 6.8 3.7 -2.0 0.3 1.5 Imports of goods and services 1 550.8 15.0 3.9 -6.3 1.5 2.3 Net exports¹ 383.9 -2.1 -0.1 1.3 -0.3 -0.2 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 5.0 4.8 3.8 3.9 4.5 Consumer price index _ 6.9 5.9 4.4 3.2 4.2 Core inflation index² _ 4.6 5.1 4.2 3.3 4.3 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -5.0 -6.6 -5.4 -6.6 -5.1 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -0.5 -1.6 -0.6 -1.3 -1.8 Percentage changes, volume (2015 prices) 1.

Strengthening the fiscal framework through stricter spending controls and reinforced fiscal rules anchored to a stable debt target would support fiscal consolidation and help reduce the risk premium, as well as the risk that elevated government borrowing crowds out private investment. Swift implementation of reforms will be key to boosting the current low level of investment. Easing burdensome licensing, permits and complex procurement rules will support firm entry and expansion. Reforms in the electricity sector would enhance businesses’ ability to operate efficiently and strengthen their incentives to invest. Lastly, creating a business-friendly environment would support rail investment needs by reforming the governance of transport state-owned enterprises, including by establishing a regulator and promoting competition.  249 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Spain Real GDP growth is projected at 2.4% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. Growth will be driven by domestic demand, with consumption supported by a robust labour market, real income gains and falling inflation. Investment is expected to rise over 2025-26 supported by lower financing costs and the implementation of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (RTRP). Export growth will slow, reflecting weak demand in trading partners, rising trade fragmentation and the dampening effect of US tariffs. Risks to economic growth are skewed to the downside, including escalating geopolitical and trade tensions, further tariff increases on EU exports, increased uncertainty, and tighter global financial conditions. The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow to 2.8% of GDP in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026, helped by robust economic growth. In 2026, lower spending growth due to the phase-out of public transportation subsidies and DANA support measures will back further consolidation efforts, placing gross public debt on a downward trend. Lowering entry barriers in services, further streamlining regulations at all levels of government, and accelerating public-private partnerships under the RTRP would boost investment and potential growth. Economic activity remains strong Growth reached 2.8% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, driven by robust gross capital formation and private consumption. A strong labour market and wage growth supported steady gains in real disposable incomes. Social security affiliations rose by 2.3% over the year to April 2025, while the unemployment rate reached 10.9% in March 2025. Business expectations continued to signal expansion in April, though with signs of moderation. Annual headline inflation eased to 2.2% in April 2025 due to lower energy prices, following a temporary rise earlier in the year linked to the expiration of VAT reductions on electricity. Core inflation stood at 3.0% in April, largely driven by more persistent services inflation. Spain Source: Eurostat; and OECD Economic Outlook 117 database.

In February, the goods trade deficit widened, with import growth of 3.5% year-on-year while exports grew by just 0.4%. Meanwhile, the services surplus increased to 6.7% of GDP, supported by a rise in tourism. The United States has imposed a 10% import tariff on EU goods, but Spain’s direct exposure is limited, as Spanish goods exports to the United States only represented around 1% of GDP in 2024. Fiscal consolidation continues The fiscal deficit will narrow to 2.8% in 2025, and 2.3% in 2026, from 3.2% in 2024, helped by mild fiscal consolidation. Most of the temporary support measures introduced during the inflationary shock have been phased out, including the planned expiration of public transportation subsidies by June 2025. The consolidation is underpinned by higher revenues from strong job creation and previously announced tax measures. Spending declines reflect the phase-out of energy related and DANA support measures. The projections also incorporate a gradual increase in defence spending in 2025 and 2026, and government initiatives to help sectors affected by trade tensions, amounting to EUR 14 billion (0.9% of GDP), with most support channelled through guarantee schemes and loans. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Spain Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 1 235.5 6.2 2.7 3.2 2.4 1.9 Private consumption 693.6 4.8 1.8 2.9 2.7 1.9 Government consumption 259.4 0.6 5.2 4.1 2.2 1.7 Gross fixed capital formation 249.6 3.3 2.1 3.0 4.4 2.7 Final domestic demand 1 202.6 3.6 2.6 3.2 2.9 2.0 Stockbuilding¹ 20.7 0.4 -0.8 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 Total domestic demand 1 223.2 3.9 1.7 2.9 2.8 2.0 Exports of goods and services 417.1 14.3 2.8 3.1 2.2 2.2 Imports of goods and services 404.8 7.7 0.3 2.4 3.3 2.3 Net exports¹ 12.2 2.3 1.0 0.3 -0.3 0.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 4.7 6.2 3.0 2.3 1.8 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 8.3 3.4 2.9 2.4 1.9 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 3.8 4.1 2.8 2.3 2.0 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 13.0 12.2 11.3 10.7 10.1 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 2.5 6.1 6.7 6.2 6.0 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -4.6 -3.5 -3.2 -2.8 -2.3 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 113.7 111.0 108.5 107.0 105.9 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 109.5 105.1 101.8 100.4 99.3 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 0.4 2.7 3.0 2.8 2.8 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 1.

Growth will be driven by domestic demand, supported by a solid labour market, real income gains, and high household savings. Disbursements of the RTPR funds and lower interest rates will support investment, though execution delays and tighter global financing conditions could limit the rebound. Export growth is expected to slow due to weak demand in key trading partners and the recently imposed 10% effective US tariff on EU goods and sector-specific rates as high as 25% on autos and steel. While Spain is less active in these sectors than other EU countries, exports of machinery and agri-food products may still be affected. Headline inflation will reach 1.9% in 2026, aided by lower food and energy prices and limited wage pressures. Downside risks remain elevated, particularly from escalating geopolitical and trade tensions, which could further dampen external demand, increase uncertainty, and delay investments linked to the RTPR. Enhancing potential growth and meeting fiscal goals is key Although the fiscal deficit and public-debt-to-GDP have declined, continued consolidation remains essential to put gross public debt on a downward trend, comply with the EU fiscal rules and accommodate rising spending pressures from population ageing and the green transition. Gradually broadening the value added tax base, increasing environmental taxes, and improving public spending efficiency would support consolidation efforts and create space for growth-enhancing spending. Gross fixed capital formation per working-age person has remained significantly below the European average since the global financial crisis, and the recovery in investment has been slow since the pandemic. Lowering entry barriers in services, further streamlining and levelling regulations across levels of government, and accelerating public-private partnerships under the RTRP, would further stimulate investment and raise potential growth. 252  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Sweden Sweden’s economy is expected to grow by 1.6% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026. In the short term, heightened uncertainty will dampen investment, though domestic demand is expected to gradually recover as confidence improves. Private consumption will strengthen, supported by rising real incomes and improving employment conditions. Unemployment is set to decline steadily as labour demand increases. However, risks remain skewed to the downside, particularly due to heightened global uncertainty. The Riksbank has appropriately paused monetary easing, but should remain agile and respond to incoming data. The mildly expansionary fiscal policy supports the economy and defence needs but could be better targeted. To sustain employment growth amid an ageing population, Sweden must address skill gaps among inactive and unemployed adults. Easing rental regulations and land-use planning would improve housing supply and mobility. Rising climate costs highlight the urgent need for stronger market-based adaptation measures. Growth momentum is weak Economic activity continued to recover in late 2024, supported by easing inflation and monetary accommodation. However, recent indicators, including monthly GDP and industrial production, suggest that momentum weakened in early 2025. Domestic demand remains subdued. Inflation, measured by the consumer price index with a fixed mortgage rate (CPIF), the key metric for the Riksbank, is falling again following a temporary spike driven by rising food prices and changes in the consumption basket. Wage growth is set to remain contained in 2025-26 in line with negotiated industrial pay increases totalling 6.4% over two years. Labour market conditions had shown signs of stabilising, but forward-looking indicators point to further softening in the short term. An improvement in business sentiment has stalled, with declining hiring plans. Household sentiment has deteriorated sharply, with increased concerns about unemployment. Although the household saving rate is declining, it remains elevated by historical standards. Sweden Source: National Institute of Economic Research; Sveriges Riksbank; and Statistics Sweden.

While Sweden’s diversified export portfolio provides some resilience to trade disruptions and the increase in the US tariff on merchandise imports from Sweden, industries such as automotive and steel face mounting challenges, notably those lacking a local manufacturing or assembly footprint in the United States. Monetary policy easing is on hold while fiscal policy turns slightly expansionary The Riksbank paused monetary easing in March 2025, holding the policy rate at 2.25% in response to elevated inflation. The rate is assumed to remain at this broadly neutral level through the end of 2026. Against the backdrop of subdued domestic demand, the 2025 budget introduced new measures worth nearly 0.9% of GDP. These include tax cuts on fuel and pensions, an enhanced earned income tax credit and lower taxes on investment savings. Additional stimulus of 0.2% of GDP was announced in the April Spring budget bill, including a new home renovation tax break and increased road maintenance spending. Defence spending will rise further in 2025 to 2.4% of GDP (NATO’s definition), with a goal of reaching 3.5% of GDP by 2030. Fiscal policy is expected to remain slightly expansionary in 2026 as economic slack persists. The move from a surplus target to a balanced budget rule, effective from 2027, is expected to influence fiscal planning already in 2026. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Sweden Current prices SEK billion GDP at market prices 5 452.2 1.6 0.1 0.7 1.6 2.3 Private consumption 2 434.3 2.9 -2.0 0.3 1.0 2.2 Government consumption 1 408.8 0.8 1.8 1.2 1.4 2.0 Gross fixed capital formation 1 363.7 0.4 -1.2 -1.2 2.4 3.0 Final domestic demand 5 206.7 1.7 -0.8 0.2 1.5 2.4 Stockbuilding¹ 11.0 1.2 -1.5 0.3 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 5 217.7 2.9 -2.3 0.6 1.4 2.4 Exports of goods and services 2 573.3 6.2 4.0 2.4 2.3 1.7 Imports of goods and services 2 338.8 9.7 -0.5 1.7 1.5 1.9 Net exports¹ 234.5 -1.2 2.4 0.4 0.5 0.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 5.7 6.0 3.0 2.6 2.0 Consumer price index² _ 8.4 8.5 2.8 1.3 2.0 Core inflation index³ _ 5.8 10.0 4.1 1.1 2.0 Consumer price index with fixed interest rates _ 7.7 6.0 1.9 2.8 2.0 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 7.5 7.7 8.4 8.7 8.3 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 12.1 13.6 15.7 15.6 15.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 1.0 -0.8 -1.5 -1.4 -1.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition⁴ (% of GDP) _ 33.9 31.6 33.5 33.7 33.9 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 4.7 7.0 7.4 6.8 6.6 Percentage changes, volume (2023 prices) 1.

Near-term uncertainty will continue to weigh on household consumption and business investment. Private consumption is expected to recover gradually, supported by rising real incomes and improving labour market conditions. Inflation is projected to stabilise around target, with continued economic slack helping to contain price pressures. Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. A prolonged slowdown in key trading partners and spiralling trade protectionism could further strain the highly open economy. A more persistent-than-expected increase in precautionary saving could slow the recovery of household consumption. On the upside, a stronger rebound in private consumption, driven by a sharper-than-anticipated decline in the household saving rate, could support a more robust recovery. Supporting the recovery through targeted measures and structural reforms The Riksbank should keep the policy rate unchanged for now, while remaining agile in a volatile environment. The mildly expansionary fiscal stance supports recovery, but tax measures need to be better targeted. Fuel tax cuts are regressive and ineffective in easing cost-of-living pressures, while tax relief for investment savings may raise equity concerns. Looking ahead, addressing skills deficiencies among unemployed and inactive adults and further improving support for adult education and training of individuals at risk of unemployment will be essential to continue to expand employment in the face of an ageing population. Easing rent controls and streamlining land-use planning would boost housing investment and improve affordability and job matching. The costs of climate change are rising, while funding for adaptation investments remains insufficient. Accelerating market-based measures, particularly risk-based insurance premiums and taxes, is important to close the gap.  255 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Switzerland Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.1% in 2025, and 1.2% in 2026. Private consumption will benefit from rising real wages and employment, while investment will continue its recovery. Export growth will lose momentum amid slower global growth and higher US trade tariffs. Moderate demand pressures will keep inflation within the central bank’s target range. The monetary policy stance will continue to be supportive of growth in 2025-2026. The same holds for fiscal policy as the small headline fiscal surplus expected in 2025 will narrow in 2026, although gross public debt will decrease slightly relative to GDP. Expanding the government one-stop-shop would help increase investment. Relaxing foreign equity restrictions would help to attract more foreign direct investment. Reaching climate neutrality requires further reforms to facilitate investments in renewable energy. Growth has picked up and inflation has slowed GDP grew by 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the previous quarter and adjusted for sporting events. Growth was driven mostly by manufacturing, especially chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and the services sector. Domestic demand remained solid, driven by consumption and investment. Indicators for economic activity grew in early 2025, but surveys suggest that businesses remain cautious about the outlook in the coming months in several industries, including manufacturing. Labour shortages are easing, and recruitment intentions have improved. CPI inflation slowed from 0.6% year-over-year in December to 0.0% in April 2025, and one-year-ahead inflation expectations declined slightly but remain in line with the central bank definition of price stability.

Exports included mostly chemicals and pharmaceutical products. US trade tariffs on imports of pharmaceuticals remain unchanged, but a special probe on these imports is ongoing and could lead to higher specific tariffs being applied. Steel and aluminium exports to the United States face a 25% import tariff, while other goods exports are subject to a 10% import tariff. Monetary and fiscal policies will be supportive of growth The central bank is expected to continue lowering the policy rate, reaching 0% by mid-2025, amid increased trade tensions and uncertainty about the growth outlook. The real interest rate is therefore expected to become negative in the coming quarters, providing support to economic activity. The general government will post a headline surplus of 0.6% of GDP in 2025, which will narrow to 0.1% of GDP in 2026 due to higher pension spending following last year’s reform.

Inflation will increase over 2025-2026, but contained demand pressures will keep it well within the target range of 0-2%. Risks are tilted to the downside. A further escalation of global trade tensions could lead to capital inflows and an appreciation of the Swiss franc, as investors seek safe havens, which could weaken export growth even further. Slower implementation of planned investments in Germany could also weigh on exports. Streamlining regulatory processes would help boosting investment Further reductions in administrative burdens on firms could help to support investment, for example by expanding the government one-stop-shop to incorporate cantonal services. Relaxing foreign equity restrictions could attract more inward foreign direct investment. Reaching climate neutrality hinges on increasing electrification, which will require extensive investment in low-carbon energy sources. Speeding up planning and authorisation procedures for building renewable power plants would support this process. Improving the congested power grid will require streamlining licensing procedures and reducing approval times for transmission line and distribution network projects. 258  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Thailand Real GDP growth is projected to decrease to 2.0% in 2025 from 2.5% in 2024. Export growth will decline with impulse from front-loading ahead of US tariffs being overtaken by their negative effects on trade, investment, incomes and consumption. A recovery in domestic demand will lift growth in 2026 to 2.4%. Price inflation will remain below the 2% centre of the inflation target range. The impacts and uncertainties in global tariff policies are the most prominent risk to the outlook. Fiscal consolidation is needed to reduce the public debt burden while also strengthening support for vulnerable groups. Monetary policy should stand ready to make further interest-rate cuts in the event of weak inflation and further deterioration in growth. Boosting efficient and competitive markets through lean regulation, effective competition policy and better resource allocation, including by reducing informal economic activity, are key priorities for raising long-term growth potential and investment. The economy is weakening Thailand’s domestic demand has been flagging. The economy grew by 0.7% (non-annualised) in the first quarter of 2025. However, investment declined. Meanwhile, trade was supported by front-loading of exports ahead of US trade tariffs; merchandise export values in March rose by 18% year-on-year. Consumer confidence improved between October and January but has since reversed. Business sentiment was also showing some improvement but has recently dipped. Headline inflation has risen from the lows of 2024 reaching 1.1% (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2025, slightly above the lower bound of the target band of 1-3%.

Thailand’s goods exports to the United States represent about 15% of GDP in value terms. In addition to direct exports to the United States, Thailand’s manufacturing exports feed into supply chains linked to Chinese exports. However, the manufacturing sector also potentially has capacity to substitute for Chinese US-bound exports. Monetary policy is easing and fiscal deficits are widening The Bank of Thailand has reduced its policy rate by 75 basis points in recent months. The latest cut, made in April 2025, brought the rate to 1.75% and reflected a response to the worsening outlook for output growth amid continuing low price inflation. The Bank’s support for economic activity is welcome given the diminished scope for bolstering the economy through fiscal policy measures. One more rate cut is envisaged in the context of the central projection. Further rate cuts, if needed, should remain firmly rooted in a data-dependent and independent approach. The public debt burden is elevated and continues to increase. Outstanding government debt amounted to 64.4% of GDP as of end-March, around 20 percentage points above pre-pandemic levels. The fiscal deficit is being widened by the government’s cash handout scheme. Disbursements of a first tranche of transfers to households, began in October 2024. A slight narrowing of the budget deficit in 2026 will slow growth in the public debt burden. Output growth will slow in 2025 Output growth in 2025 is expected to be lower than in 2024, at 2.0%. Negative effects from international trade policy developments will emerge in household consumption, investment and trade. In 2026, recovery in domestic demand and trade as the tariff impacts tail off will lift output growth to 2.4%. These developments will be echoed in the labour market. Inflation will increase gradually during 2025 and 2026. Uncertainties around international trade polices dominate the risk profile.

Reducing entry barriers and strengthening the competition authority will also boost investment and productivity, along with further improvements in public integrity. Growth potential and investment would also be enhanced by a further shift away from low-productivity, informal economic activity. Mobilising additional fiscal revenue would help fund spending pressures from mounting social demands, population ageing and the green transition. Improving the coverage, co-ordination and targeting of social benefits, including basic pensions, and raising benefit levels, would allow further reductions in inequality and poverty, creating better opportunities for all.  261 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Türkiye Output is expected to grow by 2.9% in 2025 and 3.3% in 2026. Tighter financial conditions and fiscal consolidation are moderating household consumption. Private investment and export growth will slow in 2025 due to weaker trade, before picking up gradually in 2026. Inflation is projected to decline substantially thanks to tight monetary policy and decline to around 15% by the end of 2026. However, upside risks to inflation remain significant and the impact of developments in international trade is uncertain. Fiscal and monetary policies should remain contractionary to ensure inflation remains firmly on a downward path. In 2026, lower inflation will allow the monetary policy stance to become less restrictive, bolstering growth. Structural reforms, notably in the labour market and in competition policy, can support macroeconomic stabilisation and raise long-term growth potential. Data point to a continued slowdown in growth Growth slowed from 5.1% in 2023 to 3.2% in 2024 as the economy rebalanced away from its previous overreliance on domestic consumption towards a stronger contribution of net exports. Tight financial conditions weighed on domestic demand, causing a sharp growth slowdown in household spending and investment. Consumption and investment strengthened markedly in late 2024, but it is still unclear if this marks a turnaround. Furthermore, leading indicators, including the purchasing managers index and manufacturing capacity utilisation, continue to decline, pointing to weaker output growth. By contrast, job creation has been solid, with unemployment remaining on the downward trend seen since the pandemic. Inflation has fallen sharply from 75% in May 2024 to 38% in April 2025, although inflation remains visible in housing and education; inflation expectations also remain high.

Uncertainty about global trade should affect the economy mostly through indirect channels as some of the country’s export sectors are likely to be affected by a potential slowdown in European demand. While Türkiye’s exports of goods to the United States are subject to the 10% universal tariff, they only account for about 6% of exports and 1% of GDP. Furthermore, Türkiye has been subject to US tariffs on steel and aluminium since 2018, and is hence less affected by the new 25% rate on all countries. Monetary and fiscal policy will remain contractionary Both fiscal and monetary policies have contributed decisively to the recent decline in inflation. The fiscal deficit is expected to decline from 4.9% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026. This consolidation will be driven by lower levels of capital and transfer expenditures, along with improved revenue performance. The size of the consolidation is likely to be smaller than previously expected due to trade uncertainties and lower growth prospects. The sharp increase in the monetary policy rate is continuing to bring down inflation. The policy rate was raised again to 46% on 17 April, amidst global trade uncertainty and pressure on the Turkish Lira. As inflation decreases further and uncertainty dissipates, space for some gradual easing will eventually emerge. The policy rate is expected to reach 25% by the end of 2026, absent a marked resurgence of global trade and financial tensions or renewed inflationary pressures. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Türkiye Current prices TRY billion GDP at market prices 7 256.1 5.3 5.1 3.2 2.9 3.3 Private consumption 4 008.7 18.5 13.5 3.8 2.3 2.9 Government consumption 939.3 4.3 2.5 0.8 1.5 2.3 Gross fixed capital formation 2 044.2 1.3 8.4 3.9 3.1 4.5 Final domestic demand 6 992.2 11.3 10.6 3.3 2.5 3.3 Stockbuilding¹ 234.5 -5.5 0.7 -2.3 0.2 0.0 Total domestic demand 7 226.8 4.8 10.6 1.4 2.8 3.5 Exports of goods and services 2 593.6 9.9 -2.8 0.9 0.5 2.8 Imports of goods and services 2 564.2 8.6 11.8 -4.1 0.3 3.4 Net exports¹ 29.4 0.5 -6.1 1.7 0.1 -0.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 96.5 68.3 58.4 30.9 20.0 Potential GDP, volume _ 4.4 4.4 4.1 4.1 4.1 Consumer price index² _ 72.3 53.9 58.5 31.4 18.5 Core inflation index³ _ 57.3 58.5 59.8 32.3 18.6 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 10.5 9.4 8.7 8.6 8.5 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -2.1 -4.8 -4.9 -3.3 -3.0 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -5.2 -3.4 -0.8 -0.7 -1.0 Percentage changes, volume (2009 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Headline and core inflation are expected to fall from 31% in 2025 to under 19% in 2026, with year-on-year inflation approaching 15% by the last quarter of 2026. As disinflation proceeds, a less contractionary monetary stance is projected to support consumption and investment from the end of 2025 onwards. While exports are expected to accelerate in late 2025 and 2026, this will be more than offset by import growth, and net exports will contribute negatively to GDP growth in 2026. A more persistent slowdown in global trade and European demand could weigh on growth in 2026, while renewed inflationary pressures or foreign exchange tensions would require tighter financial conditions for longer. Macroeconomic stabilisation policies should be sustained The authorities should continue to prioritise the stabilisation of the economy until inflation is firmly on track to meet the target. Alongside current fiscal consolidation efforts, the government should continue to closely monitor risks from contingent liabilities. Ensuring a stable and predictable policy framework would significantly improve investor sentiment and attract international investment. Fostering female labour force participation, enhancing innovation and training policies and efforts to streamline business regulations would raise long-term growth potential and investment. Making permanent labour contracts more flexible and ensuring that minimum wages are affordable for businesses could also promote formal job creation. 264  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 United Kingdom GDP growth is projected to reach 1.3% in 2025 before slowing to 1.0% in 2026, dampened by heightened trade tensions, tighter financial conditions, and elevated uncertainty. Inflationary pressures will initially linger, due to higher import prices and robust wage growth in 2025, but subside over 2026, as spare capacity emerges and the labour market loosens. Substantial debt interest payments will continue to weigh on the fiscal balance and push up public debt. Fiscal prudence is required as the monetary stance is easing gradually. Efforts to rebuild buffers should be stepped up in the face of strongly constrained budgetary policy and substantial downward risks to growth, while productivity-enhancing public investments should be preserved. Continuing to advance supply-side priorities is key, including by delivering on the announced planning reform to support investment, as well as on welfare reform and the ongoing extension of childcare support to promote labour supply. The economy has picked up but faces headwinds Growth strengthened in the first quarter of 2025, reaching 0.7% on a quarter-to-quarter basis according to the first estimate, up from 0.1% in the last quarter of 2024. Credit to the private sector in March increased at its fastest pace since the third quarter of 2022, reflecting the four 25 basis point cuts in Bank Rate since August 2024. But momentum is weakening, with business sentiment rapidly deteriorating. Consumer confidence remains depressed and has declined since the second half of 2024, while retail sales volumes have been volatile, with an uptick in March. Gilt yields have risen significantly in recent months, partly reflecting global developments. The labour market continues to cool, as falling vacancies are bringing the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio back to pre-pandemic levels. Increases in the national minimum wage, in employer social security contributions, and in utility bills kept services price inflation elevated, at 5.4% in the year to April, and maintained substantial domestic price pressures, with CPI inflation at 3.5% over the same period. Survey measures of new export orders have plummeted, as the aggregate effective tariff faced by domestic goods exporters in US markets is estimated to have increased by almost 8 percentage points since the beginning of the year. This reflects new tariffs of 10% on cars up to a tariff-rate quota of 100 000 vehicles, and 10% on all other goods exports to the United States apart from exempted items, such as pharmaceutical products and steel and aluminium, as well as the removal of tariffs on beef, up to a duty\u0002free quota of 13 000 metric tonnes. More than a fifth of UK exports are destined for US markets, but less than a third of these are goods, worth about 2% of GDP. Among these, pharmaceutical products account for about a third, while cars and car parts account for about 20%. No retaliatory tariffs have been announced on imports from the United States, and tariffs have been removed on US ethanol up to a duty\u0002free quota of 1.4 billion litres, and on US beef up to a duty-free quota of 13 000 metric tonnes.  265 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 United Kingdom 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0ru51o The fiscal stance is restrictive as monetary easing continues Bank Rate is projected to be lowered gradually from its current value of 4.25% and reach a terminal value of 3.5% in the second quarter of 2026, as inflation continues to converge towards target and growth slows below potential. The unwinding of the stock of assets held for monetary purposes in the Asset Purchase Facility is assumed to proceed at an unchanged pace, with the GBP 100 billion target for gilt stock reduction over the 12-month period to September 2025 renewed for another year. Fiscal tightening will continue, with consolidation of about 1.2% of potential GDP between 2024 and 2026. To comply with its fiscal rules, the government implemented tax and spending adjustments in the spring statement, including cuts to welfare spending on incapacity of GBP 5 billion (slightly under 0.2% of GDP), and other tax measures of GBP 2 billion. Moreover, defence spending will be increased by GBP 7 billion (a little over 0.2% of GDP), fully funded through cuts in overseas aid. The government deficit will improve substantially, from 6.0% of GDP in 2024 to 5.3% in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026, owing to both consolidation and rising tax receipts, as debt interest spending remains high. Public debt is set to continue rising, reaching 104% of GDP in 2026. With the ongoing fiscal consolidation, tax receipts will keep rising to about 37.5% of GDP by fiscal year 2026-27. Further supply-side reforms, including the overhaul of the National Planning Policy Framework, are expected to increase potential output and could help to lower fiscal pressures in the longer run. Growth will remain modest while public finances are under pressure GDP is projected to grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 1.0% in 2026. Adverse effects from heightened trade tensions and uncertainty on business sentiment and consumer confidence will significantly weigh on growth. The drag on external demand, private consumption, and business investment is projected to more than offset the positive effects of last autumn’s budgetary measures on government consumption and investment. Higher import prices will slow the disinflation process in 2025, before the emergence of spare  267 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 capacity and the loosening of the labour market create downward pressure in 2026. Unemployment is expected to increase moderately to 4.6%. The state of the public finances is a significant downside risk to the outlook if the fiscal rules are to be met. Currently very thin fiscal buffers could be insufficient to provide adequate support without breaching the fiscal rules in the event of renewed adverse shocks. Elevated services price inflation constitutes another downside risk, as it could require the monetary stance to remain tighter for longer. Relatively high excess savings are an upside risk to private consumption and housing investment. Continuing to rebuild fiscal buffers and to focus on the supply side is essential Strengthening the public finances remains a priority, by delivering on the government’s ambitious fiscal plans, including through the upcoming spending review. A balanced approach should combine targeted spending cuts, including closing tax loopholes; revenue-raising measures such as re-evaluating council tax bands based on updated property values; and the removal of distortions in the tax system. To boost investment and revive productivity growth, it is necessary to deliver on the planned overhaul of the National Planning Policy Framework to unlock infrastructure projects and housing development. To reverse the decline in labour market participation, swiftly implementing pro-work reforms to the welfare state is key, while protecting the most vulnerable. Proceeding with the ongoing reform of childcare support, including by addressing potential bottlenecks and prioritising low-income households if childcare supply falls short of demand, is required to continue promoting female labour market participation. 268  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 United States Growth is expected to slow markedly to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. This reflects the substantial increase in the effective tariff rate on imports and retaliation from some trading partners, high economic policy uncertainty, a significant slowdown in net immigration, and a sizeable reduction in the federal workforce. Annual headline inflation is set to pick up to 3.9% by end-2025 due to higher import prices but is expected to ease throughout 2026, aided by moderate GDP growth and higher unemployment. Risks to the growth projection are skewed to the downside, including a more substantial slowing of economic activity in the face of policy uncertainty, greater-than-expected upward pressure on prices from tariff increases, and large financial market corrections. Further easing of monetary policy will be warranted once inflation begins to abate and so long as inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Large budget deficits are expected for a sustained period, contributing to a high and rising government debt-to-GDP ratio. A significant fiscal adjustment will be required over several years. To ensure sustained growth and resilience, further efforts are needed to resolve trade tensions with international partners and reduce policy uncertainty. The economic outlook has deteriorated GDP grew at a robust pace of 2.8% in 2024, driven largely by private consumption and government spending, while further progress was made on disinflation. Although the advance estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025 was negative, this weakness likely reflected distortions from announced and anticipated actions on tariffs. Incoming hard data have generally indicated that the US economy began the year with considerable momentum. Final private demand remained resilient in the first quarter, monthly payroll growth averaged about 145 000 through the first four months of the year, and the unemployment rate remained low at 4.2%. By contrast, recent soft data indicators, such as surveys of consumer and business sentiment and inflation expectations, suggest a notable cooling of real GDP growth and a significant increase in inflation expectations. Measures of economic policy uncertainty have soared, and equity and bond markets have been characterised by elevated uncertainty and volatility. Meanwhile, inflation has proven sticky over recent quarters, with annual headline inflation remaining about 0.5 percentage point above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% through the first quarter of 2025. There has been a significant shift in US trade policy since February through a wide range of announcements regarding new tariffs and other trade restrictions, some of which have been reversed, delayed or modified, together with retaliation by some trading partners. A technical assumption is made that the tariffs prevailing as of mid-May will remain in place through the rest of 2025 and in 2026. Since the start of the year, the effective tariff rate on Chinese imports has risen by about 30%, while the effective tariff rate on other trading partners has risen to around 10%, on average. This represents an unprecedented increase in the average effective tariff rate, raising it from about 2.5% to above 15%, the highest rate since World War II. While the new tariffs may increase incentives to produce in the United States, higher import prices will reduce real incomes for consumers and raise the price of imported intermediate goods. Tariffs and policy uncertainty disrupt value chains and negatively affect investment. Border encounters between US Customs and Border Protection officials and illegal entrants to the United States, a proxy for net immigration, have fallen sharply over the past year from their previously elevated levels and are now well below pre-pandemic levels, when net immigration averaged about 1 million annually. Slower net immigration will contribute to lower growth in both supply and demand.  269 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 United States 1 1. Year-on-year percentage changes. 2.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/hwgc08 The large budget deficit will expand further, while monetary policy easing will be on hold this year The budget deficit on a general government basis is expected to rise from around 7½ per cent of GDP in 2024 to over 8% in 2026, with the net debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 100% by end-2026. New tariff revenues and spending cuts resulting from the shrinking of the federal workforce will be deficit-reducing. However, these effects will be more than offset by a slowing in revenue growth from weaker economic activity, as well as the expected enactment of a fiscal package for fiscal year 2026 and beyond that would extend the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, make additional personal and corporate income tax cuts and boost spending on border security, while making further spending cuts, primarily related to health care. This fiscal package is responsible for most of the projected 0.6 percentage point of GDP rise in the deficit in 2026. Monetary policy easing, which began in the third quarter of 2024, is likely to be on hold throughout 2025 given that inflation, already somewhat above target, is projected to move higher this year. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to wait to see renewed progress towards its inflation mandate, even in a context of slowing growth. As long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, monetary policy easing should resume in 2026 with a cumulative 100 basis point cut in the policy rate, bringing it to 3¼-3½ per cent by end-2026. GDP growth is set to slow and risks are skewed to the downside Real GDP growth is expected to slow significantly from its 2024 pace. The substantial increase in the effective tariff rate on US imports and elevated policy uncertainty will dent household consumption and business investment growth. Both export and import growth will slow because of tighter trade policies and weaker demand, but the impact on imports will be greater than that on exports given the asymmetry in the change in tariffs, leading to a modest reduction in the current account deficit. With slower aggregate demand growth, the unemployment rate is projected to rise to 4.4% in early 2026, with the increase mitigated by the immigration slowdown. Annual headline inflation is expected to increase sharply to 3.9%  271 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 by the end of 2025 as the tariffs are implemented and passed onto consumers. Inflation should then fall rapidly in 2026 as the upward impact of the tariff increases on the price level drops out and sluggish growth mitigates second-round effects. Risks to growth are skewed to the downside. These include a more pronounced slowing of household consumption and investment due to elevated policy uncertainty and resulting financial market corrections. Monetary policy easing may be derailed should inflation expectations become de-anchored due to greater\u0002than-expected upward pressure on prices, leading to higher interest rates than assumed. A key upside risk is that the tariff increases are unwound further. In addition, the economy could prove more resilient to the tariff shock than expected, especially if less of the tariff increase is passed on to the final consumer than is usually found to be the case. Deregulation of key sectors of the economy and new advances in artificial intelligence could also provide a boost to growth. A resolution of trade tensions and a reduction in policy uncertainty are needed To ensure sustained growth and resilience, it will be important to mitigate the disruption and uncertainty now prevailing. One key step is to resolve tensions with international trading partners. Any cuts to federal spending and the federal workforce should be well-targeted and not threaten the delivery of vital government services and research programmes. Reforms to immigration policy should be mindful of potential disruption in important sectors of the economy, such as construction and agriculture. The large structural budget deficit and rising debt ratio increase fiscal risks. A significant fiscal adjustment will be required over several years to help mitigate these risks, which would be supported by a solid medium-term fiscal framework. Strengthened competition policies and antitrust enforcement in concentrated industries with high prices, such as telecommunications, could also increase business investment, innovation, and overall economic growth. Other areas for improvement include simplifying the administrative and regulatory burden on business, as well as streamlining the licensing system for starting new firms. More generally, policymaking should be clear, predictable, and consistent to minimise the negative effects of policy uncertainty on economic activity and, in particular, on investment. 272  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1 © OECD 2025 Viet Nam GDP growth is projected to slow to 6.2% in 2025 and 6.0% in 2026, as global policy uncertainty dampens foreign investment and exports. Private consumption will remain buoyant amid rising real wages. Planned increases in public investment will support domestic investment, but foreign investment inflows are expected to weaken. Inflation is projected to pick up. As a trade-dependent economy, Viet Nam remains highly exposed to external developments. The monetary policy stance is expected to remain accommodative, but vigilance is needed amid emerging inflationary pressures. Fiscal policy is expected to support growth in 2025 by working off a past backlog of public investment projects but should eventually turn more neutral. Improvements in the macroeconomic policy framework and financial sector reforms could improve resource allocation and bolster growth, while a more comprehensive social protection system could improve resilience to shocks. An accelerated rollout of renewable energy sources in the power sector could make growth more sustainable. Activity has been strong GDP increased by 7.1% in 2024, after moderate growth of 5.1% in 2023. Final consumption, gross capital formation and exports of goods and services all contributed to the steady expansion. Unemployment has fallen to a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025, the underemployment rate has fallen, and labour force participation has risen. Headline inflation has declined from its recent peak of 4.4% in May 2024, reaching 3.1% in April 2025. Core inflation fell to 2.5% in September 2024 but has since picked up again.

This makes Viet Nam vulnerable to higher US import tariffs, which are currently 10% but could rise to 46%. Exports to China, Viet Nam’s second largest export market, were essentially flat in 2024. These trends continued in the first three months of 2025. Foreign direct investment has been a driver of growth and increased since mid-2024. Macroeconomic policies could become more neutral if inflation rises Fiscal policy will continue to support growth through increased public investment in the near term, as the government seeks to make up for past undershooting of investment plans. Emerging inflationary pressures, however, would eventually suggest moving from an accommodative fiscal stance towards a more neutral one. The central bank has maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance since June 2023, using both interest rate cuts and direct credit growth targets for banks. This stance is expected to continue. With a robust recovery underway, the focus should be on closely monitoring inflation risks that could arise from increases in pensions and the minimum wage, as well as expected increases in administrative prices, and monetary policy should stand ready to tighten if needed. Growth is projected to weaken GDP is projected to increase by 6.2% in 2025 and 6% in 2026 on the back of domestic demand, while export demand and foreign direct investment inflows will be weaker until policy uncertainty dissipates. Private consumption will be supported by continued increases in real wages and employment, with investment buoyed by accelerated public investment disbursements. Inflation is projected to rise due to strong domestic demand, and there is a risk that these inflationary pressures turn out stronger than 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Viet Nam Current prices VND trillion GDP at market prices 8 487.5 8.5 5.1 7.1 6.2 6.0 Private consumption 4 712.2 7.9 3.4 6.7 6.5 6.2 Government consumption 813.5 3.0 4.6 5.8 5.4 5.3 Gross fixed capital formation 2 634.1 5.9 4.6 7.1 7.6 8.0 Final domestic demand 8 159.8 6.7 3.9 6.8 6.8 6.7 Stockbuilding¹ 240.7 -0.8 -0.8 0.9 0.7 0.0 Total domestic demand² 8 400.5 5.7 3.1 7.6 7.4 6.6 Exports of goods and services 7 965.5 4.0 -2.5 15.5 8.0 5.4 Imports of goods and services 7 878.6 1.5 -4.5 16.1 9.3 6.0 Net exports¹ 87.0 2.6 2.0 -0.4 -1.2 -0.7 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 4.4 2.1 4.2 4.2 3.3 Consumer price index _ 3.2 3.3 3.6 3.7 3.8 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -0.3 5.8 5.7 4.2 3.8 Percentage changes, volume (2010 prices) 1.

As foreign direct investment and exports have been Viet Nam’s principal growth engines, higher trade barriers and continued policy uncertainty constitute major downside risks to the outlook. If trade barriers in export markets diminish Viet Nam’s attractiveness as an investment destination, growth could weaken substantially. Structural reforms would strengthen investment, social protection and sustainability Reducing barriers to foreign ownership in services sectors would promote continued inflows of foreign direct investment. Social benefits, including old-age pensions, remain patchy amid widespread labour informality. Well-coordinated reforms to expand non-contributory social assistance benefits while maintaining strong incentives for formal job creation would support both resilience to shocks and productivity. Reducing emissions from electricity generation by phasing out coal-fired plants and accelerating the rollout of renewable energy sources will be key for more sustainable growth. Foreign\u0002owned firms have been a driver of growth but have developed few supplier links to local firms. More investment in tertiary education could foster these links and strengthen productivity, combined with stronger competition in services sectors and a more even playing field between private and state-owned companies. OECD Economic Outlook Tackling Uncertainty, Reviving Growth June 2025 Volume 2025/1, No. 117 The global outlook is becoming increasingly challenging. Substantial increases in barriers to trade and heightened policy uncertainty will have marked adverse effects on growth prospects if they persist. On the assumption that tariff rates as of mid‑May are sustained, global GDP growth is projected to slow notably this year and to remain subdued in 2026. Growth could be even weaker if there are additional increases in trade barriers and policy uncertainty. Inflationary pressures could be stronger than expected due to higher trade costs and rising inflation expectations, prompting more restrictive monetary policy and repricing in financial markets. On the upside, a reversal of the recent increase in trade barriers, steps to reduce regulatory burdens or an early resolution of geopolitical conflicts could have positive impacts on global growth. The key policy priorities are to ensure a lasting decline in policy uncertainty, trade tensions and inflation, establish a credible fiscal path to debt sustainability while providing temporary support to those vulnerable to economic shocks, and implement ambitious reforms to strengthen growth prospects and investment. This issue includes an assessment of the global economic situation, a chapter on investment and a chapter summarising developments and providing projections for each individual country. Coverage is provided for all OECD members as well as for selected partner economies. 9HSTCQE*dehdgg+ PRINT ISBN 978-92-64-34736-6 PDF ISBN 978-92-64-87597-5",

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Ashley, ‘How the Spectre of Hindutva Captured Politics in Kerala,’ The Wire, 30 October 2020](https://thewire.in/politics/kerala-elections-hindutva-muslims) The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

When was NDMA constituted?](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/www.vajiramandravi.com#q2-when-was-ndma-constituted) ## **What’s in today’s article?** - Background - Key Events in 2023 - India’s Unique Vulnerabilities - Earthquake Risks - Challenges in Resilience and Insurance - Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach - Conclusion ## **Background** - India has witnessed a sharp rise in economic losses due to natural catastrophes, reflecting both the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and the country’s vulnerabilities. - In 2023, natural disasters caused an estimated **$12 billion** in economic losses, significantly exceeding the annual average of **$8 billion** over the past decade, according to a report by global insurance giant **Swiss Re**. ## **Key Events in 2023** - **Floods in Northern India and Sikkim (July 2023):** - **Affected Areas:** Himachal Pradesh, including Shimla, and Delhi. - **Impact:** Caused extensive damage due to heavy rains between **July 10-15**, disrupting daily life and infrastructure. - **Tropical Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023):** - **Landfall:** Category 3 cyclone struck Kutch, Gujarat, impacting Maharashtra and Rajasthan as well. - **Damage:** Shut down major ports like Kandla and Mundra, causing extensive damage due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. - **Tropical Cyclone Michaung (December 2023):** - **Landfall:** Hit Chennai, Tamil Nadu. - **Impact:** Brought extreme rainfall, resulting in significant economic losses and urban disruption. ## **India’s Unique Vulnerabilities** - **Monsoon-Driven Floods:** - **Contribution to Losses:** Over the past two decades, floods have accounted for an average of **63%** of annual economic losses. - **Monsoon Influence:** India’s geography and climate expose it to heavy rainfall during: - **Summer Monsoon (June-September):** Causes severe flooding, as seen in Kerala (2018) and Uttarakhand (2013). - **Northeast Monsoon (October-December):** Responsible for floods like Chennai (2015). - **Economic and Industrial Exposure:** - States like **Gujarat**, **Maharashtra**, and **Tamil Nadu** are highly industrialized, contributing **36.8%** of India’s total industrial output. These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India’s rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2.

Naxalite ambushes targeting Indian police are common, especially in eastern India, but the April 6 attack was unusually large.

Formed from a 1967 split within the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the insurgency has been responsible for decades of violence throughout eastern and central India’s “Red Corridor.” These loosely affiliated Maoist rebels claim to fight on behalf of the landless poor, virulently opposing the injustice and oppression of the Indian state. In response to attacks on police officers, government officials, and landlords, India has employed an assortment of counterinsurgency strategies that, over the years, have met varied levels of success. As the modern Naxalite movement continues to develop, the Indian government faces new complications related to one of its most destabilizing internal security challenges. Adequately addressing this threat will prove essential in solidifying India’s status as a rising world power, as well as demonstrating its capacity to effectively combat militancy. #### Tags [India](https://csis.org/regions/asia/india),[Defense and Security](https://csis.org/topics/defense-and-security), and[Counterterrorism and Homeland Security](https://csis.org/topics/defense-and-security/counterterrorism-and-homeland-security) ### William Magioncalda",

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India \\[CPI\\]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external security partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of domestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an Indian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime security activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington.

Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade.

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Ajit Doval’s Office Probes Digital Breach at Indira Gandhi Airport SHARE **NEW DELHI:** A suspected GPS spoofing attack that crippled flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport has prompted an investigation by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval’s office. The incident, which briefly grounded major domestic and international carriers, has reignited concerns about India’s aviation safety systems—already flagged by a recent parliamentary committee report as “lagging behind global standards.” Contents [A National Security Probe into the Heart of India’s Aviation System](https://the420.in/the420.in#a-national-security-probe-into-the-heart-of-indias-aviation-system) [Automation Under Stress: The AMSS Breakdown](https://the420.in/the420.in#automation-under-stress-the-amss-breakdown) [Warnings Ignored: A Parliamentary Report’s Stark Findings](https://the420.in/the420.in#warnings-ignored-a-parliamentary-reports-stark-findings) [Global Standards, Local Gaps](https://the420.in/the420.in#global-standards-local-gaps) ### **A National Security Probe into the Heart of India’s Aviation System** The Office of the National Security Advisor (NSA), led by Ajit Doval, has launched a high-level probe into a suspected GPS spoofing attack that disrupted flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport earlier this week. Officials confirmed that the anomaly, which crippled communication and navigation systems under the Airport Management Support System (AMSS), temporarily brought flight movements to a halt. The disruption, which lasted several hours, affected major domestic carriers such as IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air, alongside international airlines including British Airways and Lufthansa. While the issue was resolved within a day, it exposed a critical fault line in India’s aviation security infrastructure—an area increasingly vulnerable to both cyber and technical threats. > [“Centre for Police Technology” Launched as Common Platform for Police, OEMs, and Vendors to Drive Smart Policing](https://the420.in/centre-for-police-technology-launched-as-common-platform-for-police-oems-and-vendors-to-drive-smart-policing/) ### **Automation Under Stress: The AMSS Breakdown** Preliminary findings indicate that the malfunction stemmed from interference in the automated systems managing air traffic coordination and GPS tracking. The AMSS, a core backbone of modern airport operations, synchronizes navigation data, weather inputs, and flight management software. A disruption—whether caused by a cyberattack or a system overload—can cascade rapidly through radar, communication, and control networks. For passengers, the incident translated into chaos on the ground: delayed departures, missed connections, and a sudden breakdown in real-time flight data visibility. For aviation authorities, it underscored a deeper challenge—the growing strain on India’s automation systems as air traffic surges to pre-pandemic highs. ### **Warnings Ignored: A Parliamentary Report’s Stark Findings** The crisis came barely two months after a parliamentary committee issued a prescient warning about “performance degradation” in India’s aviation automation systems. The 380th report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture—tabled on August 20—had flagged slowness, lag, and system inefficiencies at major airports, including Delhi and Mumbai. The committee cautioned that these technical limitations, coupled with outdated air traffic control (ATC) infrastructure, could jeopardize flight safety. It further highlighted chronic staff shortages, rising controller fatigue, and the slow pace of modernization—factors that have collectively pushed India’s aviation systems behind global benchmarks. ### **Global Standards, Local Gaps** India’s aviation sector, one of the fastest-growing in the world, has struggled to align its safety architecture with international standards. While the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has accelerated modernization programs under its Air Navigation Services Roadmap, experts warn that digital vulnerabilities—especially cyber interference like GPS spoofing—represent a new frontier of risk. The Delhi incident, now under the NSA’s scrutiny, marks a critical juncture. It is no longer only about technical resilience but also about national security preparedness in a digital era where the skies are as much about networks as they are about airways.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india).

His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government's announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

Some of the most violent attacks conducted by the Naxalites have been against police transport and freight trains, killing dozens of people at a time. The Naxalites specifically inhabit an area known as the \"Red Corridor,\" which stretches from West Bengal state southwest to Karnataka state. The most violent states in this corridor have been Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. The region is defined by rolling hills covered in dense forest and has few improved roads, which allows the Naxalites to control access. The dense foliage also protects them from government aircraft.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi.

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://frontline.thehindu.com?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ## Stories that help you connect the dots ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

    "full_text": "Bangladesh will likely adopt a more assertive foreign policy, which will likely include strengthening ties with Pakistan while balancing its economic dependencies on India and maintaining cooperation on security and regional stability. On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets, and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama, and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity to lay aside, however briefly, their countries' long-standing differences and focus on topics of mutual concern, such as climate change, food security and natural disasters. Yet one related issue was missing from the agenda: water. If Beijing and New Delhi fail to address the matter, the repercussions for the region, its inhabitants and its environment will likely be devastating....

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....
