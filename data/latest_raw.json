This collision zone is a significant cause of seismic activity in the region. The Himalayas, one of the youngest mountain ranges in the world, are a direct result of this tectonic activity. The northeastern states, the Himalayan region, and parts of the western and southern regions of India are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. ### Notable Earthquakes 1. **2001 Gujarat Earthquake**: A devastating earthquake of magnitude 7.7 hit Gujarat on January 26, 2001, causing extensive damage and loss of life. 2. **2015 Nepal Earthquake**: Although centered in Nepal, this earthquake affected parts of India, especially the northern states, causing significant structural damage and casualties. 3. **2016 Imphal Earthquake**: A 6.7 magnitude earthquake struck Manipur’s capital, Imphal, causing damage to infrastructure and buildings. ### Impacts - **Human Lives**: Earthquakes result in the loss of lives, with thousands affected directly or indirectly. - **Infrastructure**: The destruction of buildings, roads, and bridges leads to economic losses and disrupts daily life. - **Economic Loss**: The financial burden of reconstruction and relief efforts is immense. ### Mitigation Measures - **Seismic Building Codes**: The Indian government has established guidelines for constructing earthquake-resistant buildings. - **Early Warning Systems**: Efforts are ongoing to develop and implement early warning systems to provide timely alerts. - **Public Awareness and Education**: Programs to educate the public on how to respond during an earthquake are crucial. ## Droughts in India ### Causes and Geography Droughts in India are primarily caused by insufficient rainfall, often linked to the failure of the monsoon. The country’s reliance on the monsoon for agriculture makes it particularly vulnerable to droughts. Regions such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and parts of Karnataka are frequently affected. ### Notable Droughts 1. **1965-66 Drought**: A severe drought affected large parts of India, leading to food shortages and economic challenges. 2. **2002-03 Drought**: This drought impacted agriculture, leading to a decline in crop production and affecting the livelihoods of millions. ### Impacts - **Agriculture**: Reduced rainfall affects crop yields, leading to food shortages and increased prices. - **Water Scarcity**: Droughts exacerbate water scarcity issues, affecting drinking water supplies and irrigation. - **Economic Strain**: The agricultural sector’s struggles during droughts have a ripple effect on the economy. ### Mitigation Measures - **Irrigation Projects**: The government has initiated several irrigation projects to ensure water availability during dry periods. - **Rainwater Harvesting**: Promoting rainwater harvesting can help mitigate the effects of drought. - **Drought-Resistant Crops**: Research and development of drought-resistant crop varieties are crucial for ensuring food security. ## Floods in India ### Causes and Geography Floods in India are often caused by excessive rainfall, river overflow, and poor drainage systems. The monsoon season, spanning from June to September, brings heavy rains that can lead to flooding. Major river systems, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and their tributaries, are prone to overflowing, particularly in northern and eastern India. ### Notable Floods 1. **2013 Uttarakhand Floods**: Caused by unprecedented rainfall, these floods resulted in significant loss of life and property, particularly in the pilgrimage town of Kedarnath. 2. **2018 Kerala Floods**: Torrential rains led to widespread flooding in Kerala, displacing thousands and causing extensive damage. ### Impacts - **Loss of Life and Property**: Floods cause casualties and destroy homes, businesses, and infrastructure. - **Public Health**: Stagnant water and poor sanitation during floods can lead to waterborne diseases. - **Economic Losses**: The cost of relief and reconstruction after floods is a significant economic burden. ### Mitigation Measures - **Flood Forecasting**: The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) provides forecasts and warnings to help prepare for potential floods. - **Embankments and Dams**: Constructing embankments and dams can help control river flow and reduce flood risks. - **Disaster Management Plans**: Implementing comprehensive disaster management plans at the local and national levels is essential for effective response and recovery. ## Cyclones in India ### Causes and Geography India’s long coastline, spanning over 7,500 kilometers, makes it vulnerable to cyclones, particularly along the eastern coast in the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones form due to low-pressure systems over warm ocean waters and can bring strong winds, heavy rains, and storm surges. ### Notable Cyclones 1. **1999 Odisha Cyclone**: One of the most powerful cyclones to hit India, it caused massive destruction and loss of life. 2. **Cyclone Fani (2019)**: This severe cyclone affected Odisha and West Bengal, causing widespread damage. ### Impacts - **Human Casualties**: Cyclones can lead to significant loss of life, especially in coastal areas. - **Infrastructure Damage**: High winds and storm surges can destroy buildings, roads, and power lines. - **Agricultural Losses**: Cyclones often devastate crops, leading to food shortages and economic loss. ### Mitigation Measures - **Cyclone Warning Systems**: The IMD issues cyclone warnings to help people evacuate and prepare. - **Coastal Defenses**: Building seawalls and storm surge barriers can help protect coastal areas. - **Evacuation Plans**: Developing and implementing efficient evacuation plans is crucial for saving lives. ## Tsunamis in India ### Causes and Geography Tsunamis are large ocean waves generated by underwater seismic activity, such as earthquakes. India’s eastern coastline and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are particularly vulnerable to tsunamis due to their proximity to tectonic plate boundaries. ### Notable Tsunamis 1. **2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami**: Triggered by a massive undersea earthquake, this tsunami devastated the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. ### Impacts - **Loss of Life**: Tsunamis can cause widespread fatalities, especially in coastal areas. - **Infrastructure Damage**: The massive waves can destroy buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. - **Environmental Impact**: Tsunamis can lead to long-term changes in coastal landscapes and ecosystems. ### Mitigation Measures - **Tsunami Warning Systems**: India has established a tsunami warning system to provide early alerts. - **Public Education**: Raising awareness about the risks and safety measures associated with tsunamis is vital. - **Coastal Zone Management**: Implementing policies to manage coastal zones and prevent construction in high-risk areas can reduce the impact of tsunamis. ## Tables and Data ### Table 1: Major Earthquakes in India | Year | Location | Magnitude | Deaths | Description | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 2001 | Gujarat | 7.7 | 20,000+ | Massive destruction in Bhuj and surrounding areas | | 2015 | Nepal (Affected India) | 7.8 | 8,964 | Significant damage in northern India | | 2016 | Imphal, Manipur | 6.7 | 11 | Infrastructure damage in the capital city | * * * ### Table 2: Major Floods in India | Year | Location | Affected Area | Deaths | Description | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 2013 | Uttarakhand | Kedarnath, Surrounding areas | 5,700+ | Floods caused by cloudburst and glacial meltdown | | 2018 | Kerala | Entire state | 483 | Unprecedented rainfall leading to massive displacement | * * * ### Table 3: Major Cyclones in India | Year | Name | Location | Category | Deaths | Description | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 1999 | Odisha Cyclone | Odisha | 5 | 9,658 | One of the deadliest cyclones in Indian history | | 2019 | Fani | Odisha | 4 | 89 | Severe cyclonic storm causing widespread damage | * * * ## List of Points: Key Mitigation Measures 1. **Seismic Building Codes**: Ensure buildings are constructed to withstand earthquakes. 2. **Early Warning Systems**: Implement for earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and tsunamis. 3. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Educate the public on disaster preparedness and response. 4. **Disaster Management Plans**: Develop and regularly update plans for all types of disasters. 5. **Infrastructure Development**: Invest in resilient infrastructure that can withstand natural disasters. ## Conclusion India’s geographical diversity exposes it to a range of natural disasters, including earthquakes, droughts, floods, cyclones, and tsunamis.

Previously, 28 people from the district worked in the Maoist party and their number has come down now because of the efforts being made by the State Government and Bhadradri Kothagudem Police to wean away Maoist’s influence in the district. The family members of the underground Maoists have to take the responsibility of encouraging the Maoists to surrender for leading a normal life. The government provides support for the rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists, the SP said, adding that the Maoist leaders were terrorising innocent tribals and forcing them to join the banned Maoist party to engage them in illegal activities for their selfish interests.

In a statement, ASP Pankaj said, Maoists were committing criminal offences to show their presence and harassing the innocent tribal people of the agency areas. The Naxals \\[Left Wing extremists, LWEs\\] have become obstacles to development. The top leaders of the Maoist party were compelling their lower-level cadres to commit illegal activities with the aim of extorting money and troubling innocent tribals in many ways for their selfish interests. Minor boys and girls were being tortured by the Naxals forcing them to join the Maoist party. The ASP noted that many cadres attracted by the ‘Operation Chayutha’ are planning to surrender, but they were being prevented doing so by Maoist top leadership. **Read less...** | | May - 11 | Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today.

For the selfish needs of Maoists, the lives of Adivasi boys and girls were being spoiled as they were deprived of education. Maoists like Sodi Jogaiah, Rajesh, Sodi Mada and others, killed in encounters, were made to join the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] when they were minor in age and the party top leadership should take responsibility for their deaths, the SP said.

Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas. The Maoists are also developing drones to carry and drop up to five kilograms of explosives on Police Stations. In the latest issue of their mouthpiece, the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] claim to have well responded to the aerial attacks and surveillance in Chhattisgarh with their counter strategy. **Read less...** | | July - 15 | To choke the flow of funds to Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists (LWEs)\\] in the state, the Bihar Police has intensified its crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts, reports Deccan Herald on July 16.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger. The STF and Central forces have confined them there.

In a press note issued on November 23, the OSD reminded people that Maoists had issued a statement urging the people to boycott the impending Assembly elections slated for November 30. He, however, reassured the public of the foolproof security arrangements in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections. The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#content) Author ### [Pearl Pandya](https://acleddata.com/staff/pearl-pandya) South Asia Research Manager _On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOorD5qivlKr2EDLlPurrKrB1Tr759R_oZtMzJq_UPkH-xwZw139I#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

    "title": "Weaponizing Markets: India’s Naxalite Insurgency",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future.

India has seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks over the last few years, which has turned data protection into a top security concern. According to **CERT-IN,** between **2021 and mid-2025,** India recorded more than **2.2 million** cybersecurity incidents, averaging more than **3,000 attacks per day,** with financial services, healthcare, telecom, and government platforms among the hardest hit. Hackers focused on cloud misconfigurations, unpatched servers, and weak internal access controls. The list below tracks **25 major cyberattacks in India** from 2021 to 2025, showing how they happened and what strategies can be used to prevent similar breaches. ## **1\\. Angel One AWS resource breach/potential data leakage, February 2025** Angel One, India's largest broking firm, was recently hacked. Hackers gained access to an unsecured AWS storage bucket linked to it, exposing the sensitive data of **7.9 million** users, such as trading details, email addresses, and customer IDs. Cloud management made sensitive data visible on public servers. To avoid such scams, similar companies must audit all cloud buckets, enable encryption, and always restrict public access through IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules. ## **2\\. AI-generated Phishing and Infostealer Surge, 2025** In 2025, several Indian banks and fintech platforms reported a rise in AI-generated phishing scams. Attackers used a realistic, AI-written email to fool users into giving away credentials. Thousands have already fallen victim to these smarter phishing campaigns by unknowingly entering their bank credentials, leading to financial losses and identity theft. Attackers also used voice cloning and deepfake technology to impersonate officials, which makes the deception look more convincing. One must consider the fact that constant user training, spam filters, and AI-based email scanning tools block most phishing messages before they reach inboxes. ## **3\\. Aditya Birla Capital Digital (ABCD) App Hack, 2025** Hackers targeted a weakness in the ABCD mobile app API, revealing customers' loan and PAN details. The attackers targeted unprotected endpoints, which allows data scraping. API vulnerabilities remain a growing concern for finance apps. However, routine code audits with secure token validation and regular app updates can stop such data exposure. ## **4\\. Star Health Threats, May 2025** Star Health, one of India's largest health insurers, experienced a major data breach that affected 31 million policyholders; much of the core information, including medical records, insurance details, and personal information, was breached and even published on the dark web. This breach shows how healthcare data can be exploited for identity theft. Encrypting health records, segmenting sensitive systems, and ensuring continuous monitoring can reduce such risks. ## **5\\. Delhi Hospitals Ransomware Attack, June 2025** Delhi's **Sant Parmanand** and **NKS Super Speciality** hospitals were targeted by ransomware that locked almost all patient and billing data. Over **60,000 records** were affected by this attack. The attack used phishing emails to deliver ransomware payloads. The malware spread quickly through unprotected hospital networks. Hospitals should isolate administrative and patient data systems, train staff to identify suspicious emails, and maintain offline data backups. ## **6\\. Kolkata Police Cyber Crime Wing Data Breach, August 2025** Weak internal passwords and a lack of access control allowed hackers to access internal police systems, where investigation details from the Cyber Wing in Kolkata were leaked. This breach exposed officer credentials and case data. The attack raised alarms about insider threats and the need for stronger law enforcement cybersecurity. Police and law enforcement agencies should adopt role-based access control, enforce password rotations, and enable two-factor authentication for internal systems. ## **7\\. Multiple Cyberattacks on Indian Governments, 2024.** Multiple state e-governance portals were hacked in 2024, leaking citizen Aadhaar and bank details. At least **2.5 million** records were compromised across several platforms. Many portals lacked basic HTTPS encryption, which allowed attackers to exploit outdated plugins and weak admin passwords. That's why regular CMS updates, secure admin logins, and government-wide cybersecurity policies are vital for protection. Every e-governance platform must undergo quarterly vulnerability assessments and follow a national cybersecurity standard to protect public data. ## **8\\. Polycab Ransomware Attack, March 2024** Polycab India, a top cable manufacturer, suffered a ransomware attack, causing a **Rs 20 crore** operational loss. The breach started from an infected employee workstation and ended with hackers encrypting internal files and demanding high payments. The attack also affected the supplier and distributor network, exposing the ripple effect of industrial cyber incidents. ## **9\\. Indian Energy Sector Attack, 2024** This breach shows the exposure of operational technology systems, where hackers tried to infiltrate India's power grid through malware-infected email attachments sent to energy employees. The attack aimed to disrupt the electricity supply but was quickly contained. **Tip:** Separating IT and OT networks and constantly monitoring power infrastructure can prevent major outages like this. Moreover, conducting red team simulations and regular cybersecurity drills helps reduce the chance of large-scale blackouts. ## **10\\. BSNL Data Breach, May 2024** Personal details of **2.9 million** broadband subscribers were leaked from a BSNL database due to old, unpatched systems. Leaked data included phone numbers and service details. The breach came from a neglected internal server. The outdated system, left without proper monitoring, became an easy entry point. Updating infrastructure and restricting admin access can prevent similar service providers. **Read Also: [Top 30 Best-Known Cybersecurity Case Studies 2025](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-best-known-cybersecurity-case-studies)** ## **11\\. UP Marriage Assistance Scheme Leak, 2024** The Uttar Pradesh Marriage Assistance Scheme is a welfare initiative aimed at helping low-income families. Data from the welfare portal of Uttar Pradesh leaked, including Aadhaar, bank details, and contact information, affecting **200,000** applicants. The data was found indexed on search engines, shockingly. The root cause was traced to poor web server configuration and missing access restrictions. A web firewall and regular penetration testing could have prevented this from happening. ## **12\\. Airtel India Customer Database Leak (375 Million Users), June 2024** Hackers claimed to sell a database of **375 million** users, which would be nearly **25%** of India's population. Airtel denied the break, but the data was widely shared online. The leak included Aadhaar numbers and personal details. Even if false, it revealed risks from third-party data handling. Telecom companies must run vendor audits and apply zero-trust security across all databases, anonymising customer data wherever possible to reduce exposure if leaks occur. ## **13\\. WazirX Hack, July 2024** Crypto firms must use cold wallets for storage and conduct third-party code audits before deploying smart contracts. WazirX, a crypto exchange, was targeted by hackers who were exploiting blockchain smart contract vulnerabilities. Roughly **$230 million** worth of assets were at risk. This breach clearly highlights that public blockchain code, if left unaudited, can create hidden backdoors. ## **14\\. boAt India Data Breach, 2023** Encrypting user data and applying hashed passwords are key to securing e-commerce databases. In 2023, an unsecured server was recently exposed, exposing **7.5 million** customer records, including names and contact information. The leak spread on Telegram and hacking forums. Weak password protection made recovery even harder. Many users later reported spam calls and targeted ads due to leaked data. ## **15\\. Telangana Police's Hawk Eye App Data Breach, 2023** Hackers accessed the Hawk Eye mobile app, revealing user profiles and feedback reports. The app, meant for citizen safety, accidentally exposed personal data through a misconfigured API. Public-facing government apps should use token-based access, secure API gateways and regular security reviews before each software update. **Read Also: [Top 50 Cyber Security Projects for Final Year Students (2025 Edition)](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-25-cyber-security-projects-for-final-year-students)** ## **16\\. Hyundai Motor India Data Leak, 2023** Thousands of car owners whose contact and vehicle details were stolen were found on the dark web. The source of the breach was traced to a third-party vendor responsible for managing the dealer's database. Weak vendor access controls and outdated security measures worsened the system, risking identity misuse because the data appeared on dark web forums for sale. ## **17\\. SPARSH Data Breach, 2023** The Ministry of Defence's SPARSH portal suffered a breach, which exposed pensioner IDs and bank details. Hackers used credential stuffing techniques on weak passwords. This breach raised national security concerns as the portal handled sensitive military data. Multi-factor authentication, stronger password policies, and regular login behaviour analysis can stop similar attacks. ## **18\\. Sun Pharma Cyber Attack, 2023** Pharmaceutical giant Sun Pharma's ransomware disrupted its internal operations and supply chain, causing **Rs. 30 crore** in losses. Hackers entered through a phishing email and encrypted internal servers. Companies should train employees to identify phishing attempts, install anti-ransomware software, and maintain offline data backups for rapid recovery. ## **19\\. BharatPe Hacked: August 2022** Phishing emails led to a breach of employees' inboxes, leaking internal documents and financial reports. The attackers used social engineering to mimic trusted contacts, tricking employees into sharing login credentials. While no customer data was stolen, the breach hurt investor confidence. Using email MFA, spam filters, and awareness campaigns can block future phishing attempts. ## **20\\. Cyberattack on AIIMS: December 2022** India's top hospital, AIIMS, suffered a ransomware attack that took **3 million** patient records. The servers remained slow for approximately two weeks, which caused major disruption. **Read Also: [The Rise of Agentic AI in Cyber Warfare: Implications for Global Security](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/the-rise-of-agentic-ai-in-cyber-warfare-implications-for-global-security)** ## **21\\. CloudSEK Data Breach: December 2022** In 2022, hackers stole internal data from the cybersecurity firm CloudSEK and exposed API keys on **GitHub.** The breach revealed how even security companies can be vulnerable. Never use credentials in code repositories, and rotate all access tokens regularly. ## **22\\. Swachhta Platform Hacked, September 2022** Hackers breached India's Swachh Bharat (Clean India) platform, a government site that collected public sanitation feedback and cleanliness reports. The attackers took advantage of outdated CMS plugins and weak credentials, allowing them to deface the homepage and delete parts of the citizen feedback database. ## **23\\. Zivame Data Breach, 2022** In 2022, Indian lingerie retailer Zivame experienced an excessive data breach exposing personal and transactional information of nearly **1.5 million** customers. The data included names, phone numbers, email addresses and partially masked payment records. Investigators traced the cause to an unsecured database server left open to the public without password protection. The leaked dataset appeared later on dark web forums for sale. ## **24\\. Air India / SITA Passenger Data Breach, 2021** Recently, in 2021, a global cyberattack on SITA, the IT provider for various airlines, exposed personal data of over **4.5 million** Air India passengers, which included passport details, ticket numbers, birth dates, and contact information. The breach was traced to unauthorised access in SITA's passenger service system, which connected multiple airlines worldwide, compromising long-term passenger privacy. That's why airlines and travel companies must vet all external vendors for compliance with strict cybersecurity standards, enforce encryption for shared databases and deploy continuous threat detection across connected systems. ## **25\\. Domino's India Customer Data Leak, 2021** Hackers exposed nearly **180 million** customer order details, including their names, phone numbers and even GPS coordinates. Attackers used an unsecured server within the company's order-tracking infrastructure, and later they published the full dataset on the dark web. The exposed location information was essentially alarming, as it could reveal customers' routines and residential details. Companies handling location-based services should encrypt all customer data, mask stored addresses and set strict retention periods for order records. **Read Also: [Zero Trust Security: The Future of Cyber Defense](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/zero-trust-security-the-future-of-cyber-defense)** ## **In the End** India's cybersecurity reflects both rapid progress and rising exposure. Attackers have now shifted to multi-stage ransomware, insider misuse, and AI-generated phishing. Organisations that invested early in zero-trust controls, employee awareness programmes, and regular threat monitoring have contained incidents faster and have limited damage. Every sector, private or public, must treat cybersecurity as an **operational priority** rather than a compliance task tied to reputation, customer trust, and business continuity. ## **Frequently Asked Questions** ### **Which sector faces the most cyber threats in India?** The financial, healthcare, telecom and e-commerce sectors top the list due to their high data value. Banking APIs, digital payment apps, and hospital systems are common ransomware and credential theft targets. ### **What are the main reasons behind the rise in cyberattacks in India?** The main reasons are rapid digitisation, weak password habits, over-reliance on cloud storage without proper encryption, and phishing campaigns using AI-written messages. ### **How can individuals protect themselves from data leaks in India?** Use unique passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, avoid public Wi-Fi for banking, and never click unknown links in SMS or WhatsApp messages.

From the wrath of [**cyclones**](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper1/cyclone-19) like **Odisha in 1999** to [**2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami**](https://www.drishtiias.com/printpdf/disaster-management-i#:~:text=The%20Indian%20Ocean%20Tsunami%20(2004,more%20than%202%20lakh%20people.) to the recent landslides triggered by [**Cyclone Remal**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-remal) in the Northeast, the country has witnessed the destructive force of nature. While the establishment of the [**National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-disaster-management-authority-1) marked a positive step. The very nature of disasters has undergone a drastic shift. [**Extreme weather events**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/himalayas-more-prone-to-extreme-weather-events), often intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent and severe. New threats like [**heat waves**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/heat-waves-and-heat-index#:~:text=Heat%20wave%20is%20considered%20if,C%20to%206.4%C2%B0C.) are emerging, and even more concerning is the rise of **multi-hazard disasters**, leading to cascading effects and far greater destruction. In this critical scenario, reactive measures are no longer enough. India needs a **proactive approach** that prioritizes disaster preparedness. ### What is the Framework Related to Disaster Management in India? - **Disaster Management Act of 2005:** The [**Disaster Management Act of 2005**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/disaster-management-act-2005-invoked) has provided the legal and institutional framework for disaster management in India at national, state and district levels. - While the **primary responsibility of disaster management rests with the States**, the Central Government supports the efforts of State Governments by providing logistical and financial support. - **Institutional Framework under Disaster Management Act of 2005** : - **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA):** Apex body headed by the **Prime Minister,** responsible for policy, plan, and guideline formulation for disaster management (DM). - NDMA addresses both **natural and man-made disasters** and coordinates enforcement and implementation. - **National Executive Committee (NEC):** Assists NDMA, chaired by the Union **Home Secretary,** comprising various secretaries and officials. - Prepares and monitors the National Plan for DM and coordinates responses to disaster situations. - **State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA):** Headed by the **Chief Minister,** responsible for state-level DM policies and plans, coordinating implementation, and integrating mitigation measures in state development plans. - **District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA):** Led by the **District Collector** with an elected representative as Co-Chairperson. - Prepares and implements district-level DM plans and ensures compliance with national and state policies. - **Local Authorities:** Includes **[Panchayati Raj Institutions](https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/panchayati-raj-institution-pri), [Municipalities](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/urban-local-government-in-india)**, **District and Cantonment Boards**, and Town Planning Authorities. Responsible for capacity building, relief, rehabilitation, and preparing DM plans. - **Key Institutions:** - **National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM)**: Focuses on capacity development, training, research, and documentation. - Functions under NDMA’s guidelines and aims to become a **‘Centre of Excellence’ in DM.** - **National Disaster Response Force (NDRF):** Specialized response force for natural and man-made disasters, including Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear emergencies. - Operates under NDMA's direction, with eight battalions positioned across different locations. - **Committees:** - **Cabinet Committee on Management of Natural Calamities (CCMNC):** Oversees management of natural calamities, suggests preventive measures, and promotes public awareness. - **International Commitments:** - [**Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR):**](https://www.drishtiias.com/summary-of-important-reports/sendai-framework-report) India is a signatory to the SFDRR which was adopted during the **Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction** in March 2015. - India is dedicated to achieving the seven goals set under the framework through systematic and sustainable efforts. - **Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA):** India is a signatory to the HFA, adopted globally to reduce disaster losses in lives and economic and environmental assets. - The HFA set three strategic goals and five priority action areas focused on integrating disaster risk reduction into **sustainable development policies,** capacity building, preparedness, and vulnerability reduction. ### What are the Current Major Disaster Threats that India Faces? - **Floods**: India experiences frequent [**floods**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/floods-havoc-in-india#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20cause%20of,dams%2C%20barrages%2C%20or%20siltation.), particularly during the monsoon season. Over **40 million hectares (12% of land)** are prone to floods and river erosion. It is getting exacerbated by [**Glacial Lake Outburst Floods.**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/glacial-lake-outburst-flood#:~:text=A%20glacial%20lake%20outburst%20flood,or%20the%20inflow%20of%20meltwater.) - **Examples:** Floods in **Bihar (2023), Assam** (2022) - **Cyclones and Storms**: India's coastline is susceptible to cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Of the **7,516 km long coastline**, approximately **5,700 km** is vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis. - **Examples: [Cyclone Biparjoy](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/india-s-cyclone-preparedness) (2023)** and **[Cyclone Fani](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-fani) (2019).** - **Earthquakes:** India is located in a seismically active region, with several fault lines running across the country. 58.6% of the landmass is prone to moderate to very high intensity earthquakes. - **Examples:** Earthquake in **Mizoram** (2022), Earthquake in **Sikkim** (2011) - **Droughts:** Prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall patterns can lead to severe [**droughts,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/drought-in-europe) affecting agriculture and water resources. **68%** of the cultivable area is susceptible to drought. - **Examples:** Drought in 66% of **Maharashtra** (2024). - **Landslides:** Hilly and mountainous regions in India are prone to [**landslides**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/landslide-atlas-of-india#:~:text=Landslides%20are%20natural%20disasters%20occurring,slope%20is%20termed%20a%20landslide.), especially during heavy rainfall or earthquakes. India is considered among the top five landslide-prone countries globally. - **Examples:** Landslides in **Himachal Pradesh (** 2023), Landslides in **Manipur** (2022). - **Heat Waves:** Rising temperatures and prolonged periods of high heat can lead to life-threatening heat waves. - **Examples:** Heat waves across India (2022, 2023, 2024). - The country reported **280 heat wave days** from 11th March- 18th May, 2022. - **Forest Fires:** Dry conditions and human activities can contribute to [**forest fires,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/forest-fires-9#:~:text=Also%20called%20bush%20or%20vegetation,e.g.%2C%20wind%2C%20topography).) causing environmental damage and air pollution. Based on the forest inventory records, **54.40% of forests in India** are exposed to occasional fires - **Examples:** Forest fires in **Himachal Pradesh (2024)** and Forest fires in **Goa** (2023). - **Industrial and Chemical Accidents:** India's growing industrial sector and improper handling of hazardous materials can lead to industrial and chemical accidents. - **Examples:** Chemical spill in **Surat** (2023), Industrial fire in **Mumbai** (2024). ### What Factors are Exacerbating India’s Disaster Risk? - **Urbanization and Unplanned Development:** Rapid urbanization and unplanned development in cities have increased the vulnerability to disasters like floods and earthquakes. - **Example:** The **2023 Chennai floods** were attributed to unchecked development and encroachment on water bodies and wetlands. - **Rising Climate Change Impact:** Climate change is amplifying the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, and droughts. - **Example**: The devastating [**Cyclone Amphan in 2020**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-amphan) was fueled by warmer ocean temperatures due to climate change. - **Aging Infrastructure and Lack of Maintenance:** India's aging infrastructure, such as **dams, bridges, and buildings, coupled** with inadequate maintenance, increases the risk of disasters. - The **Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water** in 2023 raised concerns over the safety of aging dams that are **more than 100 years old.** - **Environmental Degradation:** Activities like **deforestation, mining, and unsustainable land-use practices** have increased the risk of landslides and soil erosion. - **Example:** The [**2022 Joshimath land subsidence crisis**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/joshimath-land-subsidence) in Uttarakhand was attributed to unregulated construction and mining activities. - **Industrial and Technological Hazards:** India's growing industrialization and reliance on hazardous materials increase the risk of industrial accidents and chemical disasters. - **Example:** The gas leak at a chemical plant in **Visakhapatnam** (2020) exposed thousands to toxic fumes. ### What Measures Should India Adopt to Reduce Disaster Risk and Enhance Disaster Preparedness? - **Establish Dedicated Disaster Response Corridors:** Designate and develop dedicated disaster response corridors, including **road networks, rail links, and air routes,** to ensure uninterrupted access for emergency services and aid during disasters. - These corridors could be designed to be resilient to hazards and equipped with necessary infrastructure and resources for efficient disaster response. - **Promote Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure:** Mandate the adoption of disaster-resilient design and construction principles for all critical infrastructure projects, such as bridges, dams, power plants, and communication networks. - Implementing **stricter building codes** that mandate disaster-resistant construction using **earthquake-proof materials, fire-proof materials and wind-resistant designs**. - Additionally, offering tax breaks and financial assistance for retrofitting existing structures to improve their resilience. - **Develop Disaster-Resilient Agricultural Practices:** Promote the adoption of disaster-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crops, precision farming, and soil conservation techniques. - Learning from successful examples like **Burkina Faso's Zai pit farming technique,** which enhances soil moisture retention and crop yields during droughts. - **Promote Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR):** Integrate ecosystem-based approaches into disaster risk reduction strategies by conserving, restoring, and sustainably managing natural ecosystems like **forests, [wetlands](http://wetlands), and coastal habitats.** - These ecosystems can act as **natural barriers against hazards like floods, storms, and landslides,** while also providing co-benefits like carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. - **Strengthen Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems:** Develop robust, integrated early warning systems that can detect and provide timely alerts for multiple hazards, such as cyclones, floods, heatwaves, and landslides. - Leveraging advanced technologies like **[remote sensing](https://www.drishtiias.com/current-affairs-news-analysis-editorials/news-editorials/2023-05-12), AI, and [big data analytics](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper3/big-data-1)** to improve hazard monitoring, forecasting, and risk communication. - **Micronet Grids for Critical Infrastructure:** Establish localized, self-sufficient power grids powered by renewable sources like solar and micro-hydro for critical infrastructure like hospitals and communication systems. - This ensures continued functionality even during widespread power outages caused by disasters. - **Mental Health Response Teams:** Integrating mental health professionals into disaster response efforts to provide **psychological support** to survivors dealing with trauma, anxiety, and displacement. This can significantly improve long-term recovery outcomes. - **Enhanced Institutional Capacity:** The institutions must hire permanent workforce rather than contractual. - A permanent workforce allows for continuous **skill development, knowledge transfer, and institutional memory.** - This fosters a more capable disaster management system compared to relying on temporary staff who may lack experience. - Moreover, the Local bodies should be allocated a substantial **Disaster Readiness Reserve to complement disaster reactivity to proactive measures.** | | | --- | | **_Drishti Mains Question:_** Examine the factors contributing to India's increasing vulnerability to disasters.What measures should India adopt to enhance its disaster preparedness?? | ### UPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question (PYQ) ### _Mains:_ **Q.** Discuss the recent measures initiated in disaster management by the Government of India departing from the earlier reactive approach. **(2020)** **Q.** Vulnerability is an essential element for defining disaster impacts and its threat to people.

    "full_text": "[Defense & Security](https://southasianvoices.org/sav_channels/defense-security) # India-Pakistan Cyber Skirmishes and the Challenge of Attribution Written by [Kashoon Leeza](https://southasianvoices.org/author/kashoon) October 7, 202513 min read **Editor’s Note:** _This essay is part of a series entitled “ [Cybersecurity Threats, Law, and Norms: Priorities for South Asia](https://southasianvoices.org/collection-cyber-south-asia/),” a collaboration between the Stimson Center [Cyber](https://www.stimson.org/program/cyber/) and [South Asia](https://www.stimson.org/program/south-asia/) programs._ The recent India-Pakistan crisis in May illustrated how cyber and artificial intelligence are being integrated into military combat in the subcontinent, a significant development for South Asia’s fragile strategic stability. Along with an exchange of drone strikes, conventional missile firings, and aerial dogfights, the skirmish continued in the information domain, with Pakistani media reporting that the country’s military cyber wing [disrupted](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546050/security-sources-reveal-details-of-pakistans-massive-cyberattack-against-india) a communications network in India, predominantly affecting power distribution lines and government websites. Meanwhile, hackers sympathetic to the Indian government [leaked](https://x.com/cyberforcex) compromised data from Pakistan’s taxation authority and [targeted](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/how-pro-india-hackers-defended-country-during-cross-border-cyberattacks-amid-op-sindoor/articleshow/121385229.cms) other digital infrastructure. The active incorporation of cyber operations in this recent crisis, at least as acknowledged in public media reporting on both sides, is a departure from the past. It also raises serious concerns about the challenge of attribution on the subcontinent. Assigning responsibility for cyber operations comes with political, legal, and technical challenges. For one, in hostile India-Pakistan ties, there is limited space to entertain an ill-substantiated or inaccurate attribution as it risks escalation or creates domestic pressure for retaliation. Also, public attribution may be limited by the lack of well-established national frameworks for doing so. Neither India nor Pakistan currently have an official public attribution policy, making it difficult to assess their evidentiary standards and the validity of their threat intelligence. Limited official documents on procedures for incident response and forensic capacity suggest caution with regard to the credibility of public attribution. Thirdly, in cyber geopolitics, public attribution is a strategic choice determined by decisionmakers on a case-by-case basis. Cyber operations work best when clandestine and thus attribution is often intentionally restricted to avoid exposing technical capability. This is likely why Pakistan and India have generally approached official public attribution for cyber operations with caution in the past. The deployment of cyber-attacks complementary to kinetic operations along with unverifiable and potentially premature public attribution could set a dangerous precedent for a strategic environment as hostile and fragile as South Asia. Thus, in the absence of credible attribution tools and mechanisms, Islamabad and New Delhi would have to firmly resolve to adhere to responsible state behavior in cyberspace by doing the following: 1) establishing a cyber hotline to ensure communication channels are open, 2) supporting the applicability of international law to cyberspace, and 3) committing to non-proliferation of intrusive cyber technologies to non-state Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to conduct cyber operations on their behalf. [\\[1\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn1) More broadly for each, institutionalizing their attribution process would ensure transparency and reassurance. **India and Pakistan’s Cyber Doctrines** Even apart from its prominent role in the recent India-Pakistan crisis, cybersecurity has found a significant place in both countries’ national security postures in recent years. In 2019, then Indian Minister of State for Defence [confirmed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-setting-up-of-defence-cyber-agency/articleshow/72264836.cms) the development of a defense cyber agency to handle cyber threats in a military context as well as budgetary allocations for cyber operations. In 2021, India’s former National Security Advisor acknowledged New Delhi’s capability to conduct “ [cyber sabotage and cyber warfare _._](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/M.-K.-Narayanan-on-India-Pakistan-diplomacy-and-terrorism/article55940567.ece)” And in 2024, the Indian Ministry of Defence [announced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms) a joint doctrine for cyberspace operations, shifting away from the country’s previous policy of strategic ambiguity on the use of cyber in the warfare domain, and integrating both [defensive and offensive capabilities](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2153626). [\\[2\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn2) While Pakistan does not have a pronounced cyber doctrine, Islamabad’s national security posture reflects the necessity of integrating cyber capabilities with military operations. Inaugurating the Army’s Cyber Division in 2018, the then Chief of Army Staff articulated that “ [firepower and cyber have emerged as the mainstay of future war.”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369646/firepower-cyber-have-emerged-as-mainstay-of-future-war-coas) Pakistan has also invested in cyber capacity, as the [2021 National Cybersecurity Policy](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) reiterates, to protect national critical infrastructure as well as government information systems. These policy documents underline that India and Pakistan recognize the importance of investing in cyber capability to uphold their national interests. The next section explores how each state potentially uses these capabilities for strategic gain. **Cyber Capability and Operations** Countries are increasingly employing state capabilities to conduct cyber operations to achieve strategic objectives such as intelligence gathering; Pakistan and India are no different. Over the past few years, each state is alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage. This is done either through state capability or threat actors backed by the state. Publicly available information suggests that [APT 36](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-36)—also known as [Transparent Tribe](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector/) and [SideCopy](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/operation_c-major)—is a Pakistan-linked APT group, alleged to have conducted cyber [espionage](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) particularly in India and Afghanistan. Likewise, APT groups such as [Sidewinder](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/#%3A~%3Atext%3DSidewinder%20is%20a%20suspected%20Indian%2CChina%2C%20Nepal%2C%20and%20Afghanistan) and [Patchwork](https://medium.com/@Ab_Hussain/indian-apts-target-middle-east-1e4a11b3ce95) are thought to be Indian state-backed threat actors, conducting cyber operations in Pakistan and elsewhere. > “Over the past few years, \\[India and Pakistan are\\] alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage.” While there is limited information publicly available regarding the cyber operations conducted by each side, some sources do point to state acquiescence or support. A report by a Canadian firm [revealed](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/media/27613/ocr) that in 2021, the Indian government had allegedly conducted [cyber surveillance](https://www.dawn.com/news/1636767) on Pakistan’s [political leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/) using the Israeli [Pegasus software](https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-pegasus-spyware/). India-based hacking groups reportedly continued to [target](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) Pakistani government entities in the following years aiming to infiltrate systems and access computer controls. Similarly, media reports claimed that Pakistan-based hackers had [deployed](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) malware against Indian government and defense sectors, attempting to gain access to sensitive information. In 2019, the cyber-attack on India’s nuclear facility, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, was thought by some [analysts](https://www.orfonline.org/research/decoding-motives-behind-the-kudankulam-intrusion-58083) to have been perpetrated by Pakistan, though there was no public attribution. The technical attribution by cybersecurity firms [pointed](https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/cyber-attack-on-kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant.pdf) to a North Korean state-sponsored entity, the Lazarus Group. This complex picture of the potential use of proxies points to the challenge of attribution in an India-Pakistan context. **The Attribution Challenge** Attribution in cyberspace is the process of identifying and assigning responsibility to threat actors behind the cyber operation or malicious activity. However, attribution is rarely straightforward because, unlike physical crimes, cyber actors can hide behind the anonymity of the internet or impersonate other computers. Threat actors can also remain in the system undetected, silently stealing information through stolen passwords or impersonation. In terms of technical challenges, the sophistication of the operation depending on capability could also make it difficult to trace the crime back to an actor. For instance, during the India-Pakistan crisis in May, the Indian cyber agency, Maharashtra Cyber, reported a significant surge in cyber-attacks [originating](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace#:~:text=noted%20a%20surge%20in%20DDoS,in%20these%20cyberattacks%20as%20it) from Pakistan as well as countries like Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh. Threat actors using the location of a third country is often a deliberate and popular tactic to confuse the perpetrator’s identity and origin, as an IP address is usually the first source of identification. A popular global example is the 2018 [Olympic Destroyer cyberattack in South Korea](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/olympic-destroyer/21494/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the,uproar%20was%20no%20laughing%20matter.), when the [Russian threat actors](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/) used sophisticated tactics to conceal their identity, enabling the blame to be deflected to North Korea and China. Thus, even if one actor might visibly be responsible, there might be someone else behind the keyboard. Moreover, technical attribution requires advanced threat intelligence capability, without which attribution could be erroneous and enable “false flag” categorization. For example, recently, Russian state-linked cyber group Turla allegedly attempted to access data exfiltrated from Indian military networks. Threat intelligence by Microsoft and Lumen’s BlackLotus Labs indicate that Turla [compromised a network](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) of Pakistan-based group SideCopy to spy on the Indian network. This created a false impression, shifting the blame towards Pakistan. This reiterates that the use of sophisticated techniques in an operation and the lack of advanced capability for forensic analysis can potentially obscure a threat actor’s identity, making attribution a challenge. Even advanced nations struggle with having requisite forensic capacity, so relatively newer cyber entrants like India and Pakistan will have to invest more efforts in this space. The key legal challenge India and Pakistan face regarding attribution is the lack of a transparent, and credible attribution framework. Unlike some countries, India and Pakistan do not have a formal attribution policy, making it difficult for independent analysts to assess the validity of their institutional processes. In practice, the process involves a loose [network of agencies](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/mapping-indias-cybersecurity-administration-in-2025?lang=en) coordinating technical and intelligence findings, raising concerns about the lack of consistent and verifiable evidentiary standards. It was in highlighting some of these challenges that Pakistan’s 2023 [position](https://docs-library.unoda.org/Open-Ended_Working_Group_on_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_-_(2021)/UNODA.pdf) on applicability of international law in cyberspace emphasized cross-border coordination and cooperation globally to ensure substantiated attribution. A lack of consistent evidentiary standards complicates attribution and can leave such efforts open to criticism as being politically motivated, making it critical for India and Pakistan to address this lacuna. This leads to the political challenge of attribution. The United States and [Five Eyes](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/fv-cntry-mnstrl-en.aspx) allies often attribute cyber-attacks when they need to reinforce international pressure on political adversaries or justify policy shifts. New Delhi and Islamabad have approached attribution rather cautiously. Though there are multiple reasons for this, the obvious one is to avoid jumping the gun and pointing to an adversary, which may create a particularly dangerous scenario of escalation. **Redefining Crises and Stability in South Asia** Attribution uncertainty creates costs for stability in South Asia and risks escalation in a future India- Pakistan crisis. Both countries share a hostile past and a tense strategic environment, leaving limited space for misunderstanding and miscalculation. A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing, tarnishing trust on both sides and instilling doubt. Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression. Pakistan’s 2021 Cyber Security Policy explicitly mentions that a cyberattack on critical infrastructure would be regarded as an [act of aggression](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) and be met with an appropriate response. > “A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing \\[…\\] Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression.” Another predicament is the question of proportionate response to an offensive cyber intrusion conducted by a state or state-linked threat actors without clear attribution. This is a conundrum faced by states globally, not just India and Pakistan. Determining what is a proportionate response in cyberspace currently lies at the discretion of the state. Some countries have included the principle of proportionality in formal statements unpacking how they interpret international law as applying to their conduct in cyberspace. According to its 2023 statement, while Pakistan acknowledges proportionality as applying in the context of conflict and international humanitarian law, it does not otherwise present views on response. India has not yet published a national statement. Such norms and behavior are either unaddressed or awaiting legal applicability in international frameworks. For the complicated security environment of South Asia, integration of cyber capability without legal clarity is thus worrisome. In times of active conflict, cyber operations, including information and influence operations, can create a [fog of war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQvsb4ouuI0) for decisionmakers and undermine the process of crisis management. Persistent cyber intrusions could also further compromise trust and impact and possibly backtrack the confidence-building measures (CBMs) already in place between India and Pakistan. Given that nuclear CBMs between India and Pakistan are already tenuous, a potential cyber-attack or even a data breach could be misperceived as altering the balance of power. **Policy Recommendations** To ensure that cyber does not introduce yet another element of uncertainty and that the precarious balance of power is maintained on the subcontinent, policymakers in India and Pakistan should: **_Establish a cyber hotline:_** Cyber operations can perpetuate misperception and misunderstanding, especially with attribution challenges. Therefore, rapid communication during a cyber crisis is critical. Both countries could exchange doctrines, ensure technical cooperation, and maintain a directory in case of crisis. Cyber CBMs, including hotlines and dedicated focal points for exchange, can also potentially enhance a sense of predictability. **_Support the applicability of international law to cyberspace:_** While there is consensus across the board that international law applies to cyberspace, states are still discussing how core legal principles and existing commitments, such as the non-use of force, proportionality, sovereignty, and due diligence, apply to cyberspace. Islamabad and New Delhi are advised to actively adhere to international and bilateral negotiations, such as the UN’s recently launched Global Mechanism on ICTs, successor to the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. Pakistan published its national position paper in 2023 outlining the applicability of international law. India could follow suit, to maintain accountability and transparency. **_Commit to restraining proliferation of offensive intrusion capabilities:_** To dodge attribution and accountability, states often employ non-state APT groups to influence cyber operations. This results in proliferation of sophisticated intrusive cyber technologies and capabilities to non-state threat actors, not bound by rules and norms of state responsibility. Cyber operations through non-state APT actors help maintain plausible deniability. India and Pakistan should refrain from transferring capabilities to non-state APT groups to ensure responsible state behavior and maintain stability. **_Institutionalize attribution:_** To ensure responsible state behavior, both India and Pakistan should consider improving their attribution process. Institutionalizing the process and detailing their evidentiary standards to substantiate the findings will build confidence in their intelligence and threat assessments. Publishing a national attribution policy would explain the objectives behind disclosing a breach or attack, beyond merely aiming for political scoring. Further, both states could also benefit from investing in legal and technical capacity-building for attribution, including in collaboration with private entities and multilateral partnerships. As their decades-long hostilities spill over into cyberspace, there is likely a higher probability of cyber operations increasing in an India-Pakistan context. Realizing the serious implications of cyber threats to strategic stability, Pakistan and India are advised to seriously engage in the measures above that would reduce misperception, increase accountability and transparency, and indicate their commitments to the norms and practices of international law and responsible state behavior during conflict and peace time. _Views expressed are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the positions of South Asian Voices, the Stimson Center, or our supporters._ Also Read: [Cyber Quicksand?

Offensive capabilities are used to deny, disrupt, and degrade or destroy the adversary’s systems or networks for military or strategic purposes. However, the nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to neatly distinguish between offensive and defensive actions; some activities, like those carried out by security researchers for the purpose of testing for vulnerabilities, could be viewed as an offensive action. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Image 1: [blickpixel via Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/circuit-board-computer-chip-564814/) Image 2: [Great Norwegian Encyclopedia](https://snl.no/Kjernekraft_i_India) Posted in: [Crisis](https://southasianvoices.org/category/crisis/), [Cybersecurity](https://southasianvoices.org/category/cybersecurity/), [Escalation Control](https://southasianvoices.org/category/escalation-control/), [India](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india/), [India-Pakistan Relations](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india-pakistan-relations/), [Pakistan](https://southasianvoices.org/category/pakistan/), [Technology](https://southasianvoices.org/category/technology/) Share this: ## Subscribe to our newsletter Stay informed about the subcontinent.

This marks a significant departure from the group’s usual playbook, which has been centred on Windows-centric malware and spear-phishing lures. By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. APT36’s targeting of BOSS Linux indicates a calculated attempt to undermine confidence in this indigenous platform. A successful breach not only grants access to sensitive communications and classified data but also erodes institutional faith in self-reliant technological ecosystems. This outcome serves Pakistan’s interests on multiple levels: tactically, by harvesting intelligence; and strategically, by discrediting India’s efforts at digital autonomy. > By expanding its reach to compromise BOSS Linux, a system widely adopted by Indian government entities, APT36 is signalling not merely a technical upgrade but a deliberate escalation on the cyber-espionage front in the India-Pakistan rivalry. The discovery of this campaign underscores an uncomfortable reality: Pakistan-based cyber actors, often operating under the aegis of state agencies or enjoying tacit state protection, are evolving their capabilities beyond low-level phishing attacks into strategically targeted, cross-platform espionage operations. This trend holds profound implications for India’s national security, not least because it compromises trust in indigenous technologies developed as alternatives to foreign software ecosystems. ## Anatomy of the New Campaign The latest intrusion by APT36 begins with a familiar vector, spear-phishing emails. Camouflaged as official government correspondence, these emails deliver compressed archives containing malicious desktop files. Unlike traditional Windows executables, these shortcuts are designed explicitly for Linux environments and crafted to resemble innocuous PDF files. When executed, the desktop file triggers a [series of covert commands](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) embedded in its Exec field. Utilities such as ‘curl’ and ‘xxd’ are then employed to fetch a hex-encoded payload from [attacker-controlled infrastructure](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments), decode it, and silently deploy it under the temporary directory. With execution rights granted, [the payload operates silently](https://www.scworld.com/brief/google-flags-malicious-use-of-linux-desktop-files#:~:text=Google%20flags%20malicious%20use%20of,across%20various%20Linux%20desktop%20environments) in the background, all while the user is distracted by a decoy PDF opened in parallel. > Forensic evidence suggests a Pakistan state-backed effort, given the substantial resources expended on developing BOSS Linux-specific attack chains and maintaining redundant infrastructure. The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. Persistence is achieved by ensuring that the [malware relaunches upon every login.](https://cloudsek.com/blog/investigation-report-apt36-malware-campaign-using-desktop-entry-files-and-google-drive-payload-delivery) Its communications are funnelled to command-and-control (C2) nodes and the newly registered domain, both of which reflect a carefully coordinated campaign.

The campaign is more than an opportunistic strike; it is an assault on India’s technological sovereignty. ## Pakistan’s Cyber-Espionage Landscape [Pakistan-supported hacking groups](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/) collectively serve Islamabad’s strategic agenda. [APT 36, also known as Transparent Tribe](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt-profile-transparent-tribe-aka-apt36/), is primarily focused on cyber espionage against the Indian government, targeting Indian defence personnel, diplomatic missions, and critical infrastructure. Its preferred tactics have included malware-laden documents, watering-hole attacks, and social engineering through fake recruitment portals. There have been reports of a [link between other APT-based groups](https://cybersrcc.com/2025/05/02/pakistan-linked-sidecopy-hackers-escalate-indian-cyberattacks-with-curlback-rat-and-spark-rat/#:~:text=SideCopy%20is%20a%20Pakistan%2Dlinked,and%20now%2C%20critical%20infrastructure%20sectors.), such as [SideCopy, SideWinder](https://cyble.com/threat-actor-profiles/transparenttribe/), and [TransparentTribe](https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-apt36/). These groups often share infrastructure, malware families, or operational overlaps, suggesting either coordination or common direction by Pakistan’s intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). ## A Global Nexus: Pakistan Supporting Hackers Beyond Borders While India remains the principal target, Pakistan-based hackers have extended their reach internationally, either independently or in collaboration with other state-linked actors. Several examples illustrate this global dimension. For instance, in 2021, soon after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan-linked hackers engaged in a campaign [against Afghan government](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-says-hackers-from-pakistan-targeted-people-in-the-previous-afghan-government/article37537222.ece) and civil society networks, consolidating Islamabad’s influence and monitoring rival factions. Similarly, there have been reported overlaps between Pakistani hacker groups and [campaigns affecting Gulf states](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/saudi-arabia-uae-face-brunt-apt-cyber-attacks-middle-east-threatcop-gwecc/), particularly those hosting large Indian diasporas. Espionage here has dual value: monitoring Indian activities abroad and gaining leverage with Gulf governments. Security firms have observed occasional alignment between Pakistani actors and broader anti-Western cyber campaigns, some with tacit [Chinese or Iranian involvement](https://www.indiandefensenews.in/2025/06/chinas-support-for-pakistan-and-iran.html#:~:text=Tuesday%2C%20June%2017%2C%202025%20by,desire%20to%20counterbalance%20Western%20influence.). These collaborations may be opportunistic rather than formal. Still, they indicate a willingness on the part of Pakistani hackers to position themselves as part of the global anti-Western cyber-espionage ecosystem. > As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). In essence, Pakistan has fostered an environment where state priorities, cybercrime networks, and ideological motivations blur into a hybrid threat matrix. The state benefits from plausible deniability while reaping the intelligence dividends of global cyber operations. ## **Evolution of Capabilities** Over the past decade, Pakistan-based hackers have evolved from low-level disruptors into sophisticated cyber-espionage actors. Between 2010 and 2014, their operations primarily involved [website defacements](https://www.idsa.in/publisher/issuebrief/digital-war-pakistans-cyber-activity-against-india), online propaganda, and basic [phishing attacks](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt36-a-phishing-campaign-targeting-indian-government-entities/#:~:text=An%20investigation%20into%20the%20domain%20revealed%20a%20notable%20connection%20to,targeting%20of%20Indian%20government%20entities.) aimed at embarrassing Indian institutions. From 2015 to 2019, groups like [APT36 matured technically](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/apt36-refines-tools-attacks-indian-targets#:~:text=APT36%20Refines%20Tools%20in%20Attacks%20on%20Indian%20Targets%20APT36%20Refines,Step%2Dby%2DStep%20Cyberattack%20Capability), shifting toward credential theft, malware infiltration, and sustained surveillance of India’s defence and diplomatic networks. The period 2020 to 2024 marked a cross-platform expansion, with Pakistan-linked actors [developing Android malware](https://therecord.media/android-malware-alleged-pakistan-espionage-campaign-india#:~:text=Android%20malware%20used%20in%20six,logs%20and%20delete%20all%20contacts.) targeting Indian military personnel through fake applications and deploying advanced Windows-based trojans with layered obfuscation. By 2025, the focus had moved to Linux-specific targeting, particularly against India’s indigenous BOSS Linux system. This development signals dedicated research capacity and a state-backed commitment to penetrating critical digital infrastructure. Such a trajectory reflects Pakistan’s transition from a nuisance-level cyber actor to a structured, strategic, and offensive one that directly threatens India’s technological and national security landscape. ## Strategic Implications for India The attack on India’s BOSS Linux should not be viewed as an isolated cyber incident but as part of a broader transnational security challenge unfolding in the grey zone of hybrid warfare. Pakistan’s strategy has long employed a blend of conventional, sub-conventional, and informational tools to weaken India’s security architecture, and cyber operations now represent its newest frontier. > Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. By targeting BOSS Linux, an indigenous operating system central to India’s drive for technological self-reliance, Pakistan-linked actors are staging an attack on India’s digital sovereignty. Beyond espionage, such operations enable adversaries to penetrate government systems on a large scale, intercepting sensitive policy, defence, and diplomatic communications that could influence decision-making during crises. In times of tension or limited conflict, pre-positioned malware could be activated to paralyse communication channels, interfere with logistics, or disrupt essential services, achieving strategic disruption without crossing the threshold of open war. In this sense, the targeting of BOSS Linux is symbolic of how the digital domain has become an extension of the battlefield, where state and proxy actors engage India in an unceasing contest for advantage in the grey zone. ## Defensive Priorities for India India must adopt a multi-layered, adaptive defence posture to counter the evolving threat landscape. 1. **_Mandate Indigenous Security Certification for Government Software_** **_:_** As India promotes platforms like BOSS Linux, there should be a mandatory and more rigorous security certification framework led by CERT-In, DRDO, and the National Informatics Centre (NIC). All open-source or indigenous software adopted by the government must undergo regular red-teaming, vulnerability audits, and penetration testing, with the results feeding into an early-warning repository. 2. **_Promote Public–Private Collaboration for Threat Intelligence Sharing_** **_:_** Given that India has one of the most advanced IT ecosystems and that private Indian cybersecurity companies have been able to track cyberattacks — particularly those targeting defence technology, finance, and telecommunications — more swiftly, there is a need for greater synergy between private and government agencies. Creating a secure national platform for the real-time exchange of threat data between government and industry would enhance situational awareness and facilitate early mitigation. 3. **_Create a ‘Trusted Digital Ecosystem’ Policy_** **_:_** Taking forward the country’s ‘Make in India’ mission, agencies overseeing the cybersecurity industry should promote a secure supply chain for hardware and software used in critical infrastructure. This includes regulating the import of networking equipment, mandating transparency in source code for government procurement, incentivising local cybersecurity start-ups, overcoming obstacles like No Cost, No Commitment (NCNC), and ensuring the start-ups do not migrate to Western countries. 4. **_Institutionalise Continuous Training and Capacity Building_** **_:_** A national programme for “Cybersecurity Literacy and Leadership” should be created for civil servants, military officers, and policymakers. 5. **_Develop a Strategic Cyber Deterrence Doctrine_** **_:_** India should articulate a formal doctrine defining how cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, government systems, or defence networks would be interpreted under national security law. Establishing clear thresholds for proportional responses — whether diplomatic, economic, or cyber-retaliatory — can serve as a deterrent to persistent actors like APT36. 6. **_Establish a National Cyber Command_** **_:_** Cyber threats should be treated not merely as technical incidents but as instruments of hybrid warfare. Therefore, the government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. ## Conclusion The exploitation of BOSS Linux by APT36 is not merely a technical episode, but a strategic signal: Pakistan’s cyber-espionage machinery is adapting to India’s countermeasures and targeting indigenous solutions once thought secure. Transparent Tribe’s evolution from Windows payloads to Linux-specific malware reveals an expanding toolkit designed to penetrate India’s technological backbone. > The government and military must upgrade the Defence Cyber Agency to a Command-level body and formulate a holistic mechanism for securing national cyberspace. Pakistan’s broader cyber ecosystem, supported by state patronage and interwoven with global hacker networks, poses a persistent threat to India’s national security. For New Delhi, the challenge is not only to neutralise these campaigns but also to reinforce trust in indigenous systems and project resilience. Cyber warfare, unlike conventional conflict, unfolds silently yet relentlessly. In this theatre, the battle is as much about perceptions of security as it is about technical breaches. India’s defensive strategy must therefore be holistic, encompassing technological, institutional, and diplomatic aspects, to ensure that its sovereignty in cyberspace remains uncompromised. **_Soumya Awasthi_** _is a Fellow with the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation._ [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/www.orfonline.org#_ftnref1) BOSS Linux is a free, Indian operating system based on Linux, created by the government to promote open-source software and offer a secure system tailored for India's needs.

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

    "full_text": "💥UPSC 2026, 2027 UAP Mentorship Aug Batch [Talk to Mentor](https://t.ly/CDwebtopbar) [Skip to content](https://www.civilsdaily.com/www.civilsdaily.com#content) Note4Students From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : **Mains level:** Internet Shutdown; Impact on Fundamental Rights; ## **Why in the News?** According to the report, there were 296 Internet shutdowns worldwide in 2024, and India accounted for 84 of them, making up 28% of the total. ## **What percentage of global Internet shutdowns due to communal violence occurred in India?** - **High Proportion of Global Communal Violence Shutdowns: 56% of global Internet shutdowns due to communal violence occurred in India** in 2024. **Example:** Out of 41 communal violence-related shutdowns worldwide, **23 were imposed in India**, highlighting the frequent use of Internet curbs to control communal tensions. - **Regional Concentration of Shutdowns:** Most shutdowns occurred in conflict-prone regions like **Manipur (21 shutdowns)**, **Haryana (12 shutdowns)**, and **Jammu & Kashmir (12 shutdowns)**. **Example:** During **ethnic clashes in Manipur**, authorities repeatedly shut down the Internet to curb the spread of misinformation and unrest. - **Pattern of State-led Shutdowns:** State governments are the primary enforcers of communal violence-related shutdowns. **Example:** **Haryana** imposed shutdowns following communal violence in **Nuh district** to prevent further escalation and maintain public order. ## **How have the primary reasons for Internet shutdowns in India evolved between 2016 and 2024?** - **From National Security to Protest Control (2016–2024):** Initially, Internet shutdowns were mainly enforced for **national security** and **counter-terrorism**, particularly in sensitive areas like **Jammu & Kashmir**. **Example:** A **213-day shutdown** was imposed in **2019** after the abrogation of **Article 370** to curb potential unrest. - **Increase in Shutdowns During Protests (2020–2024):** Shutdowns have become a frequent measure to **suppress protests** and **prevent misinformation** from spreading. **Example:** Internet services were suspended at **Delhi’s borders** during the **2020–2021 Farmers’ Protests** to limit protest coordination. - **Growing Use of Shutdowns for Communal Violence (2022–2024):** There has been a rising trend of using shutdowns to **contain communal violence** and **prevent further escalation**. **Example:** In **2023**, **Haryana’s Nuh district** faced an Internet shutdown following **communal riots** to restore public order. - **Emergence of Exam-Related Shutdowns (2022–2024):** Internet shutdowns are increasingly being used to **prevent cheating** during **competitive examinations**, raising concerns over their necessity. **Example:** **Jharkhand** imposed a shutdown during the **2024 General Graduate Level Combined Competitive Examination** to prevent malpractices. - **Targeted Shutdowns in Conflict Zones (Ongoing):** Shutdowns continue to be heavily concentrated in **conflict-prone regions** like **Jammu & Kashmir**, **Manipur**, and parts of the **Northeast** due to ethnic and insurgency-related violence. **Example:** In **2024**, **21 shutdowns** were enforced in **Manipur** during episodes of ethnic violence to curb the spread of inflammatory content. ## **What are the different types of Internet shutdowns imposed by authorities?** - **Complete Internet Blackout:** Total suspension of all Internet services, including mobile data, broadband, and Wi-Fi. Example: The **213-day shutdown** in **Jammu & Kashmir (2019)** after the abrogation of **Article 370**. - **Mobile Internet Shutdown:** Suspension of mobile data services while keeping broadband and Wi-Fi operational. Example: **Manipur** experienced **21 mobile Internet shutdowns** in **2024** due to **ethnic violence**. - **Targeted or Localized Shutdown:** Internet suspension in specific geographic areas or for specific services like social media. Example: **Haryana’s Nuh district** faced a **localized shutdown** in **2023** following **communal riots**. ## **How do Internet shutdowns impact fundamental rights in India?** - **Violation of Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19(1)(a)):** Internet shutdowns restrict individuals from expressing opinions, accessing information, and engaging in public discussions. **Example:** During the **2020–21 Farmers’ Protests**, Internet services were suspended in **Delhi’s border areas**, limiting protestors’ ability to communicate and share updates. - **Obstruction of the Right to Practice Any Profession or Business (Article 19(1)(g)):** Internet disruptions adversely affect businesses, digital transactions, and online services, hindering the right to earn a livelihood. **Example:** The **213-day Internet shutdown in Jammu & Kashmir (2019)** caused significant economic losses, especially in the **tourism and e-commerce** sectors. - **Disruption of the Right to Education (Article 21A):** Shutdowns impede access to online education, causing academic disruptions and limiting students’ learning opportunities. **Example:** In **Manipur (2023)**, prolonged Internet suspensions during **ethnic violence** interrupted **online classes** and **examinations**. - **Denial of the Right to Access Information (Implicit under Article 19(1)(a)):** Internet curbs block access to crucial information, particularly during emergencies, affecting public safety and awareness. **Example:** In **Haryana (2023)**, Internet services were suspended during **communal riots**, preventing access to **emergency services** and **safety information**. - **Violation of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21):** Shutdowns disrupt essential services like healthcare and emergency communication, posing a threat to life and personal liberty. **Example:** During the **COVID-19 pandemic**, Internet restrictions in **Jammu & Kashmir** limited access to **telemedicine** and **critical health updates**. | | | --- | | ## **What is the judiciary’s stance on Internet shutdowns in India?** - **Recognition of Internet Access as a Fundamental Right:** The Supreme Court of India, in the **Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India (2020)** case, ruled that **access to the Internet** is protected under **Article 19(1)(a)** (freedom of speech and expression) and **Article 19(1)(g)** (freedom to practice any profession or trade). - The Court held that **indefinite Internet shutdowns are unconstitutional** and must be **proportionate and temporary**. - **Mandate for Procedural Safeguards and Review:** The Court emphasized that any Internet suspension under **Section 144 of the CrPC** or the **Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017** must follow **due process**. - The **mandate for procedural safeguards and review** was established in the **Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India (2020)** judgment. - **Balancing Security and Fundamental Rights:** While recognizing the **state’s power** to impose Internet shutdowns for public safety and national security, the judiciary has stressed that such measures must balance **individual freedoms** with **legitimate state interests**. - In **Faheema Shirin v. State of Kerala (2019)**, the Kerala High Court affirmed **access to the Internet as part of the right to education** under **Article 21A**. | ## **Way forward:** - **Strengthen Legal Oversight and Transparency:** Implement clear guidelines for Internet shutdowns with **mandatory judicial review** and **public disclosure** of orders to prevent arbitrary restrictions and uphold **fundamental rights**. - **Promote Proportional and Targeted Measures:** Encourage the use of **less restrictive alternatives**, such as **content moderation** or **geofencing**, to address public safety concerns while **minimizing disruption** to essential services and civil liberties. ## **Mains PYQ:** **Q**‘Communalism arises either due to power struggle or relative deprivation.’ Argue by giving suitable illustrations. **(UPSC IAS/2018)** **[Get an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/)** [Attend Now](https://www.civilsdaily.com/enrollment-open-july-batch-uap-upsc-2026-2/) Subscribe Notify of new follow-up commentsnew replies to my comments Please login to comment 0 Comments Oldest NewestMost Voted Inline Feedbacks View all comments # JOIN THE COMMUNITY ### Join us across Social Media platforms. × wpDiscuz Insert",

These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. * * * ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India \\[CPI\\]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external security partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of domestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an Indian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime security activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington.

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

    "full_text": "# CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report: A New Era of Threats Emerges ## CrowdStrike Intelligence observes a thriving Chinese-language underground ecosystem and the rise of AI-developed ransomware operations. October 20, 2025 \\| [Counter Adversary Operations](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/author.counter-adversary-operations/) \\| [Threat Hunting & Intel](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/category.counter-adversary-operations/) The eCrime threat landscape in the Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region is quickly evolving, driven by a mix of regional and global adversaries. From Chinese-language underground marketplaces facilitating the sale of stolen data and illicit services, to a rise in AI-developed ransomware campaigns, threat actors across the region are seeking new ways to scale and accelerate their operations. The CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report provides a definitive view of these threats, based on frontline intelligence from CrowdStrike’s elite threat hunters and intelligence analysts. The report combines analysis of adversary tradecraft, underground economies, and monetization trends with observations from CrowdStrike analysts who track malicious activity. In a rapidly changing threat landscape, the CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report provides the clarity and context organizations need to anticipate attacks, strengthen their defenses, and outpace the eCrime adversaries targeting their operations. **Learn more:** Download the [CrowdStrike 2025 APJ eCrime Landscape Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/2025-apj-ecrime-landscape-report/) ## Tools and Techniques Fueling eCrime Operations Highly active Chinese-language underground marketplaces are core to eCrime operations across the APJ region, despite the Chinese government’s internet restrictions and eCrime crackdown. This ecosystem provides Chinese-speaking threat actors — many of whom have prioritized operational security in light of government control — with an anonymous place to buy and sell stolen data, phishing kits, malware, and money laundering services. The most prominent Chinese-language marketplaces, which include Chang’an, FreeCity, and Huione Guarantee, enable cybercriminals to operate anonymously through clearnet, darknet, and Telegram channels. Huione Guarantee, which built a reputation for transparency and trustworthiness among eCrime actors, facilitated an estimated $27 billion USD in transactions over its lifespan. eCrime adversaries operated with a strong focus on high-value targets. India, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore were the most affected countries; manufacturing, technology, industrials and engineering, financial services, and professional services were the most affected sectors. Between January 2024 and April 2025, 763 APJ-based victims were named on ransomware and data theft and extortion dedicated leak sites (DLSs). CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the rise of AI-developed ransomware across the region. _KillSec_ and _FunkLocker_, both ransomware-as-a-service providers, named a disproportionate number of APJ-based victims on their DLSs, comprising 35% and 32% of their total victims, respectively. Of these victims, most were based in India (21% for _FunkLocker_; 33% for _KillSec_). eCrime service providers support APJ activity by supplying the tools, infrastructure, and support cybercriminals need to scale phishing, malware distribution, and monetization operations. The report examines CDNCLOUD (bulletproof hosting), Graves International SMS (global SMS spam service), and _Magical Cat_ (phishing-as-a-service). In terms of tools used, CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified likely Chinese-speaking eCrime actors using remote access tools (RATs) to target Chinese and Japanese speakers. _ChangemeRAT_, _ElseRAT_, and _WhiteFoxRAT_ were among the tools deployed through SEO poisoning, malvertising, and phishing attacks disguised as purchase orders. ## Meet the SPIDERs Operating in APJ CrowdStrike tracks several eCrime adversaries targeting the region and four active eCrime adversaries based in the region, all tracked under the SPIDER moniker. These include: - **CHARIOT SPIDER**: Vietnam-based adversary that has compromised Microsoft IIS and Adobe ColdFusion web servers - **RADIANT SPIDER**: Chinese adversary that uses formjacking to harvest payment card data - **SINFUL SPIDER**: Chinese adversary that uses password spraying and vulnerability exploitation in internet-facing applications - **SOLAR SPIDER**: Targets banking and foreign exchanges using finance-themed phishing Apart from SOLAR SPIDER, these adversaries are primarily opportunistic and have not been observed concertedly targeting the region. While CrowdStrike Intelligence has not seen APJ eCrime actors explicitly prohibit regional targeting, Chinese-speaking marketplaces’ rules and emphasis on anonymity indicate they hope to avoid law enforcement attention. Organizations in the region should prioritize defending against these adversaries by focusing on their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), while strengthening identity protections, securing cloud and SaaS environments, and preparing for ransomware and social engineering threats.

Currently, around 50 GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded across India due to transmission bottlenecks, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. India needs a comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap that incorporates cluster-level demand forecasting to anticipate emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs. Given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, India must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. Over the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy (RE), ranking third behind China and the US in installations and power generation. More than 71% of India's total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately [247 gigawatt (GW),](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/) comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India's power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, [around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/indias-stranded-renewable-projects-double-to-over-50-gw-industry-documents-show/articleshow/123042172.cms?from=mdr), resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad [reaffirmed](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/cea-revises-transmission-plans-every-six-months-for-600-gw-renewables-integration/124114939) the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. **Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system** Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan's great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan's 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The [Rajasthan government’s proposal](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/government-to-establish-2k-mwh-battery-storage-plant-for-solar-power/124316705?utm_source=top_news&utm_medium=sectionListing) this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour(MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. **The need for a strategic roadmap** A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

USAID @ The Asia Foundation LS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Improving Lives, Expanding Opportunities INDIA-U.S. TRIANGULAR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 01 The Asia Foundation, 2022, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey - Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. The Asia Foundation: New Delhi Disclaimer This report is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the ‘India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) at The Asia Foundation. The opinions expressed here are solely of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government and The Asia Foundation. 02 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Foreword India and the U.S. share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. India’s long\u0002standing engagement in the region makes it a strong development partner and leader. The Asia Foundation through its India- U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a program funded by USAID, is working toward realizing this vision and strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s development cooperation footprint in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The program builds on the U.S. government’s commitment to strengthen triangular partnership programs with India in the Indo-Pacific region and is informed by the U.S. government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and its Pacific Islands Strategy. TriDeP seeks to support the Government of India’s development assistance in the Indo\u0002Pacific region by identifying countries keen to expand their development partnership with India in sectors defined by their country needs, and by supporting programming based on such identification. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Smart Agriculture and Renewable Energy are sectors where India demonstrates policy leadership and technical skills, and thus can provide sustainable solutions. This report presents a diagnostic study that maps India’s capabilities in disaster management, as well as identifying opportunities for India and the developing countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South Asia to partner for promising solutions. Over the years, India’s disaster management approach has evolved rapidly to respond to the slew of challenges posed by a range of disasters. India’s diverse geo-climatic conditions make it vulnerable to multiple natural and human\u0002caused disasters, thus prompting the country to develop tailored policies and frameworks for coordinated multi-stakeholder disaster-risk reduction efforts. TriDeP seeks to leverage India’s know-how in disaster management, by sharing technical expertise and knowledge and supporting local adaptation, to improve resilience and preparedness against disasters in the Indo\u0002Pacific region. TriDeP aims to do this in close collaboration with a range of stakeholders, including governments, communities, and the private sector, through cost-effective and context-specific solutions. This diagnostic identifies India’s expertise in establishing well-defined institutional systems; legislative, policy and planning frameworks; robust search and rescue capabilities; improved early warning systems; technological advancements for disaster risk management; improved emergency communication; expanded disaster resource and knowledge networks; emergency operations centers; enhanced response capabilities and systems; and post-disaster mental health management. The study also identifies opportunities for India-U.S. triangular cooperation across several countries in the Indo-Pacific region. While the diagnostic study was underway, the Covid-19 virus struck with severity unimagined in a century and has brought to the fore the disastrous dimensions of pandemics, including psychological and physical health challenges that require concerted medical responses to India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 03 address them. Several participants in a virtual meeting of experts from the Indo-Pacific region to discuss the study expressed interest in the knowledge and expertise of India in psychosocial care and telemedicine health services, both important focus areas that help to address pandemic-related health issues.

Sen Pilgrims being rescued from Badrinath after the 2021 Uttarakhand flood. 10 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey I ndia, due to its unique geo-climatic conditions, is vulnerable to multiple natural and human-caused disasters, such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, hailstorms, cold waves, heat waves, glacier lake outburst floods, wildfires, oil spills, and other major pollution events. The country’s journey toward holistic and modern disaster risk reduction (DRR) practices began more than 20 years ago, when several natural disasters resulted in thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses. These disasters spurred India toward a more comprehensive DRR approach, eventually leading the country to tremendous disaster management progress: Subsequent disasters have resulted in minimized deaths and losses because of India’s effective DRR efforts. Over the course of the past two decades, India’s disaster management approach evolved from a reactive, search-and-rescue, and relief-centered approach primarily centered on flood and drought to a proactive, holistic approach that includes prevention, mitigation, preparedness, capacity building, risk reduction, technological investment and advancements, community involvement, and risk resilience for a far wider range of hazards. Holistic disaster management requires mainstreaming DRR into policies, institutions, infrastructure, and logistics in order to develop tools for effective and efficient action. India developed DRR policies for multiple stakeholders by integrating inputs from domain experts and all levels of governments and communities; it also increased response effectiveness through international coalitions, and coordinated risk reduction capabilities at the national and local levels. India’s holistic DRR efforts involve robust legal frameworks; effective policy design and development; domestic policy and institutional coherence; a focus on capacity building, expert input, and knowledge sharing; well-oiled administrative mechanisms; an ability to prevent or mitigate disasters before they occur, as well as effective and inclusive rescue and recovery operations. India’s disaster management learning curve owes a great deal to how India adapted crucial disaster management elements from other countries to India’s own context. Now, other countries have the opportunity to emulate India’s DRR journey in order to accelerate their own efforts, thereby saving thousands of lives and millions in economic losses. India has multiple bilateral and multilateral DRR relationships with other countries, such as the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, the European Commission, and United Nations agencies. Given this international cooperation framework already in place and India’s extensive DRR capabilities, it would be hugely beneficial for India to branch out to additional triangular cooperation (TrC) initiatives, especially partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which already has a strong DRR backbone with India. These TrC initiatives would be led by India as the primary source of expertise and technical assistance and could also benefit from the involvement of several United States agencies and private-sector or nongovernmental organizations. India’s South-South development cooperation model would thus be considerably enhanced, with the triangulation of efforts between India and the United States increasing India’s development assistance footprint in the developing countries of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. This report begins with an explanation of India’s 20-year journey from search and rescue\u0002related crisis management to prevention, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 11 mitigation, and preparedness, setting the groundwork for how India’s experiences can be adapted to other countries’ own disaster management contexts. The second chapter details the interplay between India’s DRR strategy, legislation, policy interventions, disaster management administration and institutions, and its perspectives on gender equity and social inclusion in DRR efforts. Chapter three breaks down how India can share its knowledge and DRR capabilities through the country’s multiple DRR technologies and capacity-building institutions, including centers of excellence for training in general disaster management and early warning systems; specialized institutions for search and rescue and disaster assessment, mitigation, and planning; private- and nongovernmental organization\u0002run training institutes; Incident Command System adaptations; risk communication and language adaptations; and equipment stocks and suppliers. The fourth chapter outlines the DRR status of three Indo-Pacific sub-regions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indo-Pacific Islands, and briefly discusses the potential DRR needs of ideal TrC partners. Chapter five concludes with a discussion about the viability of TrC initiatives, and makes recommendations for suitable TrC activities in 10 Indo-Pacific countries. About the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) India, The Asia Foundation is implementing the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a three-year program in support of the United States’ and India’s mutual aims in the Indo\u0002Pacific Region. In a ground-breaking initiative to catalyze North-South-South triangular cooperation (TrC) throughout an entire region – the Indo-Pacific – rather than with a single country, the TriDeP program will facilitate partnerships between India, the United States, and several South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Indo-Pacific Island countries.1 The TriDeP program has identified three priority areas where India can share its proven expertise: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate-smart agriculture, and renewable energy. The TriDeP program team selected DRR for its inaugural research initiative to explore how and where India’s demonstrated DRR policy leadership, practical experience, and sustainable results can be shared with countries in the region. After assessing India’s DRR capacities and capabilities and matching them to the needs and capabilities of potential Indo-Pacific partner countries, the TriDeP program will develop demand-driven, context-specific TrC projects that combine Indian experience and Photographer: Saikiran Kesari Stranded citizens making their way through the flooded streets of Mumbai, India during the 2020 Mumbai floods. 12 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey expertise with Indian and American technical assistance, drawing on India’s centers of excellence, training institutions, relevant private sector entities, and nongovernmental and civil society organizations. Research Objectives The TriDeP program team undertook action research on India’s DRR institutions and capabilities in order to understand the Indian\u0002Indo-Pacific DRR landscape, identify DRR needs in potential beneficiary countries, highlight areas of India’s DRR expertise that could be shared, suggest priority partners and projects for initial TrC implementations, and determine suitable activities to support project design and implementation. Research Methodology The action research for this report took place from January through June 2021. The research process began with a thorough review of the literature followed by nine telephone and seven in-person interviews with 16 Indian government representatives, technical specialists, and practitioners experienced in DRR and disaster management in order to gain a preliminary overview of India’s current capabilities – what we will call the “supply-side” of DRR (see Annexure 1 for participant list). The study also involved extensive desk research to gather background information about India’s supply-side capabilities. The supply-side research also involved convening a group of 17 experts from India, including independent DRR experts, leaders of DRR civil society organizations (CSOs) working in India, and current and retired government functionaries who lead or have led India’s disaster responses. These experts were joined by six supporting Photographer: Dr. Ashok K A Doppler Radar meteorological geodesic dome atop a hillock at Vishakhapatnam, India. India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 13 staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 2 for participant list). The supply-side research was complemented by what we will call “demand-side” desk research about Indo-Pacific countries’ geographies and their disaster exposures, histories, institutional and technical capabilities, current disaster\u0002aid partnerships, and relevant socioeconomic profiles. The desk research was enhanced through discussions with a group of 39 experts in the fields of DRR and climate change impacts; these experts represented countries, states, or organizations from Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Germany, India, Nepal, United Kingdom, United Nations, United States, and international nongovernmental and civil society organizations. These experts were joined by seven supporting staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 3 for participant list). The demand-side experts discussed DRR needs as perceived by countries in the region, identified geopolitical interests or sensitivities, and postulated supply-demand matches. Since Covid-19 pandemic restrictions prevented in-person meetings, both supply- and demand-side convenings took place online and lasted about two hours each. During the demand-side convening, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted requests from some Indo-Pacific countries for assistance with health- and psychosocial-care needs to combat and counter the effects of the pandemic. Although the TriDeP team did not focus on pandemic disasters in the initial research phases, this report describes some of India’s supply-side telemedicine and psychosocial-care capabilities that could match demand-side requests for pandemic- and other health-related cooperation projects. Drawing on the desk research, interviews, and discussions with the TriDeP program team, and his own extensive experience in the field and personal familiarity with the actors, the author identifies 10 countries as potential TrC candidates and indicates their potential needs for equipment, services, and technical assistance that would increase the effectiveness of disaster risk management and response. In his selection of potential match countries, the author also considered complementary and competing DRR programs and activities already in progress with other providers. The author cautions, of course, that all DRR assistance proposals should align with host government priorities and that all recommended disaster management solutions must be fine-tuned and based on further contextual analyses. Pertinent facts about the 10 potential match countries and possible TrC initiatives are detailed in Annexure 4, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Maldives, the Philippines, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. In addition, the author presents disaster risk profiles for 16 other Indo-Pacific Region countries that may become candidates for TrC in the future: Brunei, Cook Islands, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Vanuatu (Annexure 5). The author’s TrC recommendations are consistent with the Intermediate Result (IR) 3.1 of the USAID India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS).2 The Asia Foundation is a non-profit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, its work across the region addresses five overarching goals – strengthen governance, empower women, expand economic opportunity, increase environmental resilience, and promote international cooperation. The TriDeP creates an opportunity for The Asia Foundation to examine emerging cross-cutting critical issues, such as disaster risk reduction, that warrant deeper investigation to inform its program strategies to ensure the Foundation remains at the leading edge of changing dynamics in the regional context – geopolitical, environmental, and legal/regulatory – and well-positioned to tackle the most critical issues facing Asia.

To be effective, all these elements must come together as a seamless whole. The policies, institutions, and logistics of disaster management are as important as the actual equipment used to rescue people – absolutely vital in handling disasters, in reaching to the last mile, and in determining the tools for effective and efficient action. Equally important is the involvement of disaster management practitioners in policy design and development – the domain and subject matter experts who understand the complexity and who know how to make disaster management policies, institutions, and logistics work together most effectively. Effective disaster management usually requires a long phase of development; time is the main challenge in setting up vital elements. Experts see India’s present disaster management approach as a journey that lasted just over two decades. It began at the time of super Cyclone Photographer: Fernando Quevedo de Oliveira Forest fires above Thak village in Uttarakhand, India in May, 2016. 16 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey ‘The Government of India and other stakeholders implemented recommenda- tions from a High Powered Committee (HPC). ‘The HPC’s report guided India’s disaster managernent approach from a relief-centric approach to one that embrac- es prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. fo strengthen India’s approach, the HPC. also made other recommendations: linking development efforts to disaster reduction; estab- lishing a disaster knowledge network, promoting interna- tional cooperation; applying a national disaster mitigation strat adopting a commu- nity-based approach; and fostering a culture of preven- tive thinking, The enactment of the National Disast ment Act and the de lop- ment of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and state- and district-level disaster n ‘ nt authorities (SDMAs and DDMAs) set the stage for India’s National Institute m of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 17 The National Policy on Disaster Management (2009) motivated community-based disaster management, last-mile integration of policy and plans, executional capacity development, consolidation of past initia- tives, deployment of best prs agencies at national and tices, cooperation with international levels, and multi-sectoral synergies. First announced in Novem- ber 2016 during the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Prime Minister's Ten Point Agenda restated DRR priorities, such as bolstering local capacities, enhancing, knowledge networks, and supporting international coalitions. The 2016 National Disaster Management Plan, subse- quently updated in 2019, provided a [ramework for disaster management plans at the ministerial, depart mental, state, and district levels. The Plan set out mechanisms for multiagency coordina- tion: the National Executive Committee (NEC), headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary at the national level, and the State Executive headed by a Chief Secretary mmiittee, at the state-government level.",

China and India have accused each other of firing shots during a Sept. 7 incident south of Pangong Lake, marking the first official claims of small arms fire on the border since 1975. While the situation in Ladakh had calmed down after the deadly June 15 melee in Galwan Valley, a resurgence of tensions is now occurring in a separate area of the disputed territory. Since Aug. 29, Chinese forces have allegedly been trying to cross into Indian controlled territory in the mountainous area between Pangong and Spanggur Lakes. India reportedly deployed troops to block these Chinese incursion attempts in several separate incidents. ...

Hack-for-hire firms cyber mercenaries operating as private intelligence operatives offer services ranging from phishing campaigns and email breaches to full-scale espionage. These groups, often masquerading as legitimate cybersecurity consultancies, target politicians, executives, activists, and rivals for clients including corporations, law firms, and even state actors. While India dominates this illicit trade, similar operations flicker across Pakistan, and Sri Lanka fueled by geopolitical tensions, economic incentives, and lax regulations. This article uncovers the notorious players, their tactics, and the global ripple effects, drawing from investigative reports and cybersecurity analyses. **The Indian Nexus: A Breeding Ground for Digital Guns-for-Hire** India’s hack-for-hire scene exploded in the early 2010s, spawning a web of firms that blurred the lines between ethical cybersecurity training and malicious operations. These entities often cater to private investigators, corporations, and even state actors, deploying spear-phishing, malware, and social engineering to infiltrate targets. One infamous operator, **BellTroX InfoTech Services**, a Gurugram-based firm that has become synonymous with the “Dark Basin” hack-for-hire syndicate. Discovered in 2017 by [Citizen Lab](https://redcanary.com/news/dark-basin-hacking-group-targeted-thousands-in-hack-for-hire-scheme/) researchers, BellTroX orchestrated a seven-year campaign phishing over 10,000 email accounts worldwide. Targets included high-profile figures: European politicians, Bahamian investors, U.S. executives from firms like KKR and ExxonMobil, South African judges, Mexican officials, and advocacy groups tied to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The operation, exposed in a 2020 [Reuters investigation](https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/exclusive-obscure-indian-cyber-firm-spied-on-politicians-investors-worldwide-idUSKBN23G1FI/), revealed BellTroX’s role in corporate espionage for clients such as the scandal-plagued Wirecard. A 2021 criminal complaint by India’s Internet Freedom Foundation, prompted by [Meta’s](https://internetfreedom.in/meta-belltrox-hack-for-hire/) takedown of 400 linked accounts, highlighted BellTroX’s brazen targeting of journalists and activists. Nearby in Gurugram, another Delhi suburb hub, WhiteInt emerged as a brazen player. In 2022, a report by **_The Sunday Times_** and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, covered by [Livemint](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indian-hack-for-hire-firms-target-vips-states-report-11667754842389.html), revealed that **WhiteInt**, offered paid hacking services to clients such as private investigators, powerful individuals, and even state actors. The firm reportedly uses phishing emails and malware to access victims’ emails, devices, cameras, and microphones. The head of WhiteInt, a 31-year-old man who also appears on TV as a cybersecurity expert, is accused of running this secret hacking network. According to the investigation, their operations extended to multiple countries, with victims including Pakistani officials, British lawyers, and wealthy individuals around the world. Further afield, firms like **Innefu Labs** and **Phronesis** Partners have drawn scrutiny for blurring lines between defense tech and offensive ops. was accused by [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/10/togo-activist-targeted-with-spyware-by-notorious-hacker-group/) in 2021 of maintaining infrastructure connections with the Donot Team spyware group, which had targeted Togolese activists, a claim the company firmly denied while continuing to expand its AI-driven surveillance technologies for Indian law enforcement agencies. **Phronesis** Partners, co-founded by retired Indian military cyber specialists, has been linked to advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns such as **Monsoon** and **Patchwork,** which allegedly involved deploying malware against Chinese nationals and regional adversaries, according to reports by FireEye. While both firms publicly present themselves as ethical cybersecurity providers, investigators suggest their activities may contribute to a broader network of cyber influence operations extending from the Gulf region to Southeast Asia. **Pakistani Shadows: Espionage in the Shadow of Rivalry** Pakistan’s cyber mercenary ecosystem operates in a fragmented, high-stakes arena, where state-sponsored espionage often blurs with freelance opportunism and underground collectives. Unlike the more structured Indian firms, Pakistani operations leverage a deep pool of ethical hackers and bug bounty hunters who moonlight in gray-zone activities, fueled by Indo-Pak rivalries and regional geopolitics. These groups, active on dark web forums, Telegram channels, and platforms like Upwork, offer services from $500 DDoS floods to $10,000+ custom espionage kits, targeting rivals across borders. **State-Linked APTs: Transparent Tribe and SideCopy-** At the organized end, groups like [**Transparent Tribe**](https://www.business-standard.com/external-affairs-defence-security/news/pakistani-hackers-may-have-hit-3-major-indian-defence-firms-find-out-which-124052801049_1.html) (aka APT36, ProjectM, or Earth Karkaddan) dominate, suspected of deep ties to Pakistan’s military and intelligence apparatus. Active since at least 2013, they’ve evolved tools like [ElizaRAT](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/pakistan-hackers-high-profile/), a remote access trojan for data exfiltration and ApoloStealer for credential theft, per Check Point’s 2024 analysis. Targets include Indian defense giants like Hindustan Aeronautics, the Indian Army, and Navy, with campaigns spiking post-2023 border tensions. BlackBerry’s report details lures mimicking DRDO (India’s defense R&D) docs to deploy malware, inadvertently linking ops to Pakistan via IP leaks and cultural artifacts in phishing emails. These aren’t pure mercenaries but hybrid actors, blending state funding with for-profit subcontracting. SideCopy, another Pakistan-attributed crew, overlaps with Transparent Tribe, focusing on spear-phishing against Indian military and diplomatic entities. Using decoy PDFs of classified docs, they’ve hit South Asian embassies and U.S. think tanks, per Cyble and QiAnXin’s 2023 alerts. Their modular malware updated quarterly suggests a semi-commercial model, possibly renting tools to regional clients. **Sri Lankan Circuits: From Civil War Echoes to Digital Fronts** Sri Lanka’s cyber scene bears scars of its civil war, where foreign mercenaries once trained local forces. Today, homegrown groups pivot to digital hire, though on a smaller scale. Sri Lanka is home to several cyber firms that have developed offensive capabilities either in ethical hacking or through association with major attack incidents though most public-facing companies operate within legal and regulatory bounds. **TechCERT and Sri Lanka CERT:** Both are renowned for not just defensive security but also **offensive cyber operations**, including penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and red team exercises to simulate real-world attacks on client infrastructure. Their offensive skills, deployed ethically, are key to keeping Sri Lankan businesses and government systems safe from both local and foreign threats. **Threatsys Technologies:** Widely cited for advanced penetration testing, simulation of cyberattacks, and red team engagements, Threatsys assists financial institutions and critical infrastructure providers in identifying weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them. The firm’s service offering highlights a growing offensive capability within Sri Lanka’s technology sector. **EGUARDIAN Global Services, Flix11, and eSec Forte Technologies**: These companies focus significantly on [offensive security](https://www.goodfirms.co/it-services/cyber-security/sri-lanka) measures such as digital forensics, vulnerability exploitation, and simulated attack scenarios for clients in telecom, fintech, and energy sectors. **Conclusion: A Digital Arms Race in the Shadows** The hack-for-hire ecosystem in the Indian Subcontinent, led predominantly by India and complemented by active operations in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, constitutes a sophisticated and clandestine domain of cybercrime and espionage. Indian firms like BellTroX InfoTech Services and WhiteInt, alongside Pakistan’s state-linked groups such as Transparent Tribe and SideCopy, and Sri Lanka’s dual-purpose cybersecurity entities like TechCERT and Threatsys Technologies, capitalize on the region’s technical expertise, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory ambiguities to deliver advanced hacking services. These operations, encompassing phishing, malware deployment, and high-level espionage, serve a diverse clientele including corporations, governments, and private entities resulting in widespread data breaches and compromised global security. While some organizations present themselves as legitimate cybersecurity providers, their activities often blur ethical boundaries, contributing to a burgeoning digital arms race with far-reaching implications.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

[Manish Singh](https://substack.com/@refsrc) Oct 07, 2025 24 [1](https://indiadispatch.com/p/india-grid-cannot-keep-up-with-its-ambitions/comments) 3 [Share](javascript:void(0)) India’s economic expansion and accelerating digitalisation are creating a surge in electricity demand that is exposing deep vulnerabilities in the existing power grid. The South Asian nation has committed to 500 gigawatts of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but the grid cannot yet reliably deliver clean power when and where it is needed. Supply will have to grow faster, be firmer and be more flexible than the system has ever delivered. If India captures a larger share of global data center investment driven by AI, this challenge will arrive precisely when the grid is least equipped to handle it. Goldman Sachs estimates that power required from utilities now needs roughly 7.2% annual growth between fiscal years 2025 and 2035, up from a prior 5.6%. The ratio of power growth to economic growth has been revised to roughly 1.06, versus roughly 0.85 before. Rising appliance ownership, electric vehicle charging and green-hydrogen pilots are pushing demand higher across the economy. The compute infrastructure supporting the digital economy is migrating from traditional IT rooms to industrial-scale data centres, creating a new and concentrated source of load that operates on a different scale than anything the grid has handled before. Hyperscalers say power is the first or second question in every investment decision when they evaluate potential data center locations. India’s data-centre base is still in the low single-gigawatts today, but Bernstein forecasts cluster around 5 to 6 gigawatts by 2030, provided interconnects and land clear on time. Jefferies’ top-end view reaches roughly 8 gigawatts, which at typical costs of 4 to 5 million dollars per megawatt implies 32 to 40 billion dollars of capital expenditure by decade-end. AI servers draw five to seven times the power of a legacy server rack, according to HSBC, creating disproportionate pressure on the grid. At scale, a 1 gigawatt campus needs roughly 1.3 to 1.5 gigawatts of constant supply depending on how efficiently the facility uses power, per Morgan Stanley. Power availability and connection queues now drive site selection as much as land price does, fundamentally altering the economics of where these facilities can be built. Data centres use only a sliver of India’s power today, but their share plausibly rises into the low single digits by fiscal year 2030 even in Nomura’s base case scenario. In a more aggressive scenario, consumption reaches 80 terawatt-hours, creating demand that would rival entire industrial sectors. Silicon wants electrons on a firm schedule that the current grid cannot reliably provide. India can construct utility-scale solar farms in 12 to 24 months (Mohit Bhargava, Senior Advisor to India Energy and Climate Center at UC Berkeley and former CEO of NTPC Green Energy said at a recent conference), which makes the renewable buildout look deceptively simple on paper. Reconciling that speed with the physics of electricity demand is proving harder in practice. Solar panels flood the grid when daytime demand is comparatively low, then fade precisely as households and commercial loads climb after 5 PM. On Goldman’s full-year models, the system runs a 1% to 4% energy deficit by fiscal years 2034 through 2035. Five-minute modelling of the peak week under adverse weather produces a deficit nearer 9%. This is not a morality tale about dirty versus clean energy sources but a timing problem that no amount of solar capacity alone can solve, no matter how many panels are installed or how quickly they are brought online. Coal plants can run around the clock and can ramp up production during the evening hours to meet surging demand. Legacy flexibility in the existing fleet complicates this seemingly straightforward solution in ways that limit how much solar the grid can absorb. Many Indian units struggle to operate at levels much below 60% to 70% of capacity, according to data shared by federal grid operator POSOCO. Operating at these minimum levels is crucial to keep the grid’s frequency stable, yet this makes it harder to absorb midday solar or respond to clouds passing overhead. Flexibility retrofits and revised operating norms matter as much as new megawatts in addressing this constraint, but the scale of the upgrades required is substantial. Assessments suggest India may need roughly 140 gigawatts of additional coal capacity by fiscal year 2035 versus 2023 levels. The government’s current target is roughly 87 gigawatts by fiscal year 2032. Some of this coal is bridge capacity to stabilise a faster-greening grid, not a repudiation of renewables, but the scale required exceeds what policymakers have publicly acknowledged or what most analysts expected even two years ago. Transmission infrastructure is the rate-limiter on the entire system, constraining how quickly renewable capacity can be added even when the generation itself can be built rapidly. The National Electricity Plan allocates about $110 billion for transmission through 2032, expanding the network from roughly 485,000 to roughly 648,000 circuit-kilometres and adding nine long-haul high-voltage direct current links totalling roughly 33 gigawatts. Typical interstate lines take 30 to 36 months to complete, and that timeline arrives before accounting for right-of-way fights and land acquisition disputes that routinely add years to the process. India’s present ability to move power through the system at high voltages is nowhere near what a continent-scale renewables-plus-data-centre system needs to function efficiently. Moving bulk power efficiently across regions will demand more substations, more support for maintaining stable voltage and more high-voltage direct current backbones than are currently funded or planned. The investment exists on paper, but the physical infrastructure lags years behind where it needs to be to support the generation capacity that is either already built or under construction. The constraints are already affecting major renewable developers in concrete ways. Reliance has land banks suitable for well over 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, but the ability to connect to the grid is the choke point affecting actual deployment of these projects. Its first 690 megawatt application at Khavda, a village in Bhuj Taluka of Kutch district, was granted connection capacity only by 2030, three years later than requested and larger blocks open from 2032 onward. Data-centre developers cannot sit in a transmission queue for years waiting for grid connectivity to materialize. They will gravitate toward firm electrons and existing infrastructure, not promises of future capacity that may or may not arrive on schedule. Energy storage is attempting to fill the gap between when solar generates and when demand peaks, but the scale required is enormous. Peak-week modelling suggests India could require roughly 530 gigawatt-hours of energy storage by fiscal year 2032, with about 420 gigawatt-hours plausibly delivered by batteries on current pipelines versus roughly 240 gigawatt-hours in government guidance. Battery pack prices have fallen roughly a third over the last two years, making solar-plus-storage economically viable for shifting midday power to early evening hours and covering short peaks that were uneconomic before. At multi-hundred-gigawatt-hour scale, supply chains, financing and siting still constrain deployment speed in ways that make it difficult to build fast enough. Storage is a powerful complement to transmission and flexibility, not a replacement for either, and it cannot by itself solve the problem of evening demand. Natural gas looks like a textbook bridge fuel on paper, offering the flexibility and reliability that the system needs. Except that cost and availability work against it in practice in the Indian context. Even under prospective liquefied natural gas gluts on global markets, gas-fired generation sits higher on India’s merit order than coal because of fuel pricing dynamics that have persisted for years. Image and projection: Goldman Sachs Gas will find a role as peaking capacity and locational reliability, especially where transmission infrastructure and urban substations are running at their limits, but it will not underwrite the nation’s evening ramp at scale on current economics. The math simply does not work at the volumes required to make a meaningful difference in the overall power balance. Time-of-day tariffs, interruptible contracts for large users and automated demand response can shave the peak and reduce the need for new generation capacity if deployed aggressively. These tools should be pursued because they can deliver results faster than building new plants or transmission lines and at a fraction of the capital cost. The political economy resists change in ways that make widespread deployment difficult. Distribution company finances are fragile, tariff reform is jagged and politically contentious, and enforcing sharp evening prices on voters is rarely a career-enhancing move for state governments that depend on those votes. Without that price signal, smart loads remain a pilot program rather than a resource at scale that can materially affect the peak demand problem. Institutions will decide the pace as much as technology does, determining which solutions can be deployed and how quickly they can scale. The Central Electricity Authority and Central Electricity Regulatory Commission set operating norms that determine how low coal plants can be run, how quickly they must ramp and what flexibility investments can be recovered through tariffs. State distribution companies control connection timelines and local capital expenditure decisions that affect every project. They also ration pain through load-shedding rather than pay for upgrades that stress their balance sheets and require politically difficult tariff increases. Land acquisition and right-of-way rules for the interstate transmission system pit national priorities against local politics and immediate constituent concerns in ways that delay projects for years. Open-access permissions, banking rules, and cross-subsidy surcharges tilt corporate buyers toward captive generation solutions instead of grid-beneficial ones that would help the broader system but offer less certainty to individual companies. China’s solution to data-centre load has been a coal-plus-renewables tandem buttressed by ultra-high-voltage transmission lines that move power thousands of kilometres across the country. The country built firm capacity and a long-haul backbone first, then stacked wind and solar behind it once the grid could handle the variability. It is not clean by any measure, but it is stable and predictable in ways that enable industrial planning. Texas offers a cautionary mirror on the other end of the spectrum: a torrent of wind and solar capacity, relatively light interconnections between regions, and a price-only market that invites curtailment and volatility during extreme weather events. That system is now being partly tempered by a wave of battery installations, but the integration challenges remain significant. India cannot copy either model wholesale given its own institutional constraints and geography, but the lesson is the same everywhere. Get the transmission infrastructure and the operating rules right before promising 24-hour clean power to compute campuses that require uninterrupted supply. Most commentary fixates on long-distance transmission lines as the primary constraint limiting renewable deployment. The near-term crunch may actually be distribution infrastructure at the local level, which receives less attention but creates immediate bottlenecks. Data-centre parks and peaking plants need substations at various voltage levels, high-capacity feeders, and fault-level upgrades inside cities already operating at thermal and political limits. Who pays becomes key in determining what gets built and when: developers via hefty connection charges, or distribution companies via capital expenditure they can barely finance given their debt loads and tariff constraints. Connection queues and local reinforcement requirements may add as much delay as the interstate lines that dominate public discussion, creating a two-tier bottleneck that affects different projects in different ways. Avoiding a false binary choice is essential when considering how much coal versus everything else the system needs to manage the transition. A plausible fiscal year 2035 mix that manages the evening peak includes several components working together in ways that complement rather than substitute for each other. A large block of new coal capacity operating flexibly during the 6 PM to 11 PM hours when demand surges past what renewables can provide. An upgraded legacy fleet with lower minimum operating levels to absorb midday solar without destabilising the grid’s frequency or forcing curtailment. Hundreds of gigawatt-hours of batteries shaving intraday swings and covering the first hour of the peak before other sources take over. A modest wedge of gas for location-specific reliability and fast start capability where transmission constraints prevent coal from serving certain areas. A growing contribution from time-of-day tariffs and demand response as state politics allow and distribution companies become more financially stable. The exact shares will move with prices, weather patterns and policy choices as the decade progresses, but the direction is clear regardless of which specific path policymakers choose. India will add coal to buy time for transmission, storage and demand-side tools to catch up with the modern economy’s arrival, even as it continues building renewable capacity at record rates. The digital economy is arriving faster than the physical grid can adapt to handle its demands. Transmission lines take years to plan, approve, and construct under the best circumstances. Solar panels go dark at the worst moment for system reliability, creating precisely the gap that needs to be filled. Batteries are powerful tools but not yet cheap enough at the scale required to make evening peaks disappear entirely, despite the dramatic cost declines of recent years. Hydroelectric plants and nuclear reactors face long lead times and public resistance that delay their contribution to the grid mix, often by a decade or more from initial proposal to operation. Given these timelines, the dependence on high-carbon baseload power will rise before it falls, creating a period where emissions may increase even as renewable capacity expands. Policymakers cannot pretend otherwise or deny the contradiction between clean energy goals and near-term infrastructure realities. Thanks for reading India Dispatch! Subscribe to receive new posts.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

Translate potential to sustained performance](https://prod-cm.worley.com/prod-cm.worley.com#four) **Daniel Law, Senior Group Director, Strategy, and Jamie Garden, Vice President, Sales, share insights on India’s pivotal energy transition and the strategic bets that will determine long-term success.** India is at a defining moment. By 2047, India will mark 100 years of independence with an ambition to transform into a developed economy or ‘Viksit Bharat’. Central to that ambition lies a massive energy transition: rewiring a coal‑reliant economy into one powered by green hydrogen, renewables, and electrified mobility. This shift is anything but linear. To explore what’s ahead, we collaborated with the [Fletcher School at Tufts University](https://fletcher.tufts.edu/) to model three possible scenarios that could shape the arc of India’s future: - **Aspirational India**(8–9% annual GDP growth): India goes all-in. Aggressive institutional reforms, high capital investment, and coherent policy coherence push India into a golden era of growth. India achieves 85%+ renewable energy in its power mix and becomes a global clean-tech hub. - **Momentum India**(6–7% growth): Steady progress with structural constraints. The green ambition advances – but coal remains king in many states. Renewables scale, but grid limitations and policy patchwork slow integration. Hydrogen and CCUS inch forward, but cost parity remains elusive. - **Constrained India**(4–5% growth): Growth is hindered by fragmented governance, infrastructure bottlenecks, and delayed reform. Coal dominance persists, and green capital is cautious, reducing the effectiveness of energy transition efforts. Missed opportunities in workforce development or industrial policy could delay India’s demographic gains. These aren’t theoretical – they demand real choices now. The strategic bets global firms make today – on infrastructure, partnerships, and local execution – will determine whether they ride India’s growth wave or miss it. How these scenarios play out will be further influenced by how organizations navigate market forces and identify and overcome challenges. In the following sections, we explore how CEOs can meet these challenges – not just to survive India’s complexity, but to turn it into a durable competitive advantage. ## Four challenges for the India Decade and how to transform them into a competitive advantage ### 1.Managing a ‘multi-India’ reality For many global CEOs, India’s headline numbers are enticing: 7%+ growth, rising middle-class consumption, and bold green energy ambitions. But behind the macro story lies a sobering operational reality – India isn’t one big market, it’s 28 different ones. For global firms used to national uniformity, India’s federal complexity often defies standard market approaches. Each state operates with its own regulatory lens, economic maturity, infrastructure readiness, and political dynamics. The differences are striking. Maharashtra tops GDP charts and is a magnet for private capital; Tamil Nadu is fast emerging as an EV manufacturing powerhouse. Meanwhile, states like Bihar remain largely agrarian, with limited industrial infrastructure or energy grid modernization. In fact, just six high-growth states account for nearly half of India’s GDP but attract more than 75% of private infrastructure investment. Even in energy transition, regional disparities shape the pace and model of progress – India added 113 GW of new generating capacity in 2024, mostly renewables, but that growth was highly concentrated in a few progressive states. A national strategy that ignores this nuance is, at best, an oversimplification – and at worst, a recipe for missteps. National initiatives could stall in lagging states. Capital could get locked in mismatched regulatory environments. Partnerships can falter when local dynamics are misunderstood. _**Solution: Shift from an ‘India strategy’ to a ‘portfolio of India’s strategy’.**_ Think of India less as a country and more as a continent, where relevance and scale are earned one region at a time. With that mindset, CEOs should build state-level playbooks. Prioritize no-regret states for green energy deployment. Embed local regulatory affairs teams that understand subnational nuances. Structure partnerships to be modular, not monolithic. At Worley, we turned this ‘multi-India’ challenge into a catalyst for opportunity and expansion that has allowed us to tap into a diverse talent pool across major urban centers, develop local expertise hubs and remain close to the headquarters and operational units of our customers. We do this through a decentralized network of offices across eight strategic locations in India. For example, our offices in Mumbai and Bangalore are strategically located close to the headquarters of major customers such as Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla Group, and multinational corporations like Shell. Our Vadodara (Baroda) office is ideally situated to support India’s chemicals hub, while our Kolkata office serves as a center of expertise for the metals and mining sector, for both domestic and international customers. ### 2\\. Timing green investments amid a coal-constrained base India is advancing toward an ambitious green future – 90% clean energy by 2047, full EV adoption, and scaled green hydrogen. But the road there is anything but linear. While India has made significant progress by scaling its solar and wind infrastructure in the last decade, coal still remains the backbone of India’s power sector – over 70% of electricity generation and a critical source of industrial employment. In 2024, coal-fired generation hit a record high of 1,221 terawatt hours, with another 80+ GW of new coal capacity planned by 2032. The opportunity in renewables, hydrogen, battery storage, and biofuels is real but fragmented, with rollout timelines varying dramatically across sectors and states. The challenge isn’t just picking sectors and technologies. The fundamental dilemma is when to invest. Jump in too early, and capital risks being stranded amid policy reversals or affordability constraints. Wait too long, and lose out on early-mover advantages to fast-moving competitors. In a landscape this uneven, timing is everything. **_Solution: Think in layers, not leaps._** A winning strategy in India doesn’t require binary decisions between fossil and green – it requires balancing long-term bets with transitional hedges. Fundamentally, it’s about sequencing bets in step with local policy signals, state‑level readiness, cost curves and the social realities of India’s energy landscape, to build optionality. Companies should initially invest in hybrid models like solar + green hydrogen, clean coal technologies, or dual-fuel systems near industrial hubs. These offer flexibility while preparing for policy and market inflections. At the same time, CEOs should aim to co-locate and co-create projects to ensure success. For example, anchor projects near steel, cement, or chemical clusters where industrial off-takers are actively decarbonizing. It will also be important to phase projects and investments alongside state-specific reforms – such as open access policies, renewable purchase obligations, or utility decarbonization targets. At Worley, we have adopted a balanced approach to the evolving energy landscape globally. Our strategy is to have a balanced portfolio that seeks to play in, and bridge, both traditional and sustainable segments. Our early work in traditional sectors has since evolved into a strategic partnership helping drive customers’ sustainability agenda. When customers have announced their net-zero ambitions, we are their trusted engineering partner. ### 3\\. Collaborating with India’s ‘Three Titans’: PSUs, family‑owned conglomerates, and agile privateers India is not just a growth market, but a strategic arena shaped by established power structures. For multinational corporations (MNCs), the real challenge isn’t just solution-market fit – it’s system-market fit. India’s industrial landscape is anchored by three powerful forces: 1) large Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) with policy influence; 2) powerful family-owned conglomerates like Reliance and Tata with legacy networks, land access and synergistic edge across the value chain; and 3) fast-moving, tech-savvy first generation entrepreneurs or private players backed by domestic and foreign capital. These Titans are market-makers and they help set price expectations, steer regulatory outcomes, and command the supply chains that MNCs often struggle to penetrate. The scale of these Titans is formidable. India’s top 10 conglomerates account for over 20% of GDP. The combined value of India’s top three family-run businesses is on par with Singapore’s GDP. For global players, aligning with these engines of growth is often more productive than competing head-on. **_Solution: Complement global expertise with local strategic partnerships._** Winning in India doesn’t mean outspending incumbents – it means embedding yourself where they need global capability. Whether it’s advanced tech or IP, digital infrastructure, or a global footprint of experts, MNCs can offer what local giants don’t have in-house. Structured right, partnerships can offer mutual de-risking: local players bring distribution, land, and on-ground intelligence; MNCs bring IP, compliance rigor, and global networks. CEOs may consider smart moves involving strategic minority stakes, co‑investments, or joint ventures in domestic green energy, digital platforms, or AI‑enabled supply chains. These investments can be value accretive, especially as next-gen leaders of Indian family businesses seek to globalize, credible international partners are increasingly welcome. Worley’s strategy in India is anchored on complementing our global expertise with local strategic capabilities. We believe that our core value proposition to customers is our global expertise and footprint. Our strong network of SMEs and global project experience spanning 44 countries have been instrumental in shaping this, especially in nascent sectors such as low carbon hydrogen and battery materials. This has allowed us to bring a unique value proposition to India’s powerhouses and to diversify our customer base across a balanced mix of the three Titans. ### 4\\. Translate potential to sustained performance For global companies, India’s promise is undeniable – its scale, demographic edge, and accelerating energy transition make it a critical growth market. But translating potential into performance is another matter entirely. India’s regulatory environment reflects its democratic and federal complexity, requiring navigation, not shortcuts. For multinationals conditioned by institutional predictability, this can stall execution before it even begins. In the renewable energy sector, for example, a single project can require upwards of 50 approvals spanning central and state agencies. Timelines can vary by 300% across states. Yet, despite these challenges, India drew $13.7 billion in clean energy investments in 2022 — proof that the upside is real for those who can navigate the system. Add in the complexity of workforce dynamics. India is home to the world’s largest working-age population, but only a fraction is in formal employment, and female labor force participation is one of the lowest globally at just 20%. Over-reliance on expats or transactional partnerships often limits adaptability and erodes long-term capability. The result: a paradox of abundant labor but constrained access to skilled, employable talent – especially outside urban centers. **_Solution: Build an exceptional, localized talent pool for execution._** To ensure sustained performance, CEOs need to build an ‘India-first’ leadership pipeline with deep sectoral and functional experience in the country, not just cross-market generalists. Additionally, local leadership must be empowered with full P&L ownership, moving from HQ‑centric decision-making to locally embedded hubs with real authority to adapt, negotiate, and deliver. CEOs must also invest in attracting top-tier talent and upskilling them through focused initiatives – upskilling and gender inclusion aren’t CSR, they’re foundational infrastructure for growth. Partnering with academia and government will build education-to-employment bridges, especially in Tier 2 and 3 cities where future demand and talent will rise. At Worley, our local leadership team are all Indian nationals by intention. While we tap into our global network for SMEs, our operational, sales and functional leaders in India are also locals with a rich industry experience. Attracting and retaining exceptional talent is key to ensuring long-term success. We actively collaborate with universities across India – not just urban centers – to identify the best talent. For example, in 2024, Worley India partnered with 66 universities as part of our graduate recruitment program, with 60% of graduates being women. We foster a culture that promotes continuous learning both on-the-job and through structured classroom training programs. Over 200 leaders in India have participated in Worley’s flagship leadership development program – STEP. The message is clear: succeeding in India requires more than presence – it demands strong local capability, agility in operations, and a willingness to treat execution capability as the new competitive edge. ## Worley in India: Built for Complexity, Ready for the Future At Worley, India isn’t a satellite – it’s a core engine of our global capability. With almost 7,000 professionals across eight regional hubs, we’ve been embedded in the Indian landscape for more than four decades.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) After many years of infrastructure development and gradual encroachment, China is accelerating efforts to secure its military presence and access to water rights along the Indian border near Ladakh. But while it appears Beijing has largely achieved this objective for now, the harsh Himalayan winter could again escalate its standoff with India by challenging China's ability to maintain a presence throughout the disputed territory....

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

Until New Delhi addresses the underlying grievances spurring unrest in Kashmir Valley, its residents will continue to oppose Indian rule. (TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP/Getty Images) Kashmir is known throughout South Asia for its natural beauty, which draws visitors from far and wide. But beneath the region's alluring exterior, deep-seated grievances are beginning to jeopardize its stability. On July 8, Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, the 22-year-old commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant separatist group that calls for the India-administered portion of the region (Jammu and Kashmir) to join Pakistan. The organization's fighters regularly sustain casualties, but Wani's death set off widespread protests in the state's capital, Srinagar. In an effort to contain the situation, New Delhi temporarily shuttered at least four major Kashmiri newspapers, cut off mobile phone and internet access to the region, and imposed a curfew that has yet to be lifted. These measures have not stopped the demonstrations, however, and clashes between protesters and security forces have left more than 50 dead and 3,000 injured. New Delhi has pointed the finger at...

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power.

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

The outcome could set a precedent for renewable energy developers facing transmission bottlenecks, as India accelerates its clean energy rollout. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fsustainability%2Fboards-policy-regulation%2Findian-power-regulator-takes-up-solar-firms-plea-losses-due-transmission-delays-2025-10-06%2F) In the filing posted over the weekend, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is examining whether the Power Grid Corporation of India [(PGRD.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/PGRD.NS) and the Central Transmission Utility of India, the institutions responsible for setting up transmission infrastructure, should compensate developers for losses. CERC has asked both to respond within six weeks. The developers, ACME Solar [(ACMO.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ACMO.NS) and AMPIN Energy, argued in separate petitions that they suffered financial losses due to their inability to transmit power from their solar projects due to delays in operationalising transmission infrastructure. The Gurugram-based ACME Solar is seeking more than 210 million rupees in compensation, while AMPIN Energy did not specify its losses. CERC has directed the Central Transmission Utility and Power Grid to submit details on the transmission system, commissioning timelines, and reasons for the delays. The petitions are scheduled to be heard on November 27. Power Grid and the Central Transmission Utility did not immediately respond to Reuters' email seeking comments. India has been forced to [curb](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/india-curbs-solar-power-output-keep-grid-stable-amid-low-demand-ministry-says-2025-08-19/) solar output during periods of low demand to maintain grid stability and ease congestion, as renewable energy supply rises and transmission projects lag. Rajasthan, India’s top green power-producing state, has seen nearly 4 gigawatts of clean energy curtailed, with estimated losses of up to 2.5 billion rupees ($28.16 million), according to the Rajasthan Solar Association.

    "full_text": "Between April and August 2025, at least 30 solar plants were forced to cut output, losing nearly `700 crore (Photograph: Reuters) Published on: 01 Oct 2025, 10:58 am India’s efforts to expand solar and wind power seem to have hit a roadblock. Project developers allege that due to a lack of adequate transmission infrastructure to carry the electricity they generate, dozens of commissioned plants, ready to feed power into the grid, are being forced to sit idle and incur losses. “Between March and August 2025, at least 30 solar and wind plants faced curtailment, with combined losses of up to Rs 700 crore,” chief commercial officer with a renewable project told Down To Earth ( DTE), requesting anonymity. Experts say such curtailment is shaking investor confidence and could jeopardise India’s target of installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based electricity capacity by 2030. The Union Ministry of Power is responsible for laying transmission lines or upgrading existing ones when approving power projects—whether coal-based or renewable. Once a plant is commissioned, it requires general network access (GNA) from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to begin transmission. However, GNA has not been issued to several newly commissioned solar and wind power plants in the high-generation states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, according to manufacturers who spoke with DTE on condition of anonymity. These plants are instead granted temporary general network access (TGNA). This temporary access, usually valid for up to 11 months, allows electricity to be fed into the grid, but only when there is low supply to the lines. “During the six months till August 2025, we were instructed by the Grid Controller of India to embrace curtailments of up to 48 per cent of our daily production...

These constraints limit the pace at which new capacity can be brought online. India’s transition to renewables is limited by the mismatch between variable generation and grid consumption. While solar generation aligns with the afternoon peak consumption pattern, it tapers off in the evening when demand is high. This creates a gap that limits renewable integration and leads to the underutilisation of transmission corridors. Energy storage is vital to bridge this gap. Renewable corridors often operate below their intended capacity; however, some degree of underutilisation is temporary, as it reflects strategic overbuilding to meet future demand growth. Transmission planning needs to move beyond the traditional five-year static cycle to a more adaptive approach that reflects evolving generation patterns and demand growth. India’s power transmission network, one of the largest in the world, spans over 494,000 circuit kilometres (ckm) of lines and 1.33 million megavolt-amperes of transformation capacity, forming a fully synchronised national grid. However, the network struggles to keep up with renewable energy deployment, leading to a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of evacuation infrastructure. This imbalance limits renewable integration and increases the risk of stranded assets and higher delivery costs. The widening gap between planned and actual transmission network expansion is becoming evident. In FY2025, only 8,830ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253ckm, reflecting a 42% shortfall, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade. Alongside this capacity gap, system inefficiencies are emerging, with analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicating that up to 71% of ISTS corridors operate below 30% utilisation, underscoring the mismatch between infrastructure availability and actual power flows. Market distortions further aggravate the situation. In several high-demand corridors, speculative hoarding of transmission capacity by entities without genuine project intent has driven up connectivity prices and delayed access for viable projects. Structural and procedural bottlenecks, including right-of-way (RoW) disputes, prolonged land acquisition processes, restrictions on equipment procurement, and multi-agency approval requirements, add to the delay. Among these, RoW remains one of the most significant barriers to timely transmission development. Similar land acquisition hurdles in the US have also slowed new transmission build-outs. In India, the impact is most visible in Rajasthan, where 8 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity remains stranded, with nearly half curtailed during peak solar hours. Delayed completion of the Associated Transmission System—the dedicated transmission infrastructure linked to new generation projects—along with capacity hoarding and ecological directives mandating underground cabling in Great Indian Bustard habitats, have compounded evacuation challenges, inflated project costs, and reduced operational efficiency. The implications are significant—over 50GW of renewable energy capacity is currently stranded nationwide, increasing per-unit transmission costs, weakening project viability, and deterring private investment. These constraints limit the pace at which new capacity can be brought online and undermine India’s ability to integrate variable renewable energy at scale, risking missed milestones in the country’s clean energy transition. A unified generation-transmission planning framework that aligns timelines and locations for both generation and transmission capacity additions is essential. A single-window clearance system with strict timelines should be implemented to streamline land, RoW, and connectivity approvals. Performance-based incentives and disincentives tied to asset utilisation metrics can encourage timely commissioning and sustained operations. Scaling asset monetisation and public-private partnerships will be essential to unlocking capital for both inter-state and intra-state projects. In parallel, reconductoring of congested corridors and integration of energy storage systems should be prioritised in renewable-rich regions to enhance capacity utilisation and reduce curtailment. A coordinated approach—combining regulatory reform, operational efficiency measures, and capital mobilisation—will be critical to transforming India’s transmission network into a flexible, resilient system capable of supporting high renewable penetration while ensuring cost-effective and reliable power delivery. The recent extension of ISTS charge waivers for storage and the implementation of time block-based General Network Access allocation—which allows power generators to use the transmission network without pre-identifying buyers—are steps in the right direction. Without targeted reforms, misalignment between generation commissioning and evacuation infrastructure is likely to continue driving congestion, curtailment, and systemic inefficiencies, ultimately slowing progress towards achieving India’s decarbonisation objectives. ### Vibhuti Garg Vibhuti Garg is the Director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), where she leads efforts to advance sustainable development through strategic policy interventions in energy pricing, subsidy reforms, innovative business models, and market design.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Equity securities may fluctuate in value and can decline significantly in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions. Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk (as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk. These effects are usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Currency Risk is a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another. Whenever investors or companies have assets or business operations across national borders, they face currency risk if their positions are not hedged. Generally, among asset classes, stocks are more volatile than bonds or short-term instruments. Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns. U.S. Treasury Bills maintain a stable value if held to maturity, but returns are generally only slightly above the inflation rate. © 2025 State Street Corporation - All Rights Reserved.

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances.
