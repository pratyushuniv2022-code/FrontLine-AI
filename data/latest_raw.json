The flow of pertinent contemporary political events made closure difficult, and my own academic and administrative and other professional commitments forced me to put it aside from time to time. With the help and generosity of Karen Colvard of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, Mark Juergensmeyer was able to assemble Ainslie Embree, Jack Hawley, W. H. McLeod, Bruce Lawrence, and David Rapaport in Hawaii in September 1991 for a two­day discussion of the first draft, completed a month earlier. Their comments, and those of Karen Colvard, were encouraging, thoughtful, and helpful. By the time of the Hawaii discussions, the Hindutva movement in India and the various processional campaigns of the Hindu nationalists to build a temple to Ram in Ayodhya at the site of the Babri mosque had intensified, while also provoking some violent incidents. Also in 1991, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had its first notable electoral success and became India's largest opposition party. I therefore determined to add a substantial account of the Ayodhya issue to this book. In 1992, I began the projected chapter on the Ayodhya debate, but I soon realized that this not only required lengthy treatment but also raised issues that were outside the scope of a book focused on collective violence. In fact, I found myself writing a second book, and having more or less followed the events associated with the Ayodhya issue to the climactic demolition of the mosque in December 1992 and the aftermath of violence and political consequences, I returned in the summer of 1993 to the text of the first manuscript. After delays caused by various academic commitments, and after taking into account advice to include at least a brief chapter on Hindu ethnonationalism and its political impact, I managed in early Au­ Page x gust 1995 to complete this book, covering events in India and Pakistan up to around 1992–93. It is hoped that a second book dealing with Hindu nationalism, the demolition of the Ayodhya mosque, and the alleged crisis of secular politics in India will be written in due course. It is difficult to give a coherent account of the motivations that directed the writing of this book. Having already published two short books exclusively focused on the current painful and prolonged ethnonationalist conflict in Sri Lanka, and living at a time of explosions in many places of ethnonationalist violence, all seemingly sharing a family resemblance, I found myself realizing that there were substantive and theoretical issues of a general and comparative nature that invited study. South Asia seemed a manageable arena to visit for selected case studies and comparative study. Especially as regards recent developments in India and Pakistan, I do not claim much expert and ''original\" knowledge, although I am no stranger to these countries. I stood on the shoulders of many others to put together my narrative. I did not begin this book because I already knew what I wanted to say. I only knew what I wanted to find out. I did most of my learning during the reading and writing process. I also benefited from co­teaching two seminars at Harvard on nationalism, pluralism, ethnicity, and violence with Nur Yalman and Begonia Aretxaga. I naturally expect readers, especially the experts, to evaluate this book according to their standards, but I hope they will not condemn me for my audacity and my willingness to take risks. I wish to thank the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation for giving me a grant to visit India. Friends have kindly provided me with relevant documents, and I thank in particular Diana Eck, Bina Agarwal, H. L. Seneviratne, and Ashkutosh Varshney. I am especially indebted to Rebecca Grow for typing the bulk of the book manuscript, a task efficiently completed by Annemarie Bestor and Nicole Thornton­Burnett, and to Dan Rosenberg for a close reading of the proofs for mistakes and for compiling an informative index. Finally, I must express my appreciation for those associated with University of California Press—particularly Doug Abrams Arava, Erika Buky, and Peter Dreyer—for overseeing the production of this large and complex book. Page 1 PART ONE SELECTED SITES OF CONFLICT IN SOUTH ASIA Page 3 1 The Wider Context A somber reality and disillusionment of our epoch, which emerged from the ashes of World War II, is that although there have been successes in the push toward development and modernization, eradication of disease, and the spread of literacy, economic and political development programs have generated and stimulated, whether by collusion or in reaction, in good faith and poor anticipation, massive civil war and gruesome interracial and interethnic bloodshed. The same epoch has witnessed the rise in many countries of repressive authoritarianism in both military and democratic guises, equipped with Western weaponry, inflamed by populist slogans and fundamentalist doctrines, and assisted by a flagrant manipulation of the mass media, which have vastly expanded their reach. The optimism of the sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists who naively foretold an \"integrative revolution\" and the inevitable decline of \"primordial loyalties\" such as kinship, caste, and ethnicity in third world countries, has by now waned and dimmed. The introduction of constitutions and democratic institutions, enshrining human rights, universal franchise, the party system, elected legislatures, majority rule, and so on, has often resulted in strange malformations that are far removed from the goals of liberty, justice, and tolerance that were the ideological supports of Western European and North American liberal­democratic syntheses. Something has gone awry in center­periphery relations throughout the world, and a manifestation of this is the occurrence of widespread ethnic conflict, accompanied in many instances by collective violence among people who are not aliens but enemies intimately known. Page 4 The Ubiquity of Ethnic Conflict At different times, certain ranges of phenomena, grouped under embracing labels such as \"social class,\" \"caste,\" \"race,\" \"gender inequality,\" ''modernization,\" \"the colonial encounter,\" and so on, have become foci of intensified scholarly interest. Then these inquiries fade away, not only because of diminishing marginal returns, but also because the phenomena themselves, as reflected on the screen of history, either lose their salience or are transformed into other events, which are more revealingly grouped under new labels. One such label subsuming a range of phenomena with a family resemblance is \"ethnicity.\" It is significant that the term ethnicity has come into vogue and found its way into standard English dictionaries, especially since the 1960s. Linguistic, national, religious, tribal, and racial divisions and identifications, and competitions and conflicts based on them, are not, of course, new phenomena, yet the recent salience of the term ethnicity \"reflects a new reality and a new usage reflects a change in that reality\" on a global scale in the latter half of the twentieth century, both in the industrialized first world and the \"developing\" third world. 1 It seems that the term ethnicity gained popularity in the social science literature of the 1960s and early 1970s, not only to describe certain manifestations in the third world, but also in reaction to the emergence of ethnic movements in the industrialized and affluent world, especially in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe.2 And since the dismantling of the USSR and the other communist regimes of Eastern Europe, the spate of internal conflicts that have exploded there are also viewed as ethnic and ethnonationalist in kind. Ethnic conflict is a major reality of our time. This is confirmed, not simply by its ubiquity alone, but also by the cumulative increase in the frequency and intensity of its occurrence. According to a recent enumeration, some forty­eight countries (including the republics that have supplanted the USSR) are experiencing ethnonationalist conflicts of one kind or other. Since the 1960s conflicts have occurred or been perpetuated between anglophone and francophone in Canada; Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland; Walloons and Flemings in Belgium; Chinese and Malays in Malaysia; Greeks and Turks in Cyprus; Turks and Kurds in eastern Turkey; Basques and Spaniards; Jews and other minorities on the one hand and Great Russians on the other; Ibo, Hausa, and Yoruba in Nigeria; and East Indians and Creoles in Guyana.3 Add to these upheavals that have become climactic in recent years, among them the Sinhala­Tamil war in Sri Lanka, Page 5 the Sikh­Hindu and Muslim­Hindu confrontations in Kashmir, and the turmoil engendered by the Ayodhya temple dispute; the Chackma­Muslim turmoil in Bangladesh, the actions of the Fijians against Indians in Fiji, the Pathan­Bihari clashes in Pakistan, and preceding the recent political settlement, the inferno in Lebanon, and the erosion of human rights previously manifest in Israeli actions in Gaza and the West Bank and the assassinations exchanged between Israel and the PLO; and, finally, the century­old difference exploded again between Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis in March 1988. 4 Eastern Europe has been on the boil since the vast Soviet empire was dismantled, and old \"nationalities\" have been resurfacing and jostling for power and for separate recognition. The death toll has been rising in the republics of the former USSR in tandem with the politics of secession.5 In Yugoslavia, at first the Slovenes and Croats were ranged against the Serbs and declared their independence, and we have read daily since 1992 about the triangular warfare and carnage in Bosnia­Herzegovina between Serbs, Croats, and Muslim Slavs. Another recent phenomenon is the exodus of refugees from Albania into Greece and Italy. And the list lengthens every month.6 It is this parade of disasters (on top of two world wars, economic crises, and authoritarianisms of the right and left) that probably prompted Isaiah Berlin to say, \"At eighty­two, I have lived . . . the worst century Europe has ever had.\" Most of these conflicts have involved violence, homicide, arson, and destruction of property. Civilian riots have evoked action by security forces, sometimes to quell them, sometimes in collusion with civilian aggressors, sometimes both in sequence. Events of this nature have happened in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, India, Zaire, Guyana, and Nigeria. Mass killings of civilians by armed forces have occurred in Uganda and in Guatemala, and large losses of civilian lives have been recorded in Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Rwanda. Some dissident ethnic groups have declared secessionist aims that threaten to break up extant polities, and these aims in turn have invited invasion of one country by another (for example, the Somali invasion of Ethiopia), or armed intervention, such as by India in Sri Lanka in 1987. Moreover, ethnic conflict has also frequently caused massive displacements of people, many of them being deposited in refugee camps in neighboring countries, as in Africa, the Middle East, India, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Nor, finally, should we forget large­scale expulsions of people, as happened to Asians in Uganda in the 1970s.7 Page 6 The escalation of ethnic conflicts has been considerably aided by gun­running and free trade in the technology of violence, which not only enable dissident groups to resist the armed forces of the state, but allow civilians to battle one another with lethal weapons. The classic definition of the state as the authority invested with the monopoly of force has become a sick joke. 8 After so many successful liberations and resistance movements in many parts of the globe, the techniques of guerrilla resistance are now systematized and exportable knowledge. Furthermore, easy access to the technology of warfare by groups in countries that are otherwise deemed low in literacy and in economic development—we have seen what Afghan resistance can do with American guns—is paralleled by another kind of international fraternization among resistance groups—who have little in common save their resistance to the status quo in their own countries, and who exchange knowledge of guerrilla tactics and the art of resistance. Militant groups in Japan, Germany, Lebanon, Libya, Sri Lanka, and India have international networks of collaboration, not unlike—perhaps more solidary than—the diplomatic channels that exist between mutually wary sovereign countries and the great powers. There are, of course, global politico­economic processes at work, which cause disparities between countries, structure metropolitan centers and peripheries into configurations of uneven development, and stimulate neighbors of unequal power and status to confront one another. Another development, not unknown in the past in the form of mercenaries for hire, but today reaching a sinister significance, is the \"privatization of war\"—that is, the ability of governments with extraterritorial geopolitical aims to fight their foreign wars, not by committing their own professional armies, but by farming out contracts for subversive military and political action to private professional groups willing to be hired or capable of being mobilized. The employment of ex­SAS (British Special Air Service) veterans by the Sri Lankan government to help in the war against the Tamil militants is one of many such examples. Analogously, the lessons the United States learned in Vietnam were later applied with zest in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, where local dissidents were armed and trained in the use of weaponry and the arts of destabilization. Professionalized killing is no longer the monopoly of state armies and police forces. The internationalization of the technology of destruction, evidenced in terrorism and counterterrorism, has shown a face of free­market capitalism and long­distance trade in action unsuspected by Adam Smith and by Immanuel Wallerstein. The ubiquity, the increased frequency and intensity, of ethnic conflict, serviced by modern technology of destruction and commu­ Page 7 nication, and publicized by the mass media, makes such conflict a special reality of the late twentieth century. Faced with recent disturbances in South Russia, Mikhail Gorbachev was moved to say that \\[ethnic\\] nationalism was the \"most fundamental vital issue of our society.\" 9 And on a visit to Yugoslavia, a country that has a long history of tensions between \"nationalities,\" he is reported to have said, \"Show me a country without nationalist problems, and I will move there right away.\"10 What a shift there has been in historical consciousness from Victorian times to the computer age of instant information! The Victorian perception of the people of the world was, as we well know, that they could be placed on a ladder of evolution and progress, with the Europeans at the summit. Other peoples were not really contemporaneous with the West, and archaeological metaphors such as \"survivals\" and the ''contemporaneity of the noncontemporaneous\" (a phrase coined by Karl Mannheim) were used to describe a global population whose development was assumed to be both uneven and discontinuous. Edward Tylor gave a vintage expression to this consciousness when he wrote: The educated world of Europe and America practically settles a standard by simply placing its own nations at one end of the social series. The principal criteria of classification are the absence or presence, high or low development, of the industrial arts . . . agricultural, architecture, etc., the extent of scientific knowledge, the definiteness of moral principles, the conditions of religious belief and ceremony, the degree of social and political organization and so forth.11 This Victorian perspective in the main persisted perhaps until World War II, but there has been a recent change in paradigms, positing common world historical processes that hold centers and peripheries in one dialectical and interlocked field. There are specific developments that have contributed to a shift in historical consciousness that views our present world as a global village. The revolution in the media, instant transmission of visual images and auditory messages, linking metropolitan centers and distant places, and wide coverage of events, so that news broadcasts (whether by NBC, CBS, ABC, or CNN) present diverse events occurring at diverse places as a single synchronic and simultaneously occurring reality. These communication processes bind us in a synchronicity of fellow witnesses of world events. We come to feel that the worldwide incidents of ethnic conflict are of the same order and are mutually implicated: strife in Northern Ireland; kidnappings in Lebanon; beatings on the West Bank; fire bombings in Germany; killing of civilians in Sri Lanka; riots against the Sikhs in Delhi; massing of Korean youth against a rightist government; attacks on Page 8 the \"bush negroes\" by the townsmen of Suriname, sniping by the Contras in Nicaragua, explosive tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, unrelenting Serb attacks on the beleaguered Muslim Slavs of Bosnia, mutual massacres of Tutsi and Hutu—all belong to a contemporary world suffused by violence. The internationalization of violence and the simultaneity of its occurrences viewed on our TV screens make us all spectators and vicarious participants responding with our respective sympathies and our prejudices. The Politicization of Ethnicity A major issue today is the transition from the politics of the nation­state to the politics of ethnic pluralism. It is useful at this juncture to take as our point of reference Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism (1983), in order to recognize its contribution and also to go beyond it to take account of newer developments. Immanuel Wallerstein contends that after its inception in Europe in the sixteenth century, world capitalism spread like a tidal wave from the metropolitan capitals and gradually inundated the peripheries. The versions of the \"dependency\" theory of world capitalism variously proposed by Wallerstein, André Gunder Frank, Paul Baran, Samir Amin, and Claude Meillassoux all in the end posit a monolithic global historical process. However, they leave out of account the parallel process by which the world was fragmented, differentiated and carved up as \"nation­states.\" Anderson shows how easily the modular concepts of the ''nation­state\" and \"nationalism\" were pirated by third world colonial and postcolonial elites. Under colonialism, the \"historical consciousness\" of nineteenth­century Europe was transmitted to and imbibed by local elites subjected to the textbook learning propagated by colonial schools. In Anderson's account, historically speaking, it was the creole communities of Latin America, the former colonies of Spain, that developed \"the conception of nation­ ness well before most of Europe.\" Simultaneously \"a colonial community and an upper class,\" the creoles mounted the first national liberation movement against the Spanish empire. Anderson's plotting of the rise in Europe of national consciousness in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, inspired by linguistic and vernacularizing revolutions, followed from the mid nineteenth century on by the promotion and manipulation of \"official nationalism\" by the European monarchies, based on a national identification projected onto vernacular languages, led him quite correctly to perceive that the nation­building policies of the new states of the third world consisted of \"both a Page 9 genuine, popular nationalist enthusiasm and a systematic, even Machiavellian, instilling of nationalist ideology through the mass media, the educational system, administrative regulations, and so forth. In turn, this blend of popular and official nationalism has been the product of anomalies created by European imperialism: the well­known arbitrariness of frontiers, and bilingual intelligentsias poised precariously over diverse populations.\" 12 A weakness in Anderson's thesis, especially when we contemplate developments in pre­ and postindependence India (a country he does not discuss), is his suggestion that nationalism in the colonies and the third world was largely a more or less passive or borrowed response to the European impact. An examination of India's nationalist discourse as articulated by three different personalities—the \"early\" thinker Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay; Mohandas Gandhi, who consolidated the national, while decrying the modern; and Jawaharlal Nehru, who married the national to the agency of the state—suggests that, although indeed derivative and mostly taking the form of \"passive revolutions,\" the colonial and postcolonial responses were also dialectically engendered and filtered through the experiences and motivations of differently positioned local elites and leaders, whose voices were by no means unitary and homogeneous. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, in the decades immediately preceding independence, while the dominant voice of the politicians of the Ceylon National Congress and their successors (including D. S. Senanayake and S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike) was collaborative with the British Colonial Office, there were other distinctive oppositional voices, such as that of Anagarika Dharmapala, the father of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism, and the radical communists and Trotskyites, whose rhetoric was revolutionary and anticolonial. Anderson's Eurocentric sequencing is, in fact, locked into the project of nation­state making, as, indeed, is the more complex \"derivative discourse\" proposed by Partha Chatterjee,13 and both have to be taken a stage further, which requires a radical transformation of their master narratives. The politics of the newly independent states, framed initially in terms of \"nation­state\" ideologies and policies, have by virtue of various internal dialectics and differences led to a new phase of politics dominated by the competitions and conflicts of \"ethnic collectivities,\" who question unitary nationalist and \"nation­state'' dogmas. The politics of ethnicity is indeed a product of the interweaving and collision of the two global processes we mentioned earlier: world capitalism and its operation through multinational corporations, and widespread nation building by liberated colonies now ruled by Page 10 elite intelligentsias, who, however, have to react to their divided civilian constituencies. These interacting global processes, while having certain homogenizing effects, have simultaneously spawned differentiation and opposition within the new polities, manifested as ethnic conflict. We have recently discovered with shocked surprise that the politics of ethnicity is not only a main preoccupation of the newly independent countries of the third world, but has emerged with a vengeance in what used to be called the second world: the recently dismantled Soviet empire and its erstwhile satellites in Eastern Europe. The dismantling and dismembering of the earlier formations have resulted in the creation and the demand for creation of new states on an ethnonationalist basis, and thereby the intensification of ethnonationalist conflicts, of which the Azerbaijani­Armenian conflict over Nagorno­Karabakh, and the triangular struggles between Croats, Serbs and Muslims in what used to be Yugoslavia are the most spectacular. There appear to be two interrelated developments in this part of the world, which are characterized by both positive and negative features. The collapse of totalitarian political systems has opened space for their replacement by democratic regimes. While one can see the obvious virtues of democracy and representative government compared with totalitarian Communist party rule, yet the fact is that the alleged changeover to electoral democratic methods in Eastern Europe (and the Commonwealth of Independent States) has actually unleashed and/or intensified ethnic conflicts, and ethnic majorities have used their electoral dominance to inferiorize and assault or displace their minorities (while seceding former minorities do the same to their own minorities). This phenomenon of \"ethnic cleansing\" reached its most virulent climax in the former Yugoslavia with a battery of devices: food blockade, incessant shelling, causing the flight of people from their homes, killing of captured \"enemies,\" systematic raping of women (causing them to become pregnant, so that they will carry the enemy's children—inasmuch as the Serbian, Muslim Slav, and Croat peoples are strongly patrilineal and male­dominated, the father's ethnic identity primarily determines the child's). The second development concerns the effects—particularly in the short term—of the dismantling of the command economies of the former USSR and Eastern European countries and the change to market economies and free enterprise. Here various economic ills—the hijacking of enterprises by the bureaucracy in place; increasing unemployment, caused by the closing of inefficient firms; black­market operations; and the lack or weak functioning of capital, labor, and commodity markets—have fed into the frag­ Page 11 mentation and uncertainties of sociopolitical systems increasingly dislocated by ethnic conflict, fascist racist propaganda, and ethnic cleansing. Simultaneously, we are also witnessing a shakeup in the confidence and complacency of Western Europe, which has recently shown disturbing evidence of chauvinism, racism, discrimination, identity panic, and a thrust toward national separateness, accompanied by attacks on foreign workers and migrants, as economies worsen and unemployment rises. The Maastricht Treaty, with its hope of a unified currency, is falling apart; the concept of Europe as an entity is being questioned by British, Danish, and lately French misgivings; the European Community is suffering the strain of differential national economic interests. Britain has a history of racial problems vis­à­vis its West Indian, Pakistani, and Indian emigrants; and the German fire­bombings of Turkish guest workers and French assaults on Algerians and other North Africans led by Jean­Marie Le Pen and his Petits Blancs raise the specter of incipient racism, which mercifully is rejected, if not firmly resisted, by millions of citizens. Our complacent assumptions of civilizational progress have been shaken. Lessons swept under the carpet and conveniently forgotten are resurfacing: that democratic politics and free­market capitalism have their prerequisites, their sociocultural conventions and contexts, and their own constructed myths; that they are not immune from their own internally generated contradictions and tensions; that they are not pills that surely and automatically cure illness. There is another recipe for progress that is currently being tested: the idea of the nation­state as the desirable basis for structuring political life, a previously hegemonic concept that is currently undermined by regional and subnational resistances. The Nation­State in Crisis and the Rise of Ethnonationalism An alternative title to this section might be \"A Tale of Two Nationalisms.\" Ignoring the many nuances, there are two models of nationalism that are in interaction, as well as contention, in many parts of the world. Each model has its benefits and its costs, and our existential task at the close of the twentieth century is to find a way of reconciling the two and of constructing a new synthesis in the political lives of collectivities of people. First, there is the nationalism of the nation­state, which was historically conceived and substantially first realized in Europe, particularly Western Europe. Second, there is what I call ethnonationalism, which has arisen Page 12 separately in many parts of the globe. Ethnonationalism has had and continues to have its European formulation and presence in (parts of) Germany, and today more vigorously in Eastern Europe. It also manifests itself in distinctive and similar ways in many other parts of the world—in Africa, in the Middle East, in South and Southeast Asia, and in Latin America. Ethnonationalism in its variant forms is most definitely not solely a Western construction. Regional and minority ethnonationalist movements in earlier empires and conquest states historically predate the appearance of the nation­state in Western Europe. Being more general in its stimulus, ethnonationalism has independently emerged at many different sites, although today global processes may drive them to converge. In their global role as imperial powers, the nation­state's European progenitors sought to transplant the form to their third world dependencies and colonies, a process that accelerated with decolonization after World War II. Its impact on the social forms and practices of these erstwhile colonies in fact brought into prominence an intensified form of ethnonationalism in regional reaction to the excessive or unwelcome centralizing and homogenizing policies of the nation­state. In Eastern Europe, a similar imposition after World War I of the nation­state blueprint on a terrain differentiated by linguistic, religious, and ethnic cleavages, followed by the subsequent imposition on the same terrain after World War II of authoritarian communist regimes, has been succeeded today by an outbreak of ethnonationalist and regional claims that are competitive, divisive, intolerant, and violent, as well as euphoric and full of aggrandizing ambitions and collective promises for the participants. It is this historic meeting, collision, and dialectic between the project of nation­state making and the counterclaims of ethnonationalism that provides the primary focus for this book. It is suggested that what is happening in the countries of South Asia (and in many other newly independent third world countries) is not very different from what is happening in Eastern Europe and the newly founded Commonwealth of Independent States. The Nation­State as a Historical Construction In its Western European form, the secular nation­state was predicated on the ideals proclaimed by the French Revolution, on the one hand, and the universalist claims of Enlightenment rationalism, on the other. Essential components of this nation­state were separation of church and state (and the virtual privatization of religion), the conception of citizenship based on the formal equality of all individuals who are its members; the jurisdiction Page 13 of the nation­state as valid in the territory that it covers and that is defined by its frontiers; and finally, the arguable notion that politics is a secularized domain of activity shaped by its own objectives of power and by its own logic and rules. The secularization of politics carried distinctive entailments, which are worth underscoring. In Western European history, the separation of church and state, and the relegation or confinement of religion to the private domain, was linked to the stimulation given the scientific revolution and experimentation by certain trends in Protestant Reformation thought. In maintaining that God had instituted the laws of nature, and that scientists could legitimately discover these laws, the Protestant Reformation thereby also in the long run had opened the door for God to become otiose or distant with regard to the pursuit of science. The scientists' religious beliefs and attachments, if they had any, were supposedly irrelevant to establishing the laws of science. Historically, the development of the Western nation­state was linked to the launching of the Industrial Revolution, and the impulsion of capitalism as an expansionary force, creating wide­ranging, interlocking markets for goods, relatively free geographic mobility of labor, and a progressive erasing of parochial boundaries. Capitalism was a dynamic homogenizing agent in the newly industrializing countries. It also generated the expectations and hopes of a continuing economic expansion, despite \"temporary\" slumps and downturns. The expectation of economic growth and expansion generated aspirations to social mobility, cultural homogenization, and more egalitarian distributions of wealth. We may also introduce into this heady mix another tendency: the drive to create a national culture, usually around a common dominant language, which gains precedence over other dialects or minority languages. (Switzerland is an exception in this respect.) The growth in literacy rates, linked to expanding educational facilities, and opportunities, and the explosion of cheap printing are other integral components of the Western success story. In the creation of the Western nation­state, political integration, continuous economic expansion, and, frequently, linguistic homogenization for administrative purposes and for \"high\" cultural productions went hand in hand. The concepts of nation and state were fused into an entity, the bounded nation­state. And in the end, above all, national identity required from the citizen a loyalty to the state conceived of as a secular entity. This Page 14 was the ideal­typical construction, claiming normative authority, whatever the deviations in actual fact. Now, since the secular nation­state has been advocated by many Western theorists and third world intellectuals and political leaders as the bedrock on which modernization and economic development can be raised, it is extremely relevant to bear in mind two warnings. First, historically, the Western European nation­state was achieved as the end result of very special developments, including social upheavals, internal strains, revolutions, and divisive wars between states. (We tend to forget this when we are impatient with the problems of governance and economic development in other countries.) Second, there is the possibility of a fundamental fallacy being perpetrated when an attempt is made to impose a historical construction such as the nation­ state, achieved on distinctive soil, on a dependent world, as if its realization were a necessary stage in Universal History. This supposition, derived from Enlightenment assumptions, perhaps has near \"hegemonic\" status in global affairs (although in Europe itself it has been questioned and contested). What happens—and indeed how do we perceive and represent and interpret what happens—in many parts of the world where the events that led to the realization of the European secular nation­state have not taken place, are slow to take place, take place unevenly, or are actively resisted as harmful (as for example in Iran by Shiite fundamentalism or in India by Hindu nationalists)? Is it now time to shift from the language of \"obstacles\" to \"development\" to the language of active subaltern \"resistance\" to it? In trying to sort out these issues, it is relevant to consider that the other side of the Western model of the secular nation­state is its aggressive nationalism and imperialist expansion and penetration into what became its colonial dependencies. Liberal democracies in Western Europe and the United States frequently imposed authoritarian rule abroad, the exploitation of native labor and resources, and the inferiorization, if not erosion, of the cultures of the colonized. Marxists explain these processes in terms of capitalism gaining a new lease on life through colonial exploitation. This inferiorization and threat of cultural extinction in large part lies behind the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, Buddhist \"nationalism,\" Hindu nationalism, and other such reactions, and their retaliatory attitude to Western economic affluence and domination, political supremacy, alleged consumerist values, celebration of sexual eroticism, erosion of family durability, alleged \"privatization\" of religion and separation of religion from affairs of state, and so on. Page 15 The Three Phases of Independence Keeping in mind that their political objective was the establishment of nation­states, we may discern three phases in the political history of third world countries like India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Guyana, and Nigeria, which received their independence soon after the end of World War II. The characteristic issues of each phase are stated in terms of the ideological rhetoric and distinctive labels used by politicians and academic commentators alike. (I do not intend these phases to be taken as discontinuous shifts but merely as showing different emphases.) The first stage was the actual \"decolonization\" process itself, when Western imperial powers, following World War II, \"transferred power\" to local elite groups. Decolonization was preceded and accompanied by violence when, as was the case with Algeria, the colonized fought a \"war of liberation.\" In other colonies, such as Sri Lanka and Burma, the transfer of power was more peaceful, although not entirely without the staging of civil disobedience movements and other forms of resistance, such as, for example, those mounted in India by the Indian National Congress and in Malaya by the communist guerrillas. India underwent the horrific trauma of Partition, the political and economic and social consequences of which continue to have grave costs. The second phase, spanning the late 1950s and gathering momentum in the 1960s, was characterized by optimistic and even strident claims in the newly independent countries about their objectives of \"nation making,\" strengthening \"national sovereignty,\" creating \"national culture\" and \"national identity,'' and achieving \"national integration.\" The slogans of the time accented \"national\" dimensions, and in doing so played down and wished away internal diversity and social cleavages in favor of the primacy of nation­states as the accredited units of the United Nations and the modern world system. Frantz Fanon's book The Wretched of the Earth, with its programmatic celebration of \"national consciousness,\" \"national culture,\" and \"national literature\" in African states newly delivered from the chains of colonialism, belongs to this phase. Fanon proclaimed that \"to fight for national culture means in the first place the fight for the liberation of the nation, that material keystone which makes the building of a culture possible.\" 14 For many intellectuals of South Asian origins, it was Jawaharlal Nehru, in his autobiography and his much­read book The Discovery of India, who eloquently preached the promise of Indian nationalism and cultural renaissance wedded to the organizing institutions of the state, a marriage that would deliver social justice, economic growth, and scientific progress.15 Page 16 This phase of optimistic nation building was enacted as the work of \"national coalition governments,\" examples of which were Nehru presiding over the monolithic Congress Party; Cheddi Jagan, an East Asian, and L. F. S. Burnham, a Creole, heading the People's Progressive Party in Guyana in the early 1950s; Tengku Abdul Rahman presiding over the Malaysian Alliance, again in the 1950s; and D. S. Senanayake's leadership of the United National Party in Ceylon in the same period. Political parties seemed willing to collaborate, rather than emphasizing their separate interests and their special constituencies. This phase was also marked by confident expectations of expanding economic horizons, instanced by faith in economic planning and growth and the spawning of \"five­year plans\" funded by foreign aid, whose smooth flow, it was hoped, would make the world safe for capitalism and democracy. In a dislocating and sometimes disconcerting manner this hopeful, expansive phase of nation building has been put to the test and even reversed in the third phase, from the 1960s onward, by the eruption of ethnic conflicts. The divisiveness has revolved around issues of language, race, religion, and territory. Accordingly, there has been a shift again in slogans and concepts. Ethnic groups and ethnic conflict are the salient labels for talking about these events. The terms plural society, devolution of powers, traditional homelands, and self­determination—old words given new force and urgency—have begun to frame the political debate and academic analyses. The central political authority, the state, which in the previous phase of nation building and economic growth was designated as the prime actor and central intelligence in initiating, directing, and controlling the country's future and historical trajectory, is now, after years of escalating ethnic divisiveness and pluralistic awareness, counseled to be a \"referee,\" adjudicating differences and enabling regional cultures and societies to attain their \"authentic\" identities and interests. In our present phase of ethnonationalism, characterized by the politicization of ethnicity, there are two salient features. The ethnic groups qua groups demand and bargain for collective entitlements (the concepts of individual rights and individual identity are secondary here), and it is usually a majority group that demands affirmative action on its behalf to put to right an alleged historical injustice, thereby once again giving new content to affirmative action, which is usually undertaken on behalf of depressed minorities and underclasses. What I call ethnonationalism relates to the generation of regional or subnational reactions and resistances to what is seen as an overcentralized and hegemonic state, and their drive to achieve their own regional and local Page 17 sociopolitical formations. Now let me enumerate four issues that have posed problems with regard to nation­state making and \"modernization\" in newly independent and so­called developing third world countries, and that have increasingly generated the politics of ethnonationalism. They are the four rocks on which the nation­state project has foundered: 1. The question of what the language or languages of education and administration ought to be, and of whether to replace English with swabasha (indigenous languages), is a postcolonial problem that has taxed countries with plural languages, such as India, Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, which all have their own written languages and literatures. The ramifications of this language issue are many. 2. Closely related is the \"modernization\" program that has entailed the launching of ambitious literacy and educational programs. The result has been an explosion of literacy in the context of a population explosion, and the creation of large numbers of educated or semi­educated youths seeking employment in economies slow in growth and unable to accommodate them. It is this category of unemployed youth at urban sites that has everywhere been the most visible and activist participant in ethnonationalist movements and ethnic riots. 3. A major divisive and contentious issue, generated by economic development and modernization in countries of low income and high­population density and rural underemployment, is large­scale population movements and migrations that cause dramatic speedy changes in the demographic ratios of peoples in a region who perceive themselves as different on the basis of ethnic origins, religion, length of residence, and so on. Myron Weiner has proposed two hypotheses concerning \"the social and political consequences of internal migration in a multi­ethnic low­income society\": (a) \"that the process of modernization, by providing incentives and opportunity for mobility, creates the conditions for increasing internal migration\"; and (b) ''that the modernization process nurtures the growth of ethnic identification and ethnic cohesions.\" 16 The second proposition is especially true when migration and the collision of groups produces \"competition for control over or access to economic wealth, political power and social status\"; and when there is a strong concept of \"territorial ethnicity\"—the notion that certain ethnic groups are rooted in space as bhumiputra (sons of the soil), especially among the indigenous folk of the region into which migrants are coming; and when migration changes the demographic balance and the mix of ethnic groups within a given space. Migrants belonging to a particular ethnic group may move in from the periphery to work in subordinate positions to the ethnic Page 18 group or nationality predominating in the core region. This situation results in a \"dual labor market\" and applies to Turkish and Greek guest workers in Germany, Moroccans in France, and Mexican labor migrants to the United States, who frequently become depressed minorities victimized by discrimination. Quite different outcomes ensue, however, when the population flow is in the opposite direction—that is, when the migrants have skills and capacities superior to those of the locals and come to enjoy affluence and social prestige. This second situation can become particularly acrimonious and contentious, especially in postcolonial and postindependence times, when power shifts to and is exercised by the most numerous, usually the local \"sons of the soil,\" who then wish to displace these successful so­called \"aliens\" and newcomers. Frequently, this thrust coincides with the \"indigenous\" or local population producing its own educated youth, who aspire to move into occupations held and enterprises managed by the migrants. Such moves to displace people in favored positions are particularly acute when the avenues of employment in the modern sector are not expanding fast enough to incorporate the number of entrants among the locals into the ranks of the middle class. When such bottlenecks occur, the successful migrants are viewed as obstacles to the social mobility and well­being of the indigenous majority. I need mention only these well­known examples in illustration: in northeastern India, in Assam and Tripura and elsewhere, the collisions between the local hill tribes and the incoming West Bengali Hindu and Bangladeshi Muslim migrants; in Pakistan, the animus against the Muhajir who migrated to Sind after Partition and became prominent in Karachi; in Uganda, Idi Amin's expulsion of Indian merchants and professionals; in Fiji the tensions between Fijians and Indian immigrants. With the dissolution of the USSR, many Russian professionals and administrators who had been sent or migrated to the various non­Russian republics were faced with similar displacement by \"indigenous\" populations. 4. The fourth issue pertains to the degree of viability of secularism as specified in Western nation­state philosophy in civilizational contexts of the sort prevailing in many parts of the world—in the Middle East, in South and Southeast Asia, and elsewhere—where many persons reject the relegation of religion to the private domain and are earnestly committed to the idea that religious values and beliefs must necessarily inform politics and economic activities. The vexed issue is how to implement this world­view in a context where multiple religions with distinctive practices, and whose followers differ in their numbers, exist together in the same politi­ Page 19 cal arena. It has been asserted that India has been the home of a concept of secularism, different from the Western one, in which the state, rather than excluding religion from politics, is exhorted to be evenhanded in its dealings with multiple coexisting religions that give direction to the lives of their adherents. Mahatma Gandhi, who once said that those who want to separate religion from politics understand neither, is held to be the quintessential proponent of the distilled wisdom of India that religions must and can coexist in a spirit of tolerance and mutual respect within the same polity. Precedents for this were allegedly set by two celebrated Indian rulers, Asoka, who ruled over most of India, except the deep south, in the third century B.C., and whose \"righteous rule\" was influenced by Buddhist values of tolerance and nonviolence, and the sixteenth­century Moghul ruler Babur, who ecumenically reached out to Hinduism. These are indeed glorious precedents. But recent developments in India in the form of Sikh fundamentalism and the cry for Khalistan, and in the form of Hindu nationalism, propagated and propagandized with great effect by such organizations as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), and that generated the Ayodhya temple dispute (the Babri Masjid­Ram Janmabhumi clash), are putting India's capacity to negotiate a viable relation between a unified polity and sectarian religio­politics severely to the test. There are similar developments in neighboring countries, including Sri Lanka. The conundrum that faces many of us South Asians is this: while we all should make the effort to comprehend and appreciate the reasons for the rejection of Western secularism by certain religious communities, we also have to face up to the question of what policy to put in its place in an arena where multiple religious communities with divergent political agendas contest one another and make claims that threaten to engender discrimination and inequality among citizens who in principle must enjoy the same civil rights and should peacefully coexist. Page 20 2 Orientation and Objectives The Modern Discourse of Ethnicity and Ethnic Identity By discourse, I mean the aggregate of speech acts, utterances, interactions, and practices that together constitute a shared arena of public conduct for a collectivity of people. Ethnic identity is above all a collective identity: we are self­proclaimed Sinhalese, Malays, Ibos, Thais, and so on. It is a self­conscious and vocalized identity that substantializes and naturalizes one or more attributes—the usual ones being skin color, language, religion, and territorial occupation—and attaches them to collectivities as their innate possession and their mytho­historical legacy. This is a \"primordialist\" claim. The central components in this description of identity are emotively charged ideas of inheritance, ancestry, and descent, place or territory of origin, and the sharing of kinship, any one or combination of which may be invoked as a claim according to context and calculation of advantages. These ethnic collectivities are believed to be bounded, self­producing, and enduring through time. Although the actors themselves, invoking these claims, speak as though ethnic boundaries were clear­cut and defined for all time, and think of ethnic collectivities as self­reproducing, bounded groups, it is also clear that from a dynamic and processual perspective, many actors, as well as outside commentators, recognize that there are many precedents for \"passing\" and change of identity, for incorporations and assimilations of new members, and for changing the scale and criteria of collective identity motivated by dynamic contextual considerations. From this perspective, ethnic Page 21 labels and membership are \"instrumental\" in construction and manipulable and porous in application. There is also a third, \"constructionist\" perspective, which is allied to the \"instrumentalist\" view. Borrowing a phrase from Benedict Anderson, we may say that it characterizes ethnic collectivities as \"imagined communities,\" 1 in the sense that the members of the collectivity, although scarcely sharing interpersonal relations and face­to­face familiarity, are persuaded by disseminated literary manifestoes and media messages transmitted by ideologues that they are a community sharing origins, traditions, and aspirations. There has been an expansion of their mental horizons and subjective imaginings. Ethnicity embodies and combines two interwoven processes, which constitute its double helix. One is the substantialization and reification of qualities and attributes as enduring collective possessions, made realistic and imaginable by mytho­historical charters and the claims of blood, descent, and race. This results in what has aptly been called \"pseudo­speciation\"—that is, the collectivities in a certain sociopolitical space think of themselves as being of separate social kinds. Internal unity and homogeneity, and external difference and opposition, are integral to this condition. The other contrapuntal and complementary process is that ethnic boundary­making has always been flexible and volatile, and ethnic groups have assimilated and expanded, or, in the opposite direction, differentiated and segmented, according to ideological causes and persuasions, historical circumstances, and political­economic possibilities. Ethnic identity unites the semantics of primordial and historical claims of distinctiveness with the pragmatics of calculated choice and opportunism in dynamic contexts of political and economic competition between interest groups. Ethnic groups, especially in contemporary times of widespread ethnic conflict, seem to be intermediate between local kinship groupings (such as lineages, clans, kindreds, and so on) and the nation as a maximal collectivity. Moreover, especially marked in the modern context, and within that context conspicuous in many third world societies, is the mounting awareness that ethnic affiliation and ethnic identity are overriding other social cleavages and superseding other bases of differentiation to become the master principle and the major identity for purposes of sociopolitical action. This state of affairs therefore raises the possibility that ethnicity (projected upon the old bases of identity in terms of language, \"race,\" religion, and place of origin) as a basis for mobilization for political action has challenged and is challenging the primacy for such mobilization of social class Page 22 on the one hand and the nation­state on the other. Therefore, in a general analysis, two relevant issues that need to be kept in mind are: to what extent and in what way ethnicity modifies, incorporates, or even replaces class conflict as a major paradigm for interpreting social conflict and change; and also in what manner ethnicity has influenced the aims and activities of nation making and national integration, which were taken to be the principal tasks of the newly founded third world nation­states. In the transition from the politics of the nation­state to the politics of ethnic pluralism, what I call \"the politicization of ethnicity\" is the moving force (see chapter 12 for further development of this idea). In a systematic discussion of ethnic conflict, many issues can be brought within the ambit of an interpretive framework that addresses questions of how ethnic groups in an arena see themselves as acquiring, maintaining, and protecting their alleged group entitlements to capacities and \"symbolic capital\" such as education and occupation, to \"life chances\" and material rewards such as incomes and commodities, and sumptuary privileges that enable distinct styles of life, and to ''honors\" such as titles and offices, markers of ethnic and national pride, and religious and linguistic precedence and esteem. These honors are accorded by the state or other authorities that are the principal arbiters of rank. In this proclamation and pursuit of invidious \"group entitlements,\" power, prestige, occupations, material goods, aesthetic judgments, manners and morals, and religious convictions come together and naturally implicate one another. Religion is not purely a matter of belief and worship; it also has social and political resonances and communitarian associations. Likewise, language is not merely a communicative device but has implications for cultural identity and literary creation, educational advantage, occupation, and historical legitimation of social precedence. Similarly, territory has multiple implications, which go beyond spatial location to include charged claims about \"homelands\" and \"sons \\[and daughters\\] of the soil.\" We have to comprehend an arena of politics in which, as Donald Horowitz puts it: \"Fundamental issues, such as citizenship, electoral systems, designation of official languages and religions, the rights of groups to 'special position' in the polity, rather than merely setting the framework for politics, become the recurrent subjects of politics.\" 2 Quests for group worth, group honor, group equalization, and so on are central foci in the politics of ethnicity and a critical ingredient in the spirals of intense sentiments and explosive violence that ensue. Page 23 \"Communalism\" as Colonial Discourse The word communalism has come to South Asianists from a special usage under the British Raj. The rivalries and collisions of \"religious,\" \"linguistic,\" ''regional,\" and \"racial\" groupings were all considered expressions of communalism. In colonial India and Ceylon, and subsequently in postindependence India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, this concept has been invoked and used with different affective and evaluative connotations and implications, but overall in a negative and condemnatory sense. Let us begin with a recent imputation that has had high visibility. In his \"subaltern\" text The Construction of Communalism in Colonial North India (1990), Gyanendra Pandey has powerfully argued that in India the British used the attribution of a Hindu­Muslim communal divide (\"communalism\") as a master narrative to explain all riots and public disturbances in which Hindus and Muslims (and others) were involved, and moreover, to characterize quite a few incidents in which no trace of \"communalism\" can be found in the historical record. 3 Moreover, when carefully dissected, what were seen as massive outbreaks of sectarian violence between Hindus and Muslims would seem to show internal competition between Hindu upper and lower castes, and especially the social ambitions of mobile castes espousing religious orthodoxy, to be more salient than a monolithic Hindu­Muslim divide.4 Moreover, a long line of historians, politicians, and other commentators have accused British administrators of employing \"communal\" divide­and­rule tactics to foment local factionalism and thereby wield undisputed authority and maintain magisterial rule. This conspiracy theory no doubt has many persuasive affirmations (although it has also been overextended by some accusers). But there are also occasions and times when communalism was invoked by the British as a bad thing, which they had to resist, and it was also considered in the same vein by Indian liberals. Especially during the last phase of British rule in India and Ceylon, when the colonies were being gradually prepared—according to the rhetoric of official imperial declarations—for representative government and self­rule, religious and other minorities seeking separate electoral rolls, reserved seats, special quotas, and other forms of protection were often criticized by the commissions sent out from London to hold hearings and to craft new constitutions for subscribing to divisive \"communal\" interests and jeopardizing democracy (although the commissioners did, in fact, make such special provisions wherever they thought it necessary). Page 24 It is particularly interesting for us that South Asian liberal (and socialist) nationalist politicians clamoring for the end of colonial rule and preparing for the realization of their own nation­states after independence were also by and large forced to face the insistent demands of \"communalism.\" They tended to react to them in two ways, one as requiring corrective reform, where they evidenced social injustice for depressed groups, and the other as requiring political criticism and denunciation, where they were perceived as being potentially used by the \"bourgeoisie\" or the ''middle classes\" to influence and dupe the masses in order to gather support for policies that furthered their own privileged \"class\" interests. A revealing example is Jawarharlal Nehru, whose liberal­socialist position on communalism was followed or supported by the liberal intelligentsia of the colonial nationalist movements. Especially when it came to the \"depressed classes\" (Gandhi's harijans, later also labeled \"scheduled castes\" and \"scheduled tribes\"), Nehru and the Congress leaders were convinced that all invidious social and customary barriers that stood in the way of their full development individually and collectively should be removed, and that educational and economic opportunities ought to be provided them in order to get rid of their disabilities as rapidly as possible. Thus affirmative action in favor of the depressed and backward classes championed by B.R. Ambedkar was much discussed in the constitutional debates and translated into legislative action. But the attitudes of Nehru and his liberal stalwarts hardened where they perceived that members of a small reactionary upper middle class and bourgeoisie within each community exploited \"communalist\" sentiments and demands to further their own political interests. Both Nehru and Gandhi did sympathetically see why minorities like the Muslims feared being swamped by the Hindu majority, and honestly tried to teach Congress supporters why it was the obligation of the Hindus to be sensitive to such fears and to set the example of showing tolerance. But it was felt that the demands of communalism must be resisted, especially because religious passions among the people at large could easily be aroused, since they were accustomed to think in terms of religious cleavage and constantly encouraged to do so by communal religious organizations and government action, as well as by certain political elites. Nehru observed: It is nevertheless extraordinary how the bourgeois classes, both among the Hindus and the Muslims, succeeded, in the sacred name of religion, in getting Page 25 a measure of mass sympathy and support for programs and demands which had absolutely nothing to do with the masses, or even the lower middle class. Every one of the communal demands put forward by any communal group is, in the final analysis, a demand for jobs, and these jobs could only go to a handful of the upper middle class. There is also, of course, the demand for special and additional seats in the legislature, as symbolizing political power, but this too is looked upon chiefly as the power to exercise patronage. These narrow political demands, benefiting at the most a small number of the upper middle classes, and often creating barriers in the way of national unity and progress, were cleverly made to appear the demands of the masses of that particular religious group. Religious passion was hitched on them in order to hide their barrenness. 5 A thesis that has had strong support in the past among both left­wing and liberal scholars and politicians and journalists, and that still continues to be voiced by many, is that communalist politics, which involves political parties and organizations, especially espousing religious and caste and linguistic claims allegedly on behalf of their respective masses, is best understood as the instrumental and self­serving pastime of upper­middle­class and mobile entrepreneurial elites, who stand most to gain by riding to power on this electoral platform. And since they are the literate and educated and have professional skills, they profit most from affirmative action and minority entitlements. It would be foolish to deny that this thesis (and one kind of master narrative) has merit and provides one perspective for deconstructing communalist politics and revealing its basis. And at least to some of us investigating the widespread, almost worldwide, eruptions of conflicts that are currently called \"ethnic\" or \"ethnonationalist,\" it is also clear that there are more features at work than are simply instrumental (such as ruling­class or elite interest), primordial (in the sense of ingrained natural instincts), or ''constructionist\" (such as communities persuasively imagined by the new literary intelligentsia). As I have suggested before in referring to the discourse of ethnicity that has today gained the high ground as a viewing perspective, there are more than the abovementioned features at work. There are other processes—communicational, mobilizational, and semiotic—that have to be tracked to understand how and why in the context of competitive democratic electoral politics, the appeal to collective ethnic identity and entitlements, and religious, linguistic, territorial, and caste or \"racial\" legacies and attributes powerfully impels people to participate with heightened sentiments and aspirations in collective actions, which may be imbued with extreme violence. It is hoped that the following case studies of collective violence will help to convey the complex interac­ Page 26 tions and interweavings that produce ethnonationalist movements and conflicts. It is easy when faced with the damage, dislocation, violence, and disturbance of alleged \"law and order\" that occurs in ethnonational conflicts to view these conflicts in a totally negative way. I have already intimated why this is a simplistic reading: the generation of ethnonationalist and regional conflicts is intimately connected with the failure of the homogenizing and centralizing nation­state­making project, and the monopolizing of state power by a majority in an arena in which minorities and groups distinguished by multicultural differences (territorial, religious, linguistic, and \"racial\" or \"ethnic'' in the narrow sense) also coexist. The discourse of ethnicity has elevated to prominence concepts such as \"plural society,\" \"multicultural accommodation and coexistence,\" \"devolution of political and administrative powers\" to regional or ethnic collectivities, and the rights of \"self­determination\" of minorities, including those of \"resistance\" and \"secession.\" Parallel with these developments \"organic communities,\" united by common cultural legacies—language, literature, religion, and customs—have been reformulated in many parts of the world. In order to understand such social and cultural constructions of identity, and the claims related to them, we need to get beyond purely \"instrumental\" and \"utilitarian\" considerations. Finally, it is relevant to bear in mind that there is a spectrum of semantic connotations that extends beyond the gloss and valuation given the words communalism and communal in South Asia since the time of the British Raj. But in fact, as used in expressions such as \"communal sentiments,\" the word communal also carries semantically enriching associations that are collective rather than individual in scope. This sense of communal taps meanings from several cognate notions, such as \"community\" (a people living in a locality having common interests and an administrative unity); and \"commune\" in the French sense of the smallest political division (cf. also \"communalism\": the theory that the state should be a confederation of self­governing communes). No doubt we could extend this network of associations to link up with Marx's \"communism\" (minimally, a community sharing goods according to need), and even with Victor Turner's \"communitas\" (a heightened, undifferentiated, transcending, \"liminal\" feeling that participants experience in climactic phases of ritual). In a different vein, Will Kymlicka has recently argued that liberalism, \"as a political philosophy often viewed as being primarily concerned with the relationship between the individual and the state, and with limiting state intrusions on the liberties of citizens,\" can be reconciled with \"the virtues and importance of our membership in a community and culture.\" 6 Page 27 In the light of these associations and elaborations, it is wise for us in this study to keep an open mind with regard to the virtues deriving from the co­presence and interplay of communal solidarity and \"brotherhood\" and collective cultural practices and rights, on the one hand, and, on the other, conflictual, divisive, and destructive tendencies in what are called ethnic conflicts, especially in their impact on the alleged requirements and maintenance of \"nation­states\" and on the attainment of ''national integration.\" Collective Violence: Domains of Inquiry A great deal already has been written on the historical antecedents of ethnic conflicts, and on the political, religious, economic, and social circumstances in which many of them have broken out. These accounts include the effects of global processes that stem from the influence of metropolitan centers upon satellite countries, the assumptions and the problems of nation making, and the politics of ethnic and other group entitlement claims in plural societies. In contrast to this rich literature, relatively little is known about the nature of the destruction and dislocations caused by collective violence during ethnic conflicts. This study is an attempt to broach this complex issue and probe some aspects of it, while at the same time situating it in the larger aforementioned context. The phenomena of ethnic and collective violence entail at least three large domains of inquiry, which can be labeled the anthropology of collective violence, the anthropology of displaced persons, and the anthropology of suffering. The first, the anthropology of collective violence, is the study of the forms and trajectories of collective aggression, and the characteristics of the aggressors themselves as members of civilian crowds and mobs, or of professional security forces and paramilitary \"guerrilla\" or insurgent groups. The organization and dynamics of these crowds and groups, their strategies and techniques of violence, and so on, are part of this inquiry. The second, the anthropology of displaced persons, is the study of the victims of \"ethnic cleansing\" and violence as displaced persons, and as refugees who have taken to flight and have faced relocation. Their marginal existence, placement in camps, control and manipulation by authorities, asymmetrical relations with the local populace and invidious comparisons with the latter, relegation to the limbo of \"nonnationals\" if they have breached a frontier, attempts to reconstruct their own identity, and the theodicy of their suffering in mytho­historical terms—these are some of the features of the anthropology of displacement and dislocation. This Page 28 train of inquiry ultimately merges with the situation of overseas communities established as a result of diaspora and their complex attitudes and relations with their kin at home and their hosts abroad. The third, the anthropology of suffering, is the study of the experiences and sufferings and coping patterns of the victims and survivors: the trials of suffering torture and witnessing the brutal deaths of husbands, sons, kinsmen, and friends; the traumas of women who have been made widows, of women raped, degraded, and humiliated; the inability of survivors to conduct normal mortuary rites and grieving for their dead; and the loss of homes and property and businesses. These ordeals and the means of coping with them at individual, family, community and collective levels, as well as the social and psychic costs that deter or defeat restoration and rehabilitation—these are some of the features of the anthropology of suffering. The phenomena of collective violence, of displacement and dislocation, and of the suffering of survivors are linked, and any ample study of ethnic conflict must address them. Crowds and Riots This study is limited to only a part of the first domain of collective violence outlined above. It focuses primarily on the phenomenon of civilian riots, the most frequent and dramatic expression of ethnic conflict; it is only marginally concerned with those states and forms of ethnic conflict that have developed into a condition of civil war in which professional armed security forces of the state are engaged in clashes with armed oppositional guerrilla movements and insurgency groups, who in turn, in a triangular contest, may be at war with one another. This radical state of civil war and insurgency is frequently the end process preceded by episodic civilian riots of the kind focused upon in this book. Although a main submission of the book is its complexity, multidimensionality, and embeddedness in larger contexts, the phenomenon of \"riots\" enacted by \"civilian crowds\" needs to be defined briefly here. It is difficult to mark off \"riots\" as one particular kind of collective violence, distinct from such outbursts as \"rebellions,\" \"insurrections,'' and \"millenarian movements.\" If, by the term riots, we understand collectivities of people, or \"crowds,\" engaging in violent acts such as arson, destruction of property, and physical injury to human beings (including extreme acts of homicide and rape), directed against a designated enemy, whether it be a social group or category or the state or political administration (or a combination of them), then rebellions, insurrections, millenarian movements, peasant Page 29 wars, political strikes, and so forth, may go through a phase or contain incidents and encounters that have the features of \"riots.\" It is also true that the word riots may have tendentious conservative, illiberal, and authoritarian connotations, and may be the opprobrious label pinned by political authorities, the security forces of the state, or the upper classes and landed aristocracy onto the collective mobilization and political protests and resistance mounted by the so­called lower orders: workers, peasants, lumpenproletariat, and \"criminal classes.\" In such contexts of evaluation and rhetorical use, the crowds are also described as \"mobs,\" implying that the participants are irrational, out of control, out to burn and loot, and therefore deserving of forcible repressive action by the police, the army, and gentlemen vigilantes. There is a genre of writing on popular movements in Western Europe by scholars such as George Rudé, E.P. Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm, Natalie Zemon Davis, Charles Tilly, and others that has commented on these associations and their implications. Yet these authors have also continued to employ the word riots in a neutral way to designate the collective violence of crowds, whether it occurs in revolutions, rebellions, religious wars, or other occasions of public disturbance. In the same way, I also neutrally call the phenomenon of collective violence during ethnic conflict \"riots.\" In recent years, a genre of historical studies influenced in part by literature of the aforementioned kind, and self­labeled \"subaltern studies,\" has tried to describe and interpret various collective actions and movements on the part of Indian peasantry and urban populations during the British Raj. A leading exponent of the subaltern perspective, Ranajit Guha, characterizes official British accounts of these events as dressed up in \"the prose of counterinsurgency.\" Attempts are now being made to write Indian history as a saga of the struggle between the subaltern classes and the elite, and the Indian masses and the British imperial rule. Writing on \"the colonial construction of 'communalism,'\" Gyanendra Pandey, for example, charges that British administrators reduced a variety of protest movements to the single master principle of an enduring communal divide between Muslims and Hindus and justified the use of deadly force to suppress them by defining them as \"riots'' threatening law and order. 7 Well taken though these points may be, the collective ethnic violence on which this book focuses has, except for the 1915 riots in colonial Ceylon, occurred in postindependence India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. The label riots is currently widely used in these countries to designate certain kinds of collective crowd action, and witnesses and sources of many kinds have indeed documented acts of violence in the form of arson, loot­ Page 30 ing, and physical injury. But while the master concepts of \"counterinsurgency\" and \"resistance\" may be powerful readings of colonial history vis­à­vis the alien and exploitative British Raj and its indigenous \"collaborators,\" the same postulates cannot so easily and unproblematically be applied when the aggressors can be shown not solely to be the government or the ruling classes—although these have been integrally implicated in such \"ethnic\" riots—and where the colliding entities comprise a spectrum of social categories, ranging from the educated and affluent to a majority of ordinary, poorer folk. Riots as Contingent and Recurring Phenomena Is there any sense in drawing a distinction between local religious/sectarian or even caste conflicts that in the main entail small groups, mobilized on the basis of patron­ client ties, acting in pursuance of disputes over sumptuary privileges and ritual precedence, on the one hand, and \"communal conflicts\" involving larger ethnic collectivities perceived as united by, among other things, religious affiliation, mother tongue, homeland, and economic specialization, on the other? More specifically, has this second order of communal conflicts expanded and become more ubiquitous and intense at a time when new nation­states are attempting to order their political lives in terms of participatory democracy and their economic lives according to varying mixes of socialist welfare and capitalist market­oriented canons? A further question, closely linked to the preceding one, is whether these clashes and explosions of violence are an expression of deep­seated, primordial cleavages based on tendentious historical memories and mythologies and reinforced by economic disparities and political rivalries. Are riots eruptions that occur repeatedly along such hoary fault lines? Or are they better seen in more dynamic terms, not as recurring manifestations of bounded and crystallized identities, but as the responses of collectivities whose mobilization and membership are partly at least contingent on social, economic, and political circumstances and calculations? The boundaries and intensities of communal solidarity and identity change along with the larger political and economic map, and political, economic, and social advantage and privilege underlie the eruption and subsidence of communal riots in modern South Asia in response to revivalist and reformist religious, cultural, and ethnic stimuli. Such riots are episodic, recurring events, which may occur after long periods of co­existence, between ethnic communities who have shared many understandings and Page 31 conventions, have frequently taken part in one another's cults and attended one another's shrines, and have syncretically borrowed practices from one another. Why, then, are \"ethnic\" formations, however temporary and variable, effective for religious, political, and economic competition and conflict in post­colonial nation­ states? A heightened politicization of ethnicity and simultaneously an ethnification of politics are marked features of our time, and the power of this discourse invites extensive study, as ideology, as verbal performance, as performative action, and as practice with pragmatic outcomes. The Collective Standpoint It is clear that many of the communal conflicts that this work focuses on, conflicts engaging large collectivities of people, exploding into violence, and in turn structured by strategies and techniques of violence, are intimately related to the issues of late colonialism and of postindependence times. Whatever their retrospective justifications and rootedness in history, these conflicts relate to present interests and objectives—such as those stemming from representative democracy, mass politics, the distributive policies of the welfare state, world economic processes, the capacities and use of old and new media of communication for mobilization of people, and the divisive interests of groups in plural societies. So to my way of thinking, no doubt at the risk of simplifying and narrowing my approach, it is important at this stage of my study probing collective violence to go so far as is possible in systematically sketching the collective, interpersonal, and communicative dimensions of ethnic conflict, and not to attempt systematically to integrate those processes with the actors' individual genetic, physical, mental, and affective capacities. The latter task is beyond me and outside my ken in any case. The imperatives and justification for a collective, interpersonal perspective as a coherent exercise are provided by these diagnostic manifestations: 1. In the later stages of colonialism and the postindependence era, the search for collective identity—whether national, subnational, ethnic, or regional—has been conducted with a sense of urgency. Frequently, the impulse to define and enact a collective identity based in \"traditional\" religion, language, culture, and homelands is fused with a sense of resistance to the alleged hegemonic march of Western power, which especially in the form of colonial rule has inferiorized peoples who have not attained to its technological and material level, and denigrated their religions and cultural attainments. Page 32 2. The people at large have frequently pressed their claims to rights, privileges, and benefits in terms of the argument of collective entitlements (not in terms of individual rights). 3. Frequently, the search for religious salvation and congregational solidarity is pursued through participation in public ritual that seeks salvation for the collectivity. The rise (or resurgence) of religious fundamentalism and millennial and bhakti (devotional) movements is evidence of the collective character of the salvation search. 4. Insurrections, riots, and elections are all actions by collectivities of people mobilized for public action. In a larger sense, we are dealing with the activities and interactions of people in public arenas—assembled for large­scale ceremonies, for mass politics, for purposes of protest and punitive actions in public places and sites, such as main thoroughfares, city centers and plazas, nodes of transportation, schools and colleges, and so on. 5. Finally, viewed as both contingent and recurring volcanic, even demonizing, hostilities, ethnic riots need to be scrutinized and closely examined as collective events, constituted of certain discernible components drawn from a cultural repertoire and public culture, and combined into sequences that form the trajectory and phases of the riots. Some of the components of this repertoire may well be drawn from the forms of everyday ritualized life, and from the ritual calendar of festivities. They may be imitated, or inverted, or parodied, according to their dramatic and communicative possibilities. 6. An entirely different question remains even when all this has been taken into account: Are crowds driven in certain respects by energies, imperatives, and interpersonal communicative processes special to their existence as temporary, volatile, active \"masses\"? Here we enter the domain of what has been called \"mass psychology,\" the \"psychology of crowds,\" and \"political psychology,\" and it is my view that although we must begin with and exhaust the historical specificities, contextual particulars, and organized purposive features of certain riot episodes in the form of case studies, we must also subsequently ask more general and comparative questions about the constitution and movement of rioting crowds that seem general to these case studies insofar as they exhibit tendencies, patterns, and processes that are shared. The Layout of the Study This volume was conceived as a diptych. The first part consists of some case studies, which attempt to be detailed and rounded documentations, giving Page 33 full weight to historical developments and to the political, economic, social, and religious contexts in which certain episodes of collective violence, chiefly in the form of civilian riots, have occurred. They also give details of the riots themselves—their duration, their phases, the identity of the participants (the faces in the crowd) and the victims, the nature of the violence and destruction, the extent to which there is evidence of planning and direction by interested parties, and the actions of the security forces of the state. The illustrations are taken from Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan, and the documentation and discussion of these issues in \"narrative form\" are guided by certain patterns and processes that are up to a point shared. The second part, which is based on the first, attempts to delineate some comparative points that emerge from the case studies, further supplemented by other examples, notably the dispute over the Babri mosque in Ayodhya by Hindu nationalists and the aftermath of riots in Bombay and elsewhere, and to state some issues and processes of general relevance to situations of collective violence and crowd actions. It is hoped that the convergent patterns established and the comparative and theoretical discussions deriving from them may have general relevance to the multitude of ethnic, ethnonational, and communal conflicts occurring in many parts of the globe today, and not simply to South Asia. My analysis is based on both original and secondary sources, including the writings of many scholars, government records, the reports of official and unofficial commissions of inquiry, newspaper columns and magazine articles, and personal research. All these in one form or another constitute narratives, which have been arranged and structured according to categories and in formats consciously or unconsciously employed by the authors. For me as author, all these sources comprise a body of archival references and information, which I have used to construct, not so much a single unifying metanarrative, but a number of middle­range narratives according to certain categories I have chosen. Where there are general patterns and processes that these narratives share, I have drawn attention to them by intertextual cross­referencing, and even taken the risk of interpreting them by conceptual theorizing. Both deductive and inductive processes are necessarily dialectically deployed. I have felt throughout my labors as author that I was not so much an outsider as a participant observer attempting to order and arrange the archival information at hand so as to foreground repetitive features as well as differences and inconsistencies. My exposure to ethnic conflict began when as a person of Sri Lankan origins and with experience of life in that Page 34 country, the riots of 1983 there touched and involved me personally so directly and intensely that as an insider as well as an anthropologist, I felt entitled and indeed compelled to write my version and to make evaluations and proposals, because the people and events I was \"representing\" were not differently \"the other\" but intimately my own. Simultaneously, I could accept that my \"voice,\" or representation, was one among other possible \"voices\" and representations, although they too, insofar as they narrated events that happened, had to refer to a body of archival references and to reported ''evidence\" that could be tested, challenged, or confirmed according to shared verification criteria. Thus, provided they agree on certain rules of relevance, selection, and confirmation of information cited, a community of scholars can make preferential evaluations among multiple representations or narratives of the 1983 Sri Lankan riots. I have at the next widening circle of experience and knowledge, a strong sense of being a South Asian: centered as a Sri Lankan, I have cathected a strong identity with and possess a fair knowledge of many things and persons in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, an identity that also recognizes preferences, appreciations, dislikes, and critical attitudes. I have approached and treated the various kinds of information concerning events in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh that were available to me with the expectation of being able to construct coherent narratives that relate to and can be tested against the evidence (even if that evidence is not always factual in some unrealistically neutral or objective sense). No doubt other South Asianists will have the opportunity to pass judgments on the plausibility of my accounts, and their assessments are necessarily an important test. Aside from being a Sri Lankan and a South Asian, and carrying many other co­existent and situationally arousable identities, I am also an anthropologist, professionally trained in the West, who has interacted for many years with colleagues and students of primarily, but by no means exclusively, Western origin. By experience and knowledge and long residence, I also necessarily participate, but in a selective manner, in Western civilization. As author, I am not only writing in English but also know that I am principally addressing my professional colleagues, fellow academics, and, more widely, certain segments of the reading public in the West and East. I would, however, stoutly resist any suggestion that my accounts in this book are structured by preconceived Western categories of thought contaminated by valuations and perceptions grounded in an allegedly myopic Western milieu. On the contrary, my writings first relate to events witnessed and described, or reported by various sources in \"experience near\" Page 35 terms, and they have been attuned to the actors' ways of seeing, hearing, and experiencing events. But they also had to cope with sources of a more tendentious kind. Like every other author, I have exercised my own critical skills in selecting, evaluating, and developing my narratives, which try to \"translate\" my selections and inferences into a language of representation my readers can understand and, I hope, appreciate. Page 36 3 The 1915 Sinhala Buddhist­Muslim Riots in Ceylon The episodes that triggered the 1915 riots in colonial Ceylon resemble the perennial sources of strife between Hindus and Muslims in India. The tensions started in Gampola, once the capital of a medieval Sinhalese kingdom. There, as in many other towns, Buddhists lived in close proximity to Muslims, who had hitherto made no objections to the peraheras (processions) that the Buddhists staged annually at Wesak (the Buddha's birthday and day of enlightenment), during Esala (the month of July­August), and on other occasions. But things changed after a new mosque was built on Ambagamuwa Street in 1907 by newly arrived \"Coast Moors\" from India, whom the Sinhalese called \"Hambankaraya.\" 1 The Moors' leaders objected to the Buddhist Esala peraheras that had always passed that way with beating of drums and pipe music. \"The Basnayake Nilame (Lay Officer) of the Walahagoda Dewala (temple), from which the procession was organized, pointed out that the route was a 'via sacra' laid out by ancient custom and, he believed, guaranteed by the Kandyan Convention of 1815,\" Charles Blackton notes. \"Each successive year after 1907, however, the Coast Moors registered their protest, with the result that, in 1909, a police decision rerouted the procession in spite of the pleas of the Basnayake Nilame. When this annual argument recurred in 1911, the government agent agreed to a return to the traditional route, provided that the Buddhists' music and drumming cease fifty yards on either side of the Coast Moormen's mosque.\"2 When a newly appointed basnayake nilame applied for a procession license in 1912, the government agent issued it on condition that the prohibition on music be in force whenever the procession moved past the Coast Moors' mosque and all other places of worship. Charging that the govern­ Page 37 ment had deprived them and the Dewala of their rights, the basnayake nilame, backed by the temple servants and tenants, instituted a suit in the district court in Kandy against the attorney general of the colony, ultimately winning a favorable decision from Judge Paul E. Pieris in 1914. \"The attorney general of Ceylon appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Ceylon, where, on February 2, 1915, Judge Pieris's decision was reversed by Justices Shaw and de Sampayo. This decision caused wide dissatisfaction among Buddhists in Ceylon. The case was then appealed further, by Gampola Buddhists, to the Privy Council in London ... but the frustration evoked by the Supreme Court decision was felt most intensely in the up­country provinces where the Kandyan Convention of 1815 was particularly relevant.\" 3 The Buddhist plaintiff in the Gampola perahera case based his right on the fifth provision of the Kandyan Convention of 1815, which was described by his solicitors as a \"solemn treaty of cession between the British Crown and the Kandyan Sinhalese which could not be varied by subsequent legislation.\" The centenary of the convention fell in 1915, and several prominent Sinhalese Buddhist activists, politicians, and even highly placed Sri Lankan officials who were loyal to the Crown—such as District Judge Paul E. Pieris, whose judgment on behalf of the Buddhist plaintiff had been reversed by the Supreme Court—and Sinhalese Christian clergymen, such as the Reverend J. Simon De Silva, had participated in the organization of the National Day Movement to commemorate that historic moment, which no doubt was shot through with both pride and ambivalence. On the one hand, the Sinhalese saw in it the passing away of their last kingdom, which had withstood the colonial powers for quite some time and had subsequently been romanticized; on the other hand, although the British had become the overlords, they had signed a treaty in which they undertook to protect and respect the religion and customs of the people. Despite the name of the National Day Movement, it did not sport anti­colonial sentiments or harbor a \"conspiracy\" against the Raj. However, it should not escape attention that many Buddhists did view the Coast Moors' objections to their processions as flouting their traditional rights and customs. And it is not fortuitous that a month after the Supreme Court's adverse judgment, on March 2, 1915, the supposed centenary of the fall of the Kandyan kingdom, the newspaper Dinamina published a special issue with reproductions of the Lion Flag and photographs of the last king, Sri Wickrama Rajasinha, and one of his queens. Indeed, it must have come as a puncturing of Buddhist expectations when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in confirming the judg­ Page 38 ment of the Supreme Court, incorporated this passage from the submission of the Coast Moor respondents' solicitors: We would point out that after the rebellion of 1818 a proclamation was issued in November of that year, and from that date down to the present time the government of the island has always been administered upon the footing that all persons inhabiting the island should have full liberty of conscience, and the free exercise of all such modes of religious worship as were not prohibited by law, provided they be contented with the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the same, not giving offense or scandal to the government. The Privy Council went on to affirm that the administration of laws \"must be regarded as liable to such changes by competent authority as in process of time and under changing circumstances the general interests of the colony or the interests of law and order may demand.\" In practice, what the imperial power was telling its Ceylonese colonial subjects was that it alone had the right and power to administer the country, unfettered by any alleged treaty, and according to its own judgment of what was in the \"interests\" of the colony. The colonial authorities showed what they meant by their sole right to judge the interests of the colony when they overreacted to the riots of 1915 by letting the armed forces and the police incarcerate and kill many persons in the belief that the riots constituted a conspiracy to terminate British rule. The Rise of Sinhalese Buddhist Revivalism and Nationalism During the nineteenth century, especially in its second half, in colonial Ceylon, there were revivalist and reformist developments in Buddhism, the religion of the majority of the Sinhalese (who themselves were and are the majority \"ethnic\" category in the island); in Hinduism, the religion of the majority of Tamils; and in Islam, the religion of the Coast Moors. To a significant degree these developments were reactions to the proselytizing and propagandist thrust of the Christian missions, which also enjoyed a virtual monopoly of education, especially through the English and Anglo­vernacular schools, which produced the so­called English­speaking elite, the majority of whom were native Christians. Christian missions enjoying colonial favored treatment also denigrated the beliefs and religious practices of the Buddhists and Hindus as superstitious, inferior, and conservative. These religious movements, especially those that stirred within Buddhism and Hinduism, and that are respectively associated with famous charismatic and innovative leaders such as Anagarika Dharmapala (1864–1933) and Aru­ Page 39 muga Navalar, have hitherto been labeled religious \"revivalism,\" religious \"reformism,\" religious \"modernism,\" \"Protestant Buddhism,\" and so on. Their Islamic revivalist counterpart occurred later, toward the end of the century. Significantly, these three reactions in Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam were (and are still today) intimately and exclusively linked to different \"communities,\" now described as ethnic groups—the Sinhalese, the Tamils, and Muslims/Moors. The minorities among the Sinhalese and Tamils who had become Christians were the targets of the revivalists. The three revivalist movements were united in their antagonism to the Christian missions, but at the same time, they borrowed features from them. In another respect—and this is crucial to the theme of the relation between religious revivalism and militancy and violence—they also heightened, made self­ conscious, and deepened the communal and ethnic consciousness, solidarity, and exclusiveness of the three \"ethnic­religious\" communities. (In the case of the Sinhalese and Tamils, language added another dimension to their separateness; the Muslims were Tamil­speaking or bilingual.) These developments thus also confirm the general tendency of revivalist (and fundamentalist) movements to become exclusive and separatist, rather than ecumenical and coalescing. In the case I am describing, the three revivalisms became \"oppositional\" in a dual sense: they were openly oppositional to the Christian denominations, as the latter were to them; and they were open to the possibility of becoming oppositional among themselves if their interests and objectives collided. (Thus Sinhala Buddhists and Sinhala Roman Catholics clashed in 1883; Sinhala Buddhists and Muslims collided in 1915; and in the postindependence years, especially from 1956 on, the Sinhala and Tamils have been ethnic antagonists.) Of all the revivalist developments in Sri Lanka in the latter half of the nineteenth century and since, the most complex, weighty, powerful, and fateful for the historical trajectory of the country has been Sinhala Buddhist revivalism (up to a point usefully labeled \"Protestant Buddhism\" by Gananath Obeyesekere). This had its start first among certain educated and anti­Christian preacher monks such as Migettuwatte Gunananda (incumbent of Dipaduttama Vihara at Kotahena) and H. Sumangala (principal of Vidyodaya Pirivena), was then stimulated and given organizational muscle and propagandistic efficacy by the Theosophists, notably Colonel H. S. Olcott and Mme. H.P. Blavatsky, and culminated with the efforts of their protégé Anagarika Dharmapala, a charismatic reformer who extended its reach and intensity to new levels. 4 The revivalism associated with Dharmapala as its exemplar was a prod­ Page 40 uct directly of the encounter with missionary Christianity and secondarily with British colonialism, which provided a protective umbrella for the Christian missions and simultaneously \"disestablished\" the Buddhist religion and Sangha (order of Buddhist monks), which had enjoyed the protection and patronage of the native Kandyan kingdom conquered by the British in 1815. Buddhist revivalism incorporated some of the Christian (principally Protestant) missions' values, attitudes, and techniques; it was at once an \"imitation\" and a \"repudiation.\" On the one hand, there was the selective retrieval of some aspects of the philosophical constructs of early Buddhism, as embodied in the sutta discourses, and monastic discipline, as set out in the vinaya pitaka; on the other, there was a denigration, rejection, and excision of \"heathen\" elements (seen through missionary eyes), polytheistic ''excesses,\" superstitious ritual practices, and magical manipulations. The need to reform from within has been characterized as a \"Protestant\" reaction. And the counterattack of Buddhist proselytization consisted of the successful borrowing and deployment of Western and Christian techniques and institutional forms: the printing press, organizations (e.g., the Young Men's Buddhist Association, or YMBA), schools to teach English as well as Buddhism, public debates, and so on. Buddhist activism critically influenced a constituency consisting of an emergent urban \"middle class\" (traders, small entrepreneurs, lawyers, lower echelons of the administration) and a village \"elite\" (vernacular school teachers, registrars and notaries public, native physicians, headmen) that differentiated itself from the rural peasantry. And this constituency was principally the spearhead and carrier of two trends: affirmation of a Sinhala Buddhist \"identity\" (Obeyesekere) and generation of what might be called a \"self­respect\" movement—self­upliftment in the face of colonial domination and denigration. As Sarath Amunugama has emphasized, Dharmapala was much taken with propounding a code of lay ethics, paralleling the behavior code for Buddhist monks (vinaya) propounded in early Buddhism. In evaluating this preoccupation and its significance, it is useful to note that revivalist (and fundamentalist) streams are generally antipermissive and are intolerant of moral relativism or relaxation of standards of conduct. Dharmapala's Daily Code for the Laity, a manual setting out two hundred rules for lay Buddhist conduct, reflected Western norms of cleanliness, politeness, and etiquette, on the one hand, and the orthodox behavior traditionally expected of genteel wives, benevolent masters, and acquiescent servants and employees, on the other. It was also preoccupied with a \"puritanical\" attitude to sexuality and modesty in family life. 5 In assessing the reformism spearheaded by Dharmapala, it would be an Page 41 exaggeration, I think, to view it as responsible for any significant \"social reform,\" outside of the strictures and norms imposed on lay sexuality and on Sinhalese \"bourgeois\" family conduct. Buddhist revivalism in colonial Ceylon was not marked by a desire for deep social and economic reform. It did not seek to change the established caste discrimination and dominance; to build enduring political organizations; or to motivate people to address themselves seriously to transforming landlord­tenant relations in peasant agriculture and to play an active entrepreneurial role in establishing large­scale capitalist business enterprises. Its organization took the form of multicentric \"temperance societies\" and local associations, and its rhetorical exhortations to young Sri Lankans urged them, for example, to \"learn industries, learn weaving, learn arts and crafts, learn agriculture, learn medical sciences. . . . To be independent we must produce our rice, our own clothes, our own building materials, our own medicines and then will come independence.'' A pamphlet published in Calcutta in 1922 gives the reader a sense of the range of issues that Dharmapala never tired of repeating in distinctly hectoring rhetoric: it contains advice \"to ransack the literature of the science of patriotism \\[so as\\] to learn to act as patriots for the preservation of our nation\"; it exudes sentimental romanticization of the past, extolling in particular the exemplary hero of the Mahavamsa, the righteous Dutthagamani, who \"reinvigorated and revitalized the nation\"; it fulminates against the British, who \"for the sake of filthy lucre opened liquor shops in Ceylon\"; it attacks the \"Tamils, Cochins, \\[and\\] Hambankarayas \\[who\\] are employed in large numbers to the prejudice of the people of the Island—sons of the soil, who contribute the largest share\"; and at the same time, it exhorts young men to seek scientific and professional education in the United States, Japan, Germany, England, and elsewhere abroad. There is no indication of how these young men, who were to be patriotic and imbued with a sense of the past, as well as with reformed Buddhism, were at the same time creatively to incorporate and adapt to science and technology. Dharmapala was more a propagandist than a creative or profound thinker­reformer. 6 A problematic reading of the movement emerges when Dharmapala's ethic is christened \"this­worldly\" asceticism.7 As an ethic of action justifiable within Buddhism, it simply did not catch on. Dharmapala's role as anagarika (a homeless layman who has taken a vow of celibacy and is dedicated to active work on behalf of the Buddhist religion) was not imitated by Sinhalese Buddhists, save for a couple of his associates. Aside from the founding of Buddhist schools and printing activities, which provided avenues of occupational and social advancement and enhanced the sense of Page 42 identity and self­respect of the rising Sinhalese middle class, the main energies of Buddhist revivalism flowed, not into an active transformation of this world socially, economically, and politically (which is what Max Weber saw as entailed in Protestant Christianity's inner­worldly asceticism), but into quite another project, namely, the promotion of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism and an accompanying critique of the misdeeds of British colonial rule. The phrase used by Richard Gombrich and Obeyesekere, \"this­worldly asceticism,\" although no doubt consciously meant to distinguish it from Max Weber's formulation vis­à­vis the Protestant ethic, nevertheless poses the question of just what lay ascetic actions of a this­worldly kind might simultaneously be meaningful and relate to the Buddhist goal of liberation from this world. It is relevant to note that a substantial number of the emergent Buddhist petite bourgeoisie, traders, and middle class had already emerged by the 1880s, and that Dharmapala himself rose from this seedbed rather than stimulating its formation through his advocacy. This social category no doubt expanded at the turn of the century, endowed temples, observed lay religiosity on poya days and at other marked times, and participated in some good causes, such as temperance campaigns. The limits and appropriateness of the label \"Protestant Buddhism\" are more relevantly considered elsewhere. 8 A central submission made here is that the marriage of revivalist Buddhism and militant Sinhalese nationalism emerged in the late nineteenth century primarily as a reaction to and legacy of the colonial era.9 Body will be given later to the judgment that Dharmapala's modern Buddhism was a moralistic and nationalist ideology, mainly a protest (rather than Protestant) Buddhism, appropriate for an educated and increasingly urbanized population: for a middle class of aspiring administrators, clerks, teachers, and professionals; for a village elite of vernacular teachers, ayurvedic physicians, and Buddhist monks; for small entrepreneurs and businessmen (mudalalis) competing with rivals belonging to other communities; and ultimately even for an urban working class recently come from villages. All these categories of population brought into the fold of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism were by the very nature of the colonial and postcolonial economy focused on the filling of state­generated and ­financed administrative and professional positions and on the capture of the bounty of the state, the chief controller of resources and distributor of subsidies, rewards, and licenses. Buddhist revivalism fueling Sinhala Buddhist nationalism and majoritarian domination thus in its final thrust became a means of hegemonic capture and exercise of power and wealth, an exclusivist position that promised monopolistic gains to the majority. Wherever local Page 43 business sprouted, there too the patronage of the state for subsidies, protection, access to resources, and fending off of rivals has been vital. The patronage of politicians and the patron­client networks of mudalalis are involved in a reciprocal exchange of benefits. It could be argued with the benefit of hindsight that the role of the Buddhist schools, the Mahabodhi Journal, the YMBA, and the Buddhist press was not so much the implementation of social reform as the forging of an ideology and consciousness of nationalist identity, destiny, and majoritarian privilege. Treating Sinhala Buddhist revivalism and nationalism as a reaction to British colonial domination and its preferential and discriminatory policies is seeing only one half of the picture. The other half—dialectically and dynamically related to the former, and especially deriving from colonial economic ventures, setting up of administrative and judicial frameworks, and spreading of literacy and education—consists of the processes of internal social and economic differentiation and invidious competition, and of elite formation and \"class\" fragmentation, among the native peoples. To this were added the rivalries under colonial administration of ethnic communities that found solidarity in religious revival, mytho­historical identity formation, and strategies of collaboration with the British Raj, which in turn had a practiced imperial eye for the costs and benefits of a policy of divide and rule. In 1915, Sinhala Buddhist revivalism and nationalism came into violent collision with the evolving Islamic consciousness and identity especially of the Coast Moors, whose economic activities and acquisitiveness ran counter to the economic interests of some Sinhala Buddhist \"low­country\" businessmen and the alleged consumer interests of the Sinhalese public. This episode is attractive as a case study both because it has been more researched and written about than any other subsequent communal or ethnic riot and because it can be placed within the larger political, religious, and economic context, impulsions, and trends of that time. A close look at the details of the episode—the participants in the riots, the creation of public opinion, the course of the riots, the nature of punitive actions—also will permit us to see those features of the collective violence itself that cannot be seen as flowing inevitably and solely from Sinhala Buddhist or Muslim religious propensities as such. Demographic Distributions According to the Census of 1911, out of a total population of 4,106,350, the Sinhalese comprised 66.10 percent (24.30 percent Kandyans and 41.80 per­ Page 44 Table 1 Population of Colonial Ceylon, 1911 Province Population Percentage of Total Western 1,106,321 26.94 Central 672,258 16.37 Southern 628,817 15.31 Northwestern 434,116 10.58 Sabaragamuwa 408,521 9.95 Northern 369,651 9.00 Uva 216,692 5.28 Eastern 183,698 4.47 North Central 86,276 2.10 Total 4,106,350 SOURCE: E.

Denham, The Census of Ceylon, 1911 (Colombo: Government Printer, 1912). cent low­country Sinhalese), 25.70 percent were Tamils (half of whom were Indian immigrants and plantation laborers), and 6.50 percent were Muslims or Moors, of whom one in seven were Indian Coast Moors. The remainder included Burghers (the descendants of Dutch settlers), British, and Malays, who although also Muslim were a separate census category. Colonial Ceylon was administratively divided into nine provinces, whose populations are shown in table 1. It is noteworthy that the five provinces implicated in the 1915 riots—Western, Central, Southern, Northwestern, and Sabaragamuwa—were also demographically the five largest provinces in the island, containing 78.9 percent of the total population. The Western Province, which had the largest proportion of the population (26.9 percent), also contained the island's only large city: Colombo, the island's capital, with 211,274 people. Jaffna (40,441 inhabitants, mainly Tamil), located in the Northern Province, was the next largest town, followed by Galle (39,960), and Kandy (29,927), the capitals of the Southern and Central provinces. There were also numerous smaller towns, administrative, marketing and educational centers, such as Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampola, Matale, Negombo, Ratnapura, Chilaw, virtually all of them located in the five most populous provinces listed above. Religious Distribution In 1911, 60 percent of the population of Ceylon were Buddhist, 23 percent Hindu, 10 percent Christian, and 6.5 percent Muslim. Of the Sinhalese Page 45 population, about 91 percent were Buddhist and about 9 percent Christian. The majority of the Tamils, 87.6 percent, were Hindu, while about 12 percent were Christian. All Sinhalese were either Buddhist or Christian, virtually all Tamils were Hindu or Christian, and virtually all Moors and Malays were Muslim. The island's Muslims spoke Tamil as their mother tongue and shared certain customs with Tamils on the subcontinent. The proportions of Sinhalese who were Buddhist and Christian in selected provinces is relevant to the issue of Buddhist revivalism and anti­Christian sentiment. For example, in the Western and Northwestern provinces, about 18 percent and 17 percent of Sinhalese declared themselves to be Christian, and 82 percent and 83 percent said they were Buddhist. In strong contrast, about 98 percent or more of Sinhalese in the Sinhalese­dominated Southern, Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, and North Central provinces were Buddhist. In Colombo Municipality, the proportions identified with different religions show a quite extraordinary mix: Buddhists there comprised 31 percent, Christians 28 percent, Muslims 22 percent, and Hindus 19 percent. The capital city is thus an interesting arena for following the relationships between the religious communities. However, in Colombo District, outside of the municipality, the two largest religious groups were Buddhists, 74 percent, and Christians, 21.4 percent. The Christians, although comprising only 10 percent of the population, were unevenly distributed in the country. The highest proportion of Christians—mostly Catholics—was found in the Chilaw and Mannar districts, where virtually half the population was Christian. Christians came second in numbers in Colombo, Jaffna, Puttalam, and Kurunegala districts, however. The lowest proportion of Christians was to be found in the deep south, especially in the Hambantota district. More than 17 percent of the Sinhalese population of the Western and Northwestern provinces were Christians. The denominational distribution of the Christians in 1911 was as follows: 83 percent were Roman Catholic, 10 percent Church of England, and 4.23 percent Wesleyan (Methodist), while Presbyterians, Baptists, Congregationalists, and other denominations amounted to less than 1 percent each. Communicants of the Church of England, who numbered about 41,000, were most numerous in the Western and Central provinces, and they also had a presence in the Southern Province. The Wesleyans, numbering about 17,000, also had their largest representation in the Western Province. The Wesleyan Methodist Mission began its work in 1814, the American Missionary Board was established in Jaffna in 1816, and the first missionaries of the Church Missionary Society (Church of England) ar­ Page 46 rived in 1818. All the Christian missions concentrated their energies on founding schools, and all the principal towns, Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Jaffna, and Matara, had famous schools that taught in the English language. The principal Roman Catholic missions in Ceylon managed 711 schools in 1911, with some 60,000 pupils. The Muslims The census of 1911 calls adherents of Islam \"Muhammadans,\" but following modern usage they are referred to here as Muslims. The census also distinguishes among Muslims by the allegedly \"racial\" labels \"Moors\" and ''Malays,\" and it further subdivides the Moors into \"Ceylon Moors\" and \"Indian or Coast Moors,\" a distribution that plays an important role in the story that follows. The census figure for all Muslims in 1911 was 283,631, a minority of 6.5 percent of the total population. The largest concentration of Muslims was in the Eastern Province, where they made up nearly 39 percent of the population and lived chiefly in the Batticaloa district. Another concentration was located in the Puttalam district of the Northwestern Province. Neither of these Muslim groups figured in the 1915 riots. It is noteworthy from the perspective of the discussion to follow that the Moors as a category constituted 21 percent of the Galle Municipality, and 18 percent and 17 percent respectively of the Colombo and Kandy municipalities. Muslims were also found dispersed throughout the rest of the island, and they constituted the second­ largest religious group in six districts—Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Anuradhapura, Mannar, and Batticaloa. There was apparently an uncomplimentary proverb among the Sinhalese and Tamils that in translation said: \"There is no place where the Moorman and the crow cannot be found.\" Let us now probe the implications of the distinction made at that time between \"Ceylon Moors\" and \"Indian or Coast Moors.\" The former were by far the larger category, making up a total of 233,901. The latter, while numbering only 32,724, had certain conspicuous and distinctive features. They had in the main arrived \"from the Coromandel Coast or inner districts of South India as traders or laborers, \\[and maintained\\] relations of amity and intermarriage with their friends in South India.\" Permanent residents among them called themselves \"Sonahar as distinguished from the Sammankarar or non­resident population from India.\" 10 The census report notes: \"The Indian Moors are found in the largest numbers in those parts of the Island where their business in Ceylon would naturally take Page 47 them. There were over 16,000 in the Western Province, of whom nearly 14,000 were enumerated in the Colombo Municipality. There were over 8,000 in the Central Province, where they are largely engaged in trade as shopkeepers, jewelers, and 'curio' sellers in the town of Kandy and as rice contractors and traders in the planting districts. There were nearly 3,000 in the Northwestern Province and 1,800 in the Province of Sabaragamuwa, where they do a considerable gemming business.\" 11 Buddhist Reactions to Christianity The 1915 riots were preceded by lesser clashes between Buddhists and Christians, the most significant of which was the Kotahena riot of 1883. These incidents disclose some of the motivations and preoccupations of the Buddhist movement. As has been noted, the Buddhist revivalists borrowed propaganda techniques, institutional forms, and the uses of the printing press from the Protestant missionaries. One well­known episode was the famous two­day debate held in Panadura, a town south of Colombo, in 1873, between the Buddhist monk Migettuwatte Gunananda, of whom we shall hear more, and the Reverend David de Silva, a Methodist, on the relative merits of their respective religions. (Local enthusiasts gave the victory to the monk.) As early as 1862, Gunananda had formed the Society for the Propagation of Buddhism as a counterweight to the Christian missions. It was during the rising tide of Buddhist reaction to Christianity that Colonel Olcott arrived in Ceylon on his first visit in 1880, and he soon afterwards founded the Buddhist Theosophical Society with the aid of Mme. Blavatsky. The stimulus given by the Theosophists to Ceylon's Buddhist revival, and the emergence of Anagarika Dharmapala under their patronage and tutelage, has been well documented elsewhere. Here the concern is to document the implications and consequences of the anti­ Christian reaction insofar as violent encounters and riots resulted. There is no doubt that a local Christian elite—educated in English, the first among the natives to enter the professions and administrative service, and to undertake entrepreneurial activities such as starting coconut and coffee plantations—dominated the political and social life of the country.12 As Kumari Jayawardena puts it: The economic, political and social advantages held by Christians were especially resented by the newly­emergent Sinhala Buddhist bourgeoisie, who financed the movement of Buddhist revival. The Buddhist petty bourgeoisie of small traders, white­collar workers, writers, journalists and teachers, with the Page 48 support of the Buddhist monks, also opposed the hegemony of Christians in colonial society. These groups spearheaded the revivalist movement to promote Buddhist education, challenge missionary influence and to arouse national and patriotic feelings among Sinhala Buddhists. Bureaucrats and missionaries were attacked for their religion and the campaign was directed at this time against the \"Christian\" presence rather than against British colonialism as such. Even if this was a tactic to avoid charges of sedition, it had the effect of arousing Buddhists to a \"holy war\" instead of an anticolonial struggle. 13 At the same time, there is the irony that the anti­Christian propaganda was partly at least financed by Buddhists who had made their fortunes trading in arrack (palm spirit), against which Buddhist temperance activists later agitated. Famous examples of Buddhist arrack traders whose fortunes later contributed to conspicuous philanthropy and the founding of many Buddhist schools were Thomas Amarasuriya and Jeronis Dias. The Kotahena Riot of 1883 A violent clash allegedly motivated by \"religious\" tensions and differences among the local populace in the nineteenth century took place between Buddhists and Roman Catholics in a populous section of Colombo called Kotahena on Easter Sunday, March 25, 1883.14 Kotahena had a strong Roman Catholic concentration, centered on the cathedral complex of St. Lucia,15 but it was also a growing commercial and residential center for an increasing Buddhist population, whose self­ consciousness was exemplified and stimulated by a vigorous monk, Migettuwatte Gunananda, who belonged to the Amarapura sect and was the presiding eminence at a Buddhist temple located in Kotahena, the Dipaduttama Vihara. Ethnic difference did not figure in this clash, for virtually all participants were Sinhalese. Gunananda, who was a native of Balapitiya in the south of the island, exemplified the new kind of monk spearheading the Buddhist revival. He was a charismatic preacher and a polemical debater, reputed to have bested his Christian adversaries in the Panadure debate of 1873, as well as an energetic organizer and fund­raiser, who procured a printing press and published tracts and pamphlets as a countermeasure to Christian missionary propaganda, and who founded the Society for the Propagation of Buddhism in 1862 in imitation of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. His activities and published views are alleged to have stimulated the arrival of Colonel Olcott in Ceylon to champion the Buddhist cause. Page 49 Gunananda quite intentionally prepared the stage for conducting celebrations and processions to mark certain building and decorative achievements in his Kotahena temple. These merit­making processions (pinkama) were not merely public expressions of Buddhist piety. They were also displays of Buddhist strength in public space—the streets of Kotahena and Mutwal and neighboring wards. Only a few hundred yards separated the Roman Catholic cathedral of St. Lucia from the Dipaduttama Vihara, founded in 1832, on land purchased with the help of private donations, by the monk Sinigama Dhirakkhanda, whose incumbency had in due course passed to his sister's son, Gunananda, in 1858. 16 \"The establishment of the Dipaduttama Vihara at Kotahena met the demand for Buddhist religious services \\[on the part\\] of the new business community who migrated to Colombo from the southern province. There were cinnamon, coir, spice and furniture dealers among them, and being southerners they belonged to a number of castes. Most of them were non­Goyigamas. Though there was another vihara in Kotahena, \\[affiliated with\\] the traditional and conservative Siyam Nikaya, they did not extend their patronage to it.\"17 Upon completion of interior decorations and other building improvements at the Dipaduttama temple, the most significant of which was the construction of a large reclining statue of the Buddha, Gunananda arranged the staging of a lengthy festival of \"unusual magnificence\" to mark the occasion, a climactic rite being the ceremony of \"opening the eyes\" of the Buddha statue (netra pinkama). The painting of the eyes ritually animates the Buddha's radiant presence. In January 1883, under the leadership of their monk, the lay devotees of the Buddhist temple gave notice of a grand festival to be held from February 8th to March 31st. \"Arrangements were made for reading pirit and preaching bana for six or seven weeks, and it was proposed to invite five hundred priests to be present on the 31st March (the last day of the festival) in order that five hundred sections of the 'Tripitaka' scriptures might be repeated by them in one day, and five hundred 'atapirikara' (the eight articles which constitute the personal property of a Buddhist priest), presented to them. These articles were to be brought with perahera \\[procession\\] and offered to the vihara by the Buddhist inhabitants of the villages in the neighbourhood of Colombo.\"18 In the meantime, smallpox had broken out in the city of Colombo, and the principal civil medical officer requested the postponement of any ceremonies likely to bring large numbers of people together. It seems that Gunananda at first agreed to comply but subsequently decided not to do so. Page 50 Notices, purporting to be issued under the authority of Migettuwatte Unnanse, to bring in offerings with the usual perahera, were sent from Kotahena temple to the villages round Colombo, and Buddhist processions, which seem to have had the general sanction of the police without formal license, came to the vihara almost daily from about the middle of February. . . . . . . The Roman Catholics first tired of, and then became irritated at, the constant parade of Buddhist rejoicing, which had been going on for days and weeks, and seemed likely to last for months. They saw large processions, accompanied by music, conveying offerings to the temple, daily passing their cathedral during the season of Lent, and at last they realized the fact that if these peraheras continued, they might interfere with their own assemblies and festivals during Holy Week. This naturally aroused their jealousy and anger, and they began to fancy that all kinds of slights and insults to their religion were intended. 19 From then on a series of moves on the part of Buddhists and Catholics, further compounded by contradictory decisions by the police and civil authorities about who might or might not hold processions during the Christian Holy Week before Easter, inevitably led to a climactic street battle. As noted, Gunananda, \"the chief priest\" of Dipaduttama Vihara, had planned for festivities to begin on February 8th and to conclude on March 31st. March 23d was chosen for the climactic ritual of \"opening the eyes\" of the Buddha statue because, being the day of the full moon, it was an auspicious time. The question has been raised whether Gunananda deliberately chose the month of March for his Buddhist festivities knowing full well, having lived for some years in Kotahena in proximity to the cathedral, that Holy Week, from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday, was a key period in the Roman Catholic calendar. The month of March is not a time for festivities in the traditional Buddhist calendar. From the Roman Catholics' point of view, March was the season of Lent, and Holy Week was of particular importance for their religious observances, particularly Good Friday, the day on which Christ was crucified, which fell that year on March 23d, and Easter Sunday, the day of Christ's resurrection, which fell on March 25th. It had been customary for the Catholics to hold processions on Palm Sunday, Good Friday, and Easter Day. As things stood, the Buddhist festivities at the temple a few hundred yards away from St. Lucia would extend through Holy Week, and although the Buddhists had hitherto been allowed to hold festivities, Catholic sensitivities began to simmer when it became clear that there would be competitive and irreconcilable festivities taking place simultaneously on Good Fri­ Page 51 day. There was some muddling on the part of the police when they first issued a license for the Buddhists to hold their procession on Good Friday, 20 then took into account the Roman Catholics' customary request for a procession on the same day, as well as their objections to a rival Buddhist procession on that day, and finally persuaded Gunananda to call off his procession. However, the police got the consent of the Roman Catholic bishop for the Buddhists to hold their procession on Easter Sunday between 1:30 and 4 P.M. after the Roman Catholics had completed their services in the morning. But feelings had been stirred, mischievous rumors had been launched, and the Good Friday buildup had only barely been defused. The compromise of having Christian and Buddhist processions and festivities at two separate times on Easter Sunday did not keep the two sides apart. The Roman Catholics had held their services on Easter morning and had dispersed, but \"a little before one o'clock the neighbourhood was alarmed by the sudden ringing of the bells in all Roman Catholic churches in the neighbourhood, and without delay, as if at a preconcerted signal, large bodies of men ready armed with clubs, and marked on the forehead and back with white crosses, began to assemble at St. Lucia's corner.\"21 The Catholics were thoroughly enraged by rumors that the Buddhists were carrying a cross with a monkey nailed to it and a statue resembling the Virgin Mary. The peaceful and unarmed Buddhist procession, with women and children in attendance, became transformed when it reached the canal bridge on Skinner's Road, less than half a mile from St. Lucia's. Upon hearing a rumor that a Buddhist priest had been assaulted, the menfolk rushed into a timber yard close by and took sticks and whatever else could serve as weapons. The police, caught in between, ordered the Catholics to disperse, and on their refusing, made a charge, which was greeted by brickbats and stones. The Buddhists, \"in order to force a passage, attempted to drive their carts through the Catholic mob, but the latter seized and killed their bullocks, broke up the carts and burned them and their contents on the public highway.\" Thereafter, the crowds dispersed. Two people had been killed and about thirty injured, including twelve constables. The next day, March 26, there were two other Buddhist processions on their way to the Kotahena temple, one from Koratota, a village some ten or twelve miles from Colombo, and the other from Peliyagoda, situated on the city's outskirts. The latter was armed this time with clubs, swords, muskets, and other weapons and was bent on violence. Meanwhile, a Roman Catholic crowd assembled at Kotahena was in an excited state because rumor had it that a Catholic priest had been assaulted. This day, how­ Page 52 ever, not only armed police but also men from the Royal Dublin Fusiliers were on duty, and they managed to turn back the Buddhist processions before any clashes could take place. The famous \"Kotahena riot\" was actually a limited episode that lasted one day (or at most two, if the abortive processions on March 26 are counted as a continuation of the violence). Fewer than ten thousand people took part, according to one estimate, and the outbreak was not directed against the British colonial authorities but was part of the infighting for space, influence, and presence among two Sinhalese religious communities competing first of all in Colombo and only secondarily elsewhere in the island. 22 Outside Kotahena itself, sporadic violence occurred for a few days. On Monday, March 26, a Roman Catholic chapel at Dehiwela, just south of Colombo, was burned, and there were other attacks on Catholic property. At Ratmalana, also to the south of the city, Buddhists paraded a cross after hearing a rumor that Christians were carrying a yellow robe on a pole.23 Rumors were rife, but violence fizzled out. The commission that inquired into the riots was composed of F. R. Saunders, government agent, Western Province, Lt. Colonel J. Duncan of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, and J. H. DeSaram, district judge, Kurunegala. There were no Catholics or Buddhists on it, and all the members were government officials. In summing up, this commission enumerated the following as the causes of the riots: 1. The proximity of the Buddhist temple and the Roman Catholic cathedral at Kotahena. 2. The gradual revival of Buddhism and the controversies consequent thereon. 3. The protracted nature of the Buddhist festival and the grand scale on which it was carried out by so bitter an opponent of the Christian religion as Migettuwatte Unnanse. 4. The continuance of the Buddhist festival throughout Holy Week. 5. The spreading of false reports regarding insults to the Christian religion, which were believed by the Roman Catholics and greatly exasperated them. 6. The apparent inability of the Roman Catholic authorities to control the more ignorant of their flock. 7. The indiscretion and indecision displayed by the police in granting, withholding, and canceling licenses. 8. The insufficiency of the information possessed by the police, defective arrangements made by them, and their failure properly to enforce the Page 53 law at the first sign of trouble or to grasp the magnitude of the disturbance until it was too late. 24 All these were indeed components of the chain of events culminating in the Easter riot at Kotahena. This sequence of events is, as we shall see, typical of the phases civilian riots go through as short­lived, unstable phenomena. For various reasons, the police force on the spot at times of collective violence linked to \"ethnic\" conflict (ethnicity itself being broadly understood as implicating allegedly \"racial\" or \"blood'' links, linguistic, religious, and territorial bonds, and mytho­historical continuities) is usually unprepared and unable to cope with riots and similar civilian outbursts. Usually, too, it is the army, called in later, that is perceived as more effective in restoring order. A prominent role is played in such disturbances by processions of demonstrators, accompanied by loud music and carrying emblems, flags, statues, and placards, embellished by slogans, insults, and boasts. The timing and presentation of such parades are integrally linked to the religious and civil calendar of festivals and commemorative rites and to other features of public culture. The processions themselves mobilize people for public support and action. Parading through streets, past civil and religious buildings and monuments, and converging and aggregating at squares and parks and maidans is a public display of social presence and the taking command of space and territory, some of which belongs to the \"enemy,\" whether it be an ethnic other, the \"government,\" or an opponent \"class\" or caste. Collective presentation of identity and self, mobilization and show of social support, public staging of protest laced with rhetorical speech and music and, above all, noise: this is how collective causes are to a large extent pursued. At some stage, violence becomes a primary mode of conducting politics and achieving certain objectives. Another important feature that needs to be recognized is the role of rumors, later found to be false, but which at the time are believed and serve to fuel rioting, inciting people to arm themselves, band together, and be ready to commit violence. At Kotahena, both sides believed that their respective priests had been attacked, and the Catholics believed that their sacred symbols were being insulted. The power of rumor in triggering action should not be underestimated. The Kotahena riot of 1883 might well be regarded as a manifestation of early Sinhala Buddhist nationalism, which the British authorities failed to recognize at that time. There is no doubt that the Catholics felt that the Page 54 Buddhists were invading their sacred space. \"The offence on the part of the Buddhists consisted of their taking the images so near the cathedral,\" Monsignor Pagnani told the investigating commission. Bells were rung to summon the faithful to block the Buddhist procession. \"We have no hesitation in stating that we believe the illegal assemblies, both on Good Friday and Easter­day were thoroughly organized and previously arranged by the Roman Catholics, with the express purpose of attacking Buddhist processions,\" the commission concluded. 25 It is likely that British official sentiment was prejudiced against the Roman Catholic Church (the colonial government had withdrawn the special privileges it granted the Anglican Church, as an expression of its \"religious neutrality,\" only in 1880), and that the authorities that granted licenses to stage processions did not want to displease the Buddhists.26 Be that as it may, the Buddhist leaders, now strengthened by Olcott's propagandist abilities, not only felt that they were the injured party, but mounted an agitation whose pregnant significance was missed by the authorities. Protesting that they were the victims of attacks by Catholic mobs, the Buddhist leaders insistently asked that the rioters who had been apprehended near St. Lucia's on Easter Sunday be brought to court, and that the injuries done to Buddhists and their property be redressed. Absent reliable evidence and the necessary witnesses to prosecute them, the colonial authorities had released those apprehended, however, and they kept evading the Buddhist request. The findings of Governor Longden's Commission of Inquiry did not satisfy the Buddhist leaders. They wanted the Colonial Office to hold a separate inquiry. A Buddhist Defence Committee was formed, both to seek redress and with other objectives in mind. Colonel Olcott, who made his second visit to the island in January 1884, joined the committee and was asked to present the Buddhist case in London. In addition to raising the question of bringing the rioters to court, Olcott proposed to the Colonial Office that the Buddhist community be empowered to manage property belonging to the Sangha, because the monks were prohibited by the rules of their ordination from \"meddling in worldly affairs\"; that Wesak be declared a public holiday for Buddhist government employees; that Buddhist registrars of marriage be appointed in Buddhist villages and city wards; that religious processions accompanied by the beating of tom­toms be allowed to resume. \"Harsh and unpleasant as the sound of tom toms may be to European ears, yet it is music to the Asiatic, and a festival without it is lifeless and uninteresting to them,\" Olcott explained to the colonial secretary, Lord Derby. \"Discontent and despair are rapidly Page 55 spreading among the Sinhalese Buddhists,\" he added, saying that prior to the promotion of the manufacture and sale of arrack by the colonial authorities, the Sinhalese had been \"a most kindly, quiet and virtuous nation.\" Their devotion to Buddhism had survived the bloody policies of the Portuguese and the despicable craftiness of the Dutch, and they now felt \"as though the \\[present\\] ruling power were secretly willing to deliver them over to the Romish mob, and determined to deny them common protection.\" 27 Olcott's intervention did little to achieve redress of Buddhist grievances over the Kotahena riot; but the Buddhist revival had for the first time made its voice heard in London independently of the official colonial channels of communication via the governor.28 The riot was not merely a religious clash between Roman Catholics and Buddhists. It was also an early stirring of the ambitions of a Buddhist majority whose purposes and future were being shaped by leaders whose religious, political, and economic hopes were beginning to be articulated within the colonial framework, prefiguring organized attempts, not only to win greater concessions and recognition from the British Raj, but also to launch a Buddhist nationalism of the Sinhalese majority, of which Anagarika Dharmapala and his associates would be the chief advocates. In 1915, in the midst of a world war, the British were to misread and grossly exaggerate the anticolonial dimensions and objectives of the \"Sinhalese­ Muslim\" riots, which, although they had ethnic, religious, economic, and sociopolitical strands, were not yet a move in the direction of resistance to colonial rule and emancipation from it. Although prominent monks like Gunananda and Sumangala were the leaders of the Buddhist revival up to the 1880s, in subsequent years, the most conspicuous defenders of Buddhist interests, and critics of Christian missions, were not ordained monks but laymen. Among them were Dharmapala, who fashioned the new role of the anagarika, and his follower and associate Walisinha Harischandra (1877–1913). Harischandra, a member of the Maha Bohdi Society who campaigned for government protection of sacred sites in the ancient capital of Anuradhapura in the North Central Province, led protests in June 1903 during the Buddhist poson festivities to persuade the government to lift the restrictions placed on Buddhist processions. A minor anti­Christian riot ensued in Anuradhapura, during which, among other things, a Roman Catholic church was burned and a slaughterhouse destroyed. Harischandra was arrested for inciting it, but was later acquitted. This antigovernment riot took place during the customary full­moon pilgrimage to the city. \"Only a few hundred of an estimated ten thousand pilgrims present. . . took part in the riot. Many Low Country Page 56 men \\[people from the southwestern province\\] were said to be involved. They left town immediately after the riot and managed to avoid arrest.\" 29 The Alleged Causes of the 1915 Riots A widely accepted explanation of the 1915 riots runs as follows: \"The riots were the culmination of developing antagonism between the Sinhalese population and the 'Coast Moors,' recent Muslim immigrants from Southern India. The causes for this ill­feeling were mainly economic and religious. The Sinhalese resented the virtual monopoly enjoyed by Muslims over petty trade in foodstuffs. The War with its shortages and high prices caused considerable hardship to the people and it was easy to believe that these Muslim traders were exploiting the situation.\"30 But the immediate precipitating or triggering event leading up to the riots was the familiar one of religious processions playing music while passing Muslim mosques. Rioting broke out in Kandy after midnight on May 28, 1915, and continued intermittently for two days until May 30. By June 1, rioting had spread to Colombo and the Western Province, and by the next day, it had ignited in the Southern, Central, Northwestern, and Sabaragamuwa provinces. The disturbances were more or less brought under control, after some nine days, by June 6, although isolated outbreaks occurred for some days afterwards. In actual area, the space affected, including towns, was about three hundred square miles. According to one account, at least thirty­nine people were killed by the rioters, and damage to property was estimated at six million rupees.31 Martial law was proclaimed on June 2 in the five affected provinces, and was withdrawn only on August 30. At least sixty­three people were killed by the military and police in suppressing the riots, and many prominent Sinhalese leaders of elitist connections were imprisoned on charges of sedition. A second account sums up the damage as follows: \"From a communal clash up­country, disorders spread into six of Ceylon's nine provinces, causing the deaths of 140 people, the arrests of 8,786, imprisonment of 4,497 and at a cost of about Rs. 7,000,000.\"32 Floggings and shootings by English volunteers mobilized to quell the riots—mainly tea planters and employees of Colombo commercial firms—were worse than anything the rioters did. Governor Sir John Anderson, who replaced Sir Robert Chalmers, would later condemn these atrocities.33 The outbreak of World War I had spawned anxieties and suspicions. Suggestions of German intrigue seemed plausible to the British, and perhaps the vague knowledge that Turkey and the Caliphate of Islam were Page 57 enemies of His Majesty's government, strengthened by the news of the arrest in Egypt of the ex­sultan of the Maldive Islands (a Ceylon dependency) for pan­Islamic propaganda, may have made some of the Sinhalese Buddhists believe that punitive actions against the Muslims in Ceylon would be tolerated. 34 Another indirectly relevant factor contributing to the turmoil may have been the centenary of the Kandyan Convention of 1815, when the last Sinhalese kingdom yielded to British rule, under conditions stated in a treaty. The alleged nonobservance of certain understandings inscribed in this treaty regarding the continued governmental protection and patronage of the Buddhist religion (Article 5) was a matter of bitter complaint among certain segments of the Buddhist clergy and many budding \"nationalist\" leaders.35 But the most decisive and weightiest circumstances that dictated the violent actions against the Muslims, the Coast Moors in particular, but not exclusively, were, according to many commentators, more \"economic\" in the first instance, although clearly the economic grievances and prejudices were also closely and decisively linked with the emergent commercial and business interests of certain low­country urban Sinhalese, who were also the champions of Buddhist revivalism. For example, the newspaper Sinhala Jatiya, edited by Piyadasa Sirisena at this time, not only invoked a Sinhalese \"National Awakening\" but in tandem also carried anti­Moor stories in its columns shortly before the 1915 riots. By 1915, World War I had created shortages of food and imported goods and a simultaneous rise in prices. Coast Moor traders, who were prominent in Colombo and the other towns in the retail trade in foodstuffs, and who had already been negatively stereotyped among the Sinhalese, were inevitably accused of creating artificial increases in the prices of necessities. \"The charges against the Coast Moors were that they were unscrupulous, alien (some compared them to Jews; others, in 1915, to Germans), and they loaned money at usurious rates. . . . Before the 1915 riots, Sinhalese had boycotted Coast Moormen's boutiques (general merchandise shops and food counters) as a warning to them to desist from attempting to seduce Sinhalese girls.\"36 Kumari Jayawardena has highlighted the powerful economic ingredients of the 1915 riots. In the villages and towns of colonial Ceylon, small shops run by Coast Moors, who came from and frequently returned to South India, provided the foodstuffs and other necessities of life for the poor, and these shopkeepers often acted as pawnbrokers and moneylenders. \"Restrictions on trade and a shortage of freight caused a decline in imports and exports in the first year of the war. Several of Ceylon's main products were affected by the slump, and a fall in coconut prices and the depression in Page 58 plumbago \\[graphite\\] and rubber resulted in a reduction of wages and the retrenchment of labor in these industries. There was also an increase in unemployment among skilled workers in the towns. The shortages caused by the war led to a sharp and sudden rise in the price of foodstuffs and other necessities, which were most keenly felt by the poor.\" 37 In the context of such contracting horizons, it was a general complaint of the time that retail traders were exacting exorbitant prices from poor people. And the Coast Moors were marked out by the Sinhalese public as the embodiment of this rapacity. Sinhalese newspapers and Buddhist journals led a campaign against minority groups. For example, in 1909, a leading journalist, Piyadasa Sirisena, advised the Sinhalese to \"refrain from having transactions with the Coast Moor, the Cochin and the foreigner.\" In the same year, the Mahabodhi Journal, published in English by Anagarika Dharmapala, denounced the \"merchants from Bombay and peddlers from South India\" who traded in Ceylon, while the \"sons of the soil\" abandoned agriculture to \"work like galley slaves in urban clerical jobs.\" Sinhala Bauddhaya, also run by Dharmapala, was most vociferous in its attacks. ''From the day the foreign white man stepped in this country, the industries, habits and customs of the Sinhalese began to disappear and now the Sinhalese are obliged to fall at the feet of the Coast Moors and Tamils,\" it complained in 1912. \"A suitable plan should be adopted to send this damnable lot \\[the Coast Moors\\] out of the country,\" a Sinhalese­language newspaper, Lakmina, declared in 1915, when the hostility between Buddhists and Muslims had increased. Another paper, Dinamina, spoke of \"our inveterate enemies, the Moors.\"38 Some of the editors of Sinhalese newspapers that carried inflammatory letters making complaints against Moor traders were charged under martial law in 1915, and papers like Sinhala Bauddhaya and Sinhala Jatiya were banned by the government. Rioting Begins in Kandy Although the most violent foci of the riots were in the low country, and in Colombo and its suburbs in particular, they did not begin there, but up­country in Kandy, preceded by the controversy in the town of Gampola about the objections of the Coast Moors to noisy Buddhist processions passing their mosques, which had been simmering for years (see map 1). In February 1915, after much legal wrangling, the Supreme Court of Ceylon ruled against the Buddhists in Gampola. Charles Blackton describes what followed: Within a fortnight, clashes took place between Buddhists and Moors in Kandy, Kurunegela, and Badulla. Piyadasa Sirisena's Sinhala Jatiya (March 9, 1915) Page 59 Map 1. Sri Lanka Page 60 reported on the \"outrages\" by Moors against Buddhists in Kurunegela. The governor, Sir Robert Chalmers, cited an attempt by Buddhists in Kandy to block the pavement in front of Moormen's boutiques \"at a spot where Buddhist processions had of recent years been accustomed to halt and distribute alms,\" a hint that Buddhists were setting their faces against Islam. Coast Moors and Afghans were reported to have attacked a Hindu procession in Kandy near the Castle Hill Street mosque where the riots were soon to begin. It had become a more than usually troublesome spring. Yet, as Wesak (May 28) approached, when thousands of pilgrims from all across the island would pour into Kandy to revere the Buddha on his birthday, there was no apprehension of riots, other than a police directive to make certain that no trouble developed during the procession in the vicinity of the Castle Hill Street mosque. 39 In general, it is true to say that when riots actually explode, they come as a shock to most of those caught up in them; but it is also true that after the event, many retrospectively recognize the buildup of tensions and the warning signals. The Coast Moor shopkeepers and traders of Kandy had only recently rebuilt their chief mosque, which they had inaugurated with festivity in March 1915. The mosque stood prominently on Castle Hill Street, one of the main streets of Kandy. Wesak, the day on which Buddha was born and on which he later attained enlightenment, fell on May 28, and in anticipation, several Buddhists had applied for licenses to set up alms stalls (dansalas). In this particular year, some Muslim traders had objected that these stalls would cut into their trade, but licenses were issued when Sinhalese municipal councilors intervened. Next, the issue of processions increased the growing tensions. A. P. Kannangara describes the escalation as follows: For the previous twenty­five years or so it had been the practice on Wesak night for parties of Buddhist \"carol singers\" and musicians to tour the streets of Kandy in bullock carts. In April 1915 some prominent Coast Moors in Kandy told the superintendent of police of their fears that this time the \"carol­procession\" would lead to disturbances. He declined to forbid the processions, but specifically prohibited them from playing music while passing any mosque. Nevertheless he was later persuaded to give permission for the carol­parties to play at the house of a prominent Buddhist businessman, although it stood only a few yards away from the mosque. The understanding was that the performance would take place after midnight by when prayers there would have ended for the day. At midnight on 28th May, when the carol­carts each with a crowd behind it were moving towards the Buddhist businessman's house, they found the mosque lit up and a crowd of Muslims watching them from within. As trouble seemed likely, the police inspector on duty tried to divert the processions. But he failed. There was a clash, the procession broke up, and the mosque and some nearby Muslim shops were damaged.40 Page 61 Blackton gives a somewhat different account, but there is no doubt about the time—the early morning hours of May 29—and place of the clash that led to the attack on the mosque in Kandy. The city was thronged with crowds, consisting both of locals and of pilgrims and sightseers from other provinces. A procession consisting of seven elephants, led by the Dalada Maligawa's giant tusker bearing the Buddha's tooth in a jeweled casket, made a stately circuit of the town, escorted by drummers, dancers, and torchbearers. 41 The procession went according to normal plans until it neared the new mosque in Castle Hill Street. The singers had apparently agreed to be silent as they passed this place of worship. The crowd, however, had grown to great size and so the police decided to divert the procession away from the mosque entirely. The procession directors agreed to this but, as one account puts it, as the procession turned back \"some Moormen outside the mosque jeered and hooted as if they had bested the Buddhists after all. So they later returned, attacked the Moormen and wrecked the mosque, going on to attack their shops.\"42 The events in Kandy are vividly described by the Reverend A. G. Fraser, principal of a boys' school called Trinity College, who marshaled some of the masters and students of the school to restrain the rioters. Around 3 A.M. on the morning of May 29, Fraser wrote, there was \"an attack on that mosque, which had been most aggressive in its objections to dansala and processions.\" It was an empty shell next morning. \"No one had been killed or hurt, and the Moors had brought the attack on themselves, by their religious intolerance.\" By evening of the same day, a Saturday, crowds began to collect, and \"mischief was afoot.\" Fraser \"went down in dinner dress\" at about 9 P.M. to see for himself and found ''the crowd were armed with clubs and had great beams to use as battering rams.\" Led by \"Low­Country Sinhalese—a much less religious, and more deliberately dangerous set of men than were in evidence the previous night,\" they had smashed up a jeweler's shop and assaulted the superintendent of police. More attacks were launched against Moor shops and houses on orders given \"by one of these leaders,\" and at one end of the street, a Sinhalese was shot by a Moor. \"Meantime, too much arrack was being drunk.\"43 In Kandy the police never mastered the mobs during their first outburst. W. T. Stace and his small police force dispersed mobs only to have them reform around the next corner and begin looting there. The police seem to have been unable to arrest any of the original disturbers. Given the panic mood and the inflated size of the population, police with truncheons constituted an inadequate force. Fraser writes that later that Saturday night, crowds began to move from Kandy toward the adjacent localities of Page 62 Katukelle and Gatembe, where the crowd had burned the local mosque by 4 A.M. on Sunday morning (the 30th). By Sunday afternoon, the crowds had formed again in the central streets of Kandy. On Trincomalee Street, Fraser saw \"a crowd of about a thousand, armed with knives and clubs attacking a Moor house. Two Moors were killed, and a Sinhalese man lay bleeding and stabbed in front of us.\" 44 Similar things happened on the 31st, and reports were received that crowds were committing arson in Kadugannawa, ten miles away, and that Punjabi troops sent from Colombo were charging them. On June 1, the governor arrived in Kandy, and martial law was declared the following day (June 2). Fraser's account tallies with those provided by other sources. On the evening of the 29th, crowds moved down the Kandy­Peradeniya road, reaching Gatembe in the dawn hours. A British observer found \"the street littered with piles of burning loot and ashes, the village mosque burned out.\"45 During the morning, rumors flew in Kandy that gangs of Moors were coming to destroy the Dalada Maligawa (the Temple of the Tooth) in retaliation for mosques wrecked. In fact, a group of twenty­ five to thirty Moors did travel up by train, but they were intercepted by police at Kadugannawa. By evening, however, Sinhalese gangs were loose in Kandy's streets, and the governor, notified of this second outbreak, ordered the sending of more police from Colombo and one hundred troopers of the 28th Punjabi regiment, garrisoned in Ceylon. The reinforcements arrived in Kandy at dawn on Saturday, May 30th. This draining­off of police from the Western Province may inadvertently have set the stage for the mass looting in Colombo. After Inspector General Dowbiggin took charge in Kandy, \"reports came in of disturbances in the direction of Kadugannawa to the west, Gampola to the south, Teldeniya to the east, and Panwila to the north of Kandy.\" Dowbiggin personally led a force toward Kadugannawa, while sending parties by car to these danger points. He saw much damage and disarmed some Sinhalese. Halfway to Kadugannawa, there was a mêlée. Having collected a crowd, F.P. Walgampahe, the basnayake nilame of the Gadaladeniya Devale, appeared, in Dowbiggin's words, \"brandishing an open knife.\" Walgampahe was injured and died before reaching hospital. This case was to be revived by the Sinhalese mission in London in later days. Let us now pause here for a moment and take in the intriguing significance of Fraser's pointed reference to \"Low­Country Sinhalese\" leading and directing the mob just twelve hours after the first outburst in Kandy. \"The mass of rioters were out against Mohammedans pure and simple on Page 63 economic and religious grounds, and without design against British Rule, some indeed believing an attack on Mohammedans would be popular as the Empire was fighting Turkey,\" Fraser wrote D.B. Jayatilaka (who was in London with E.W. Perera to ventilate the grievances arising from prosecutions for alleged participation in the riots) on August 25, 1917. He averred that in his opinion, there was \"no doubt that the riots were organized in advance, that there was a small clique of men hostile to Government and representing the opinion of a man like Dharmapala, whose articles were read and who was flattered and well received, and this clique exploited the hatred of the Mohammedans by directing attention to them, and probably in organizing and starting the first chief riot outbreaks. But they were not typical of the people as a whole or of the nation.\" In a postscript to this letter, he added: \"That there was a planned start and some organization I as living in Kandy can have no doubt.\" 46 In a subsequent letter to Jayatilaka, dated September 5, 1917, while firmly denying that \"there was any conspiracy on the part of the Cingalese against the Government,\" Fraser reiterated that he found it \"difficult to believe that there was no organization in advance. For one thing I knew that the riots were going to take place before they took place and warned the authorities to be on their guard in order that there might be no trouble.\"47 Events in the Kandyan and Northwestern Provinces The disorders at Gampola occurred on May 30, only a day behind those in Kandy, when the town began to fill with strangers. J.R. Walters and his police could not move them on. As darkness fell, a bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) addressed the crowd, shouts of \"Sadhu!\" (Holy!) were raised, and a gang rushed several Moor shops. Walters phoned for help and intervened until all but four of his men had faded away, some injured. The Moors defended the mosque with guns, but it was almost gutted. By the time Walters, \"despairing of reinforcements,\" distributed rifles and dispersed the mob, most Moor premises had been sacked, and the Moors had fled. Walters reported his view that this riot had been planned. The Moors returned on June 1, and the troubles moved on again. Similar events were taking place at Matale on the same day. The assistant government agent (A.G.A.) there doubted any local plot and blamed outsiders. North and east of Kandy in the Pata Dumbara­Uda Dumbara area, the A.G.A. reported that lootings were organized by priests, headmen, and notaries, backed by schoolmasters and low­country traders and stirred to action by persistent rumors that the government wanted the Page 64 Moors expelled, Moors were planning to attack Buddhist temples, and \"British rule ended on the 27th; Buddhism is reviving.\" 48 Further up­country at Nuwara Eliya, energetic measures, warning of Moors, banning of processions, closing of drink shops, and conferences with communal leaders contained the rioting within a few days. During the worst outburst at Nuwara Eliya, all Buddhist houses showed lighted paper lanterns, presumably to ensure their owners freedom from molestation by looters. Of these areas, remote Uva Province suffered the least disturbance. There, as elsewhere, Kandyan chiefs helped British officials keep the peace. In North Central Province and the two Tamil provinces, no riots were reported. Sabaragamuwa and Northwestern Province, between Kandy and Colombo, through which rioters and pilgrims moved westward in the days after the Kandy riots, became an area of severe disorders. Fierce action was reported from Rambukkana and Kegalle (June 1–2) and Ratnapura (June 2–3). Officials at Kurunegala reported a new factor: gangs moving eastward across the Maha Oya, precipitating widespread looting of Moors on the approaches to the low country. Goondas (thugs) were replacing the frightened villagers. False proclamations and rumors undermined the effectiveness of small police detachments until Punjabi infantry put the gangs down with point­blank fire. Similar patterns took shape in Puttalam­Chilaw, in Siyane Korale East (where one gang engaged the police while another struck its target), and in the Veyangoda area, locus of the most persistent violence. Rioting in Colombo The proximate beginning of the riots in Colombo is recorded in the diary of J.G. Fraser, the Western Province government agent, who was presiding at a meeting of the Sanitary Board on May 31 when, at about 4:00 P.M., he was called away by J.H. Daniels (the senior police officer in Colombo since the inspector general had been ordered up­country). Sinhalese railway fitters, alleged to be chronically unruly, had clashed with Moors near the factory yard, and Daniels asked Fraser to call out the troops. Fraser, with several Sinhalese leaders, went to the yard, and after a conference, the workers dispersed sullenly. Fraser later recalled that returning home, he \"did not . . . like the appearance of the people on the streets and began to connect the incident in Colombo with events in Kandy.\" Acting on his intuition, he alerted the military, and half an hour later, at 6:30 P.M., a phone call told him rioting had broken out in the Pettah commercial district. He sent police patrols into the Maradana and Borella areas, only to find the police Page 65 \"worse than useless,\" perhaps because they were few and only armed with truncheons against very large, if uncertain, mobs. Police leadership had been sent off to Kandy with the best constables. Only the troops brought some calm by midnight, as Fraser—cruising by car with the mayor—observed. The governor, Sir Robert Chalmers, had reached Kandy when, on May 31, he heard that rioters were on the streets in Colombo. He had already ordered General H.H.L. Malcolm to Colombo. Stubbs, the colonial secretary, arrived in Colombo the next morning and reported the rioting to Chalmers as \"sporadic.\" The next day Stubbs wrote a private note to a friend at the Colonial Office in London describing events in more ominous terms: looting all day, the police ineffective, \"the scum of Colombo have seized their opportunity,\" troops too few to cope with the shifting, regrouping gangs. The troops were attacked about 9 P.M., and they fired on the mob, clearing the streets. Stubbs, having worked himself into a \"Sepoy Mutiny\" state of mind, warned that having ''tasted loot,\" the mobs might attack European bungalows, and that martial law was now imperative. Still at Kandy, the governor proclaimed martial law in several provinces, including the Western Province, on June 2 and then returned to Colombo. He described Colombo as quiet but perturbed after much destruction, numerous murders, and shooting by troops. When Stubbs wrote his Whitehall friend again on June 8, he suggested that the governor's dispatches failed to show the full scope of the damage and danger. The military command, on June 2, reported that armed parties advancing upon Colombo from four directions that afternoon had been dispersed. Most of the violence in the city was over by then. But numbers of Moors had fled with their families to India or had taken refuge in the Colombo municipality. Events in the Western and Southern Provinces Moors and property were attacked in about six hundred villages in the Western Province. The commissioner for Kalutara, Festing, declared: \"Each village appears to have turned out en masse for the destruction of Moorish property in its vicinity and to have furnished a detachment to march with the nucleus of rioters from such centers as Colombo and Siyane Korale East upon the next center to be attacked.\" This view became the basis for the later theory that every village in riot districts should pay compensation, except those that were not Buddhist or could prove their innocence. The whole Panadura­Kalutara area, immediately south of Colombo, was preplanned for uprising, Festing felt. Property owners manipulated \"street­ Page 66 leaders,\" who stirred up the masses with stories of assaults on Sinhalese women and attacks on Buddhist temples. He had seen some pamphlets of an \"inflammatory\" nature handed out during the past year at meetings in Buddhist schools, where the ringleaders were \"Buddhists of Fisher Caste.\" He regretfully noted that most minor headmen \"were in it.\" Abdul Rahiman and other prominent Moors toured the stricken areas shortly after the riots and, although intensely prejudiced, their reports turned up data that sometimes corroborated other sources—details of damaged communities, desecrated and dynamited mosques, smashed bazaars, looted shops, burned homes, and the inadequacy and occasional complicity of the police. There had been some anti­British speeches. A month before the riots, the president of the village tribunal of Welitara had publicly threatened to expel the Moors for their dishonesty. Nationalist cards and slogans appeared. In Atulugama, weeks before the riots, a series of meetings were allegedly held in Buddhist schools, and Moors were sternly excluded \"from even the neighborhood\" of these sessions. Abdul Rahiman's report ended on a vengeful note, ''for the insult hurled at Islam some visible and abiding mark must be put upon Buddhist temples, if for no other reason, at least to preserve the prestige of the British Raj.\" 49 Faces in the Crowd Recalling George Rudé's citations of Taine and Burke, who characterized the participants in the French Revolution as \"mobs\" made up of criminals, vagabonds, and assassins,50 Kumari Jayawardena notes that some Ceylonese writers have similarly described the rioting and looting that took place in Colombo as the work of \"street rowdies, looters, habitual criminals and their henchmen.\"51 But in actual fact the mobs \"were composed of the urban workers and city poor\" and were led \"by skilled workers, in particular the railway locomotive men who struck work in 1912.\" Taking her cue from Eric Hobsbawm's observation that the movement of food prices was an almost \"infallible indicator\" of popular unrest in Paris during the French Revolution, Jayawardena remarks that \"much the same was true of the Colombo poor, who faced a growth of unemployment and a rapid rise in prices after the outbreak of the First World War.\"52 And the Moor traders were targets because they were accused of taking advantage of the situation and raising the prices of necessities. People of working and laboring status in the Colombo of 1915 were \"not an organized working class in the modern sense,\" but they were militant Page 67 and had staged a series of agitations, culminating in the strike of 1912. Moreover, as Jayawardena surmises, the workers \"were no doubt readers of the Sinhalese language press, which at that time was conducting an aggressive campaign against Indian traders and Indian workers in Ceylon.\" And it was specifically the Sinhalese railway workers who had shown hostility to Indian immigrant labor as competitors and potential blacklegs. \"In 1910, for example, the locomotive workers had protested against the influx of South Indian workers on the railways, and in 1913, in presenting their grievances before the Railway Commission, they complained that Indian Tamils and Malayalis were employed in preference to Sinhalese.\" 53 Jayawardena gives us a vivid account of the buildup of tensions and the gathering of a crowd in an ugly mood that first broke out in rioting in Colombo. Her description of the behavior of the crowd, its targeting of shops, arson, and destruction of property accompanied by looting rings many bells for those familiar with other urban riots. I can do no better than quote her in extenso, while noting that her explanations are couched primarily in economic terms: The details of the riots that occurred in Colombo are of significance in assessing the nature of the disorders. On May 31, some of the railway workers quarreled with the Moor proprietor of a teashop located opposite the locomotive workshop in Maradana. The issue was the increase in the price of a cup of tea, and the workers, having made allusions to the rioting against Moors in Kandy, returned to their work yard and pelted the shop with stones. The police were summoned and at the end of the day the railway men were asked to pass through the gate in single file so the culprits could be identified. They refused to comply and showed signs of unrest. When the workers were eventually allowed to leave, many of them had missed their last train home. The railway workers used their enforced detention in the city to contact other groups of urban workers, and it was reported that the ranks of the workers were joined by \"the idlers, the unemployed and the habitual criminals.\" The shops of Moors in the neighborhood of the railway workshops were attacked, and rioting and looting, which spread to other parts of Colombo, lasted three days. The railway locomotive men threatened to strike and a number of them stayed away from work. From several eyewitness accounts and from the governor's dispatches and police reports, it is apparent that (1) the rioting in Colombo had hardly any religious motives, (2) the targets for the attack were the shops of the Coast Moors and other Muslims, (3) there were very few assaults or killings of Moors or desecration of their mosques, and (4) the rioting was not led by the criminals of Colombo but by members of the working class, who were joined by the floating population composed of the unemployed and urban poor. The rioting in Colombo seems to have followed a similar pattern in all parts of the Page 68 city. The crowds were mainly unarmed, and those who were armed carried sticks or crowbars. It has been recorded that the procedure of rioting was for the crowd to raise a cry of \"loot\" near a Moor shop, thereby causing the owner to run away; \"the ruffians would then enter the shop and throw goods to the pavement. . . and the needy men and women who were about would carry the things away.\" The \"mob\" would then move to another part of Colombo and attack the Moor shops in that area. A police inspector, describing a group of rioters who came from Maradana to Borella in a tram, said, \"I observed the poorer classes of the residents in the neighborhood including Sinhalese, fishmongers, dhobies and rowdies making for the junction. . . looting began. . . it was the men who came in the tramcar who broke open the boutiques \\[shops\\], and immediately the resident rowdies rushed in and looted the goods.'' Although there were instances of killing or assaulting Moors and of attacks on mosques in other parts of the country, it is noteworthy that the \"mob\" in Colombo was not bent on attacking the Moors themselves or pillaging their places of worship on religious grounds, but rather on plundering the Moors' shops, which symbolized the hardships caused by profiteering and unfair trade practices. In parts of Colombo, where the Moors were strong in numbers, there was fighting between Sinhalese and Moors, but eyewitnesses were generally agreed that the crowd in Colombo aimed at destroying the Coast Moor shops rather than injuring the Moors and that \"actual death from violence by the mob was small.\" The governor admitted that the riots in Colombo were a \"sympathetic but independent outbreak, which while retaining the anti­Mohammedan stamp of the original Kandy outbreak was essentially more turbulent and criminal in character, actuated by little or no religious impulse and bent on plundering and on wounding or killing the Moor traders. The reaction of the government to the Colombo outbreak can best be understood in the context of the economic and political events preceding the riots. For, whereas religious riots could be swiftly controlled, a working­class uprising presented a far more serious prospect of economic dislocation and social upheaval. . . . A government report on the riots in the Western Province most definitely pointed the finger at the railway workers: \"The foci of disturbance on the first of June—viz. Colombo, Angulana, Veyangoda and Mirigama—point to the intimate relation between the Railway and the Riots. The leaders realized to the full the advantage to them by a means of transport which permitted their emissaries being distributed rapidly throughout the district.\" 54 It is essential to keep in view the spatial and demographic locations of Colombo's commercial centers, railway shops, port facilities, and residential places of shopkeepers and workers. Pettah, Maradana, Kotahena, and Dematagoda were the main locations of work sites, shops, and working­class habitation. And in the interstices of these complexes, many new Buddhist temples had been built and peopled by monks newly come from the provinces to service the rural migrants turned workers. Page 69 Political and Economic Facets of Buddhist Revivalism As we have seen, the Colombo riots initially began opposite the locomotive workshop in Maradana after a quarrel between some railway workers and a Moor teashop owner. But the mob attacks spread from Maradana to Borella, and they found their best targets in the Pettah, the \"native\" commercial center of Colombo, whose retail shops selling cloth, rice, groceries, imported dry goods, and so on, were at the beginning of the twentieth century dominated by Natukottai Chettiars, Muslim traders from the Malabar and Coromandel coasts and from Gujarat (e.g., the Borah and Khojas). The island's import trade was, of course, dominated by British firms, but the Pettah trade and local distribution of goods were primarily in the hands of Indian \"aliens.\" Their dominance was most keenly felt by the nascent and growing class of Sinhalese low­country Buddhist merchants and traders, whose most prosperous leaders and vocal rhetoricians combined religious revival and modern interests in pleading the cause of the Sinhalese \"sons of the soil.'' Some members of the most famous of these Pettah merchant families—H. Don Carolis who dealt in furniture, N.S. Fernando, in stationery, and D.D. Pedris—were charged by the British with being implicated in the riots. Edmund Hewavitarana, son of Carolis and brother of Anagarika Dharmapala, died in jail in penal servitude after his death sentence was commuted; Pedris's only son was court­martialed and shot for inciting rioters to attack Muslim shops; and Fernando's son, Albert Wijesekera, who was also Pedris's son­in­law, had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment and died in jail shortly afterwards. 55 It is difficult to resist the conclusion that if one were to search for leaders behind the scenes who fanned the flames of the riots—and were perhaps even openly involved in pointing out rival businesses as targets—obvious candidates would be found among the Sinhalese Pettah merchants, whose Buddhist enthusiasms were interwoven with their economic interests and political aspirations. The ideologues and advisers of this rising class were the leaders of Buddhist revivalism and the Sinhalese national cultural renaissance, among them Anagarika Dharmapala, the novelist and newspaper editor Piyadasa Sirisena, and prominent monks such as Migettuvatte Gunananda and Hikkaduve Sumangala. Verses by Dharmapala depicting the Sinhalese as victims of foreign exploitation appeared in his paper Sinhala Bauddhaya, accompanied by a cartoon showing the helpless Sinhala in the grip of alien traders, moneylenders, and land grabbers. To get an idea of the rancor fueling Dharmapala's nostalgia for a lost, pristine Page 70 Buddhism and a vigorous, just, and noble ancient Sinhala civilization, one must, however, read the letter he wrote to the secretary of state for the colonies from Calcutta on June 15, 1915, demanding a Royal Commission on the causes of the riots and assailing the Muslims. 56 \"The present terrible destruction may be traced to economic causes,\" Dharmapala said, blaming the British for not observing the promises made in the 1815 treaty. A couple of pages later, however, he added, \"The causes are economic and spiritual.\" Noting that there had been looting of German shops in West Ham, Liverpool, and elsewhere in England, he said, \"What the German is to the Britisher that the Muhammedan is to the Sinhalese. He is alien to the Sinhalese by religion, race and language.\" He commended the Dutch for protecting the Javanese from aliens and asked for similar protection for, and discriminatory policy in favor of, the Sinhalese: \"Aliens without a history and sons of the soil with a history should not be judged by the same standards.\" Their heritage of \"communal laws\" and communal landholding had given the Sinhalese a \"religious democracy\" for twenty­two centuries, Dharmapala said, but it had not survived in the face of British colonialism, which had destroyed native industries and impoverished the Sinhala peasantry, whom it debased by traffic in liquor and even turned into plantation coolie labor. He lashed out at the Muslims as British­protected foreigners who were exploiting the vulnerable Sinhalese: The Muhammedans, an alien people who in the early part of the 19th century were common traders, by Shylockian methods became prosperous like the Jews. The Sinhalese, sons of the soil, whose ancestors for 2358 years had shed rivers of blood to keep the country from alien invaders . . . today they are in the eyes of the British only vagabonds. . . . The alien South Indian Muhammadan comes to Ceylon, sees the neglected, illiterate villagers, without any experience in trade, without any knowledge of any kind of technical industry, and isolated from the whole of Asia on account of his language, religion and race, and the result is that the Muhammadan thrives and the son of the soil goes to the walls.57 Kingsley de Silva gives an unvarnished summation of Dharmapala, which appears plausible: \"Dharmapala grasped as few of his contemporaries did the political implications of the Buddhist resurgence and he never lost sight of the need to set this latter within the wider framework of the rise of nationalism in Asia . . . his blending of religious fervor and national pride, of a sophisticated internationalism with a coarse insularity served as a model for the Buddhist activists of post­independence Sri Lanka.\"58 Page 71 There remains the issue of the culpability of the Sinhalese leaders of Buddhist temperance societies for inciting mobs against designated Muslim victims. 59 Although the temperance societies voiced criticism of certain imperial policies, there seems to be no good reason for the British to have imprisoned the leaders of these societies on the charge that they motivated or participated in the riots. Those imprisoned wrongly for a while included D. S. Senanayake, the future first prime minister of independent Sri Lanka; his brother, F. R. Senanayake, a vigorous nationalist, who died prematurely; and D. B. Jayatilaka, another important Sinhala Buddhist leader in the 1930s and early 1940s. As leaders of the Ceylon National Congress, formed in 1918, these men became constitutionalists, collaborating with the British in a plan for slow devolution of powers, and separated off from the slogans of the traditional cultural renaissance and political nationalist Buddhism flaunted by the likes of Dharmapala, Piyadasa Sirisena, and John de Silva (1857–1922). The last­named deserves special mention. As Jayawardena remarks, there was \"political content\" in de Silva's plays about heroic Sinhalese kings, Sri Wickrema Rajasinha and Duttugemunu, and in \"the provocative anti­British dialogue\" of his modern satire Sinhala Parabava Natya, which portrayed the decadence of the Sinhalese as a result of foreign influences.60 If Anagarika Dharmapala and Piyadasa Sirisena were the foremost ideologues of the Sinhalese nationalist revival, de Silva can be regarded \"the founder of the Sinhalese nationalist theatre,\" Sarath Amunugama observes.61 De Silva was born in the suburbs of Colombo into an affluent Goyigama­caste family with strong Buddhist connections. He was, however, educated at a Christian mission school (like Dharmapala) and later at the Colombo Academy. After teaching for a while, he entered the Colombo Law College and became an accredited proctor (the equivalent of a British solicitor). His true love was the theater, and he led the way in forging a new syncretic urban tradition of nurti plays compounded of elements taken from the folk tradition and from itinerant visiting Indian dramatic groups. In content and message, these plays either dramatized and glorified nationalist historical themes or as social criticism castigated the Westernized Sinhalese elite for forsaking traditional ways and aping the manners and customs of the British. (They also contain stereotyped slurs against Muslims, Tamils, and alien elements.) Sri Wickrema Rajasinha and Duttugemunu are examples of the first theme; Sinhala Parabava Natya, which deals with the decadence and downfall of an affluent Sinhalese family that has adopted a Western style of life, is a pro­temperance play in the second mode. Page 72 Although de Silva and his backers belonged to the Sinhala bourgeoisie, for whom the Buddhist revivalist nationalist movement was the high road to political prominence, the principal audience for his plays was drawn from the railway, harbor, and factory workers of Colombo. \"The main Sinhalese playhouses were located in the Pettah, Maradana and Slave Island, in close proximity to the working class districts,\" Amunugama notes. Plays were staged on Saturday nights when the workers were enjoying their weekend holiday. Special attention was paid to plays put on after pay days. \"Nurti\" plays were advertised at work places, where itinerant musical bands were paid to play snatches of the songs which had achieved popularity. De Silva's players were also drawn mostly from the working class. Among them were sailors, wine waiters, arrack sellers and harbor workers. And his plays included a couple of working class roles to which were assigned risque songs and rude comments slighting the ways of the upper classes. 62 Islamic Revivalism Unveiled Muslim sentiments and preoccupations in Ceylon in the nineteenth century have been studied by Vijay Samaraweera and Ameer Ali.63 Ali reminds us that 1915 was the first time that anti­Muslim riots had taken place in Ceylon, and that they were not simply precipitated by local disputes over processions in Matale and Kandy, or by the commercial practices of the Coast Moors. He also reminds us that not only the Coast Moors but all Muslims were potential victims, and that not only Muslim shops but numerous mosques too were destroyed. \"A total of 25 Muslims were murdered, 189 were wounded and at least four of their women raped. In addition 4075 Muslim shops were looted, 350 houses and 17 mosques were set ablaze, and another 86 mosques suffered some sort of structural damage,\" he notes.64 In monetary terms the damage was over 5.5 million rupees (Blackton puts the figure at 7 million), a very considerable sum in those days. The majority of the victims were Ceylon Muslims and not the Coast Moors. When the riots ended, four days after the imposition of martial law (they lasted for nine days in all), a total of 412 persons, mostly Sinhalese, were charged. Of these, 34 were sentenced to death, and the rest were given prison sentences of varying length. Paralleling the Buddhist revivalism spearheaded by Dharmapala and the Hindu Saiva­Siddanta reformism championed by Arumuga Navalar among the Ceylon Tamils, a heightened pan­Islamic consciousness was felt by all Muslims in Ceylon toward the end of the nineteenth century. Ali wonders whether the growth of the pan­Islamic sentiments did not contribute to the isolationism of Muslims in colonial Ceylon, and whether the heightening of Page 73 their collective identity through participation in an Islamic brand of revivalism and purification did not in fact raise an exclusivist and separatist image of the Muslims among the Sinhalese, who were at that same time in the grip of their own religious and nationalist and cultural revival. Islam, too, in Ceylon was moved to counter the aggressiveness and criticisms of a proselytizing Christianity and its missionaries. The lack of charismatic leadership among the Muslims of the kind represented by Dharmapala and Navalar was remedied by the arrival of the Egyptian political exile Arabi Pasha in 1883. There had been in the nineteenth century \"a continuous and intimate cultural flow between the Muslims of Ceylon and those who lived in South India via religious teachers (ulema) and schools (madrasas).\" Arabi Pasha was an ardent Egyptian nationalist, and his arrival stimulated the Muslims of Ceylon to establish direct cultural contact with the Middle East after an interval of centuries. 65 The new pan­Islamic sentiments found local enthusiasts in Siddi Lebbe and I. L. M. Abdul Azeez, who came under the direct influence of Arabi Pasha. Journals like the Muslim Necan and the Muslim Guardian, published in Ceylon between 1883 and 1915, showed increased interest in the affairs of Muslim countries. Muslims were invited and urged to subscribe funds for the construction of the Hejaz Railway, an Arabian project. The Ottoman sultan, Abdülhamid II, who was then also caliph of Islam, was adopted as a figure of veneration; and a special request was made by local enthusiasts like Azeez to the ulema to recite the sultan's name on Fridays at the congregational sermons in mosques. Finally the turukki topi, or fez, worn by the Egyptian exiles was adopted by many local Muslims as their \"national\" headgear; and a Muslim lawyer even won the right to wear a fez in the law courts in place of the traditional wig. Even after Abdülhamid was deposed by Kemal Atatürk and the Young Turks in 1909, the Ceylon Muslims continued to be interested in Turkish affairs. Since Turkey declared war on Britain and her allies in 1914, there was an air of plausibility to the rumors circulating at the time of the 1915 riots that the British wanted the Muslims to be punished and even removed from the island. Aside from pan­Islamic consciousness of this type, the Muslims of Ceylon were also exposed via South India to the kind of Islamic revivalism with puritanical and purificational tendencies represented by the fundamentalist Wahhabi movement, which spread through Muslim North India in the early part of the nineteenth century and began to have an impact on Muslims in the south in later decades.66 There the movement appears to have initiated attempts by some Tamil Muslims to rid themselves of \"non­ Page 74 Muslim accretions\" that had sullied Islamic orthodoxy. These included some neo­Hindu social observances and Tamil names, although attempts to replace the Tamil language with Urdu did not succeed. In fact, in Ceylon, Abdul Azeez, while in favor of discarding non­Islamic accretions, insisted that the ulema preach in Tamil, which the people could understand. Pan­Islamic trends and revivalism seem to have come to a head in the first decade of the twentieth century. The Muslim revivalist and reformist movement championed by Siddi Lebbe and Abdul Azeez also stimulated considerable progress in education among the Muslim community in Ceylon. Ali notes that \"the increase in the number of Muslim scholars in Government and Grant­in­Aid Schools from 1,663 in 1880 to 3,443 in 1901 and to 8,839 in 1915; the opening of the first Anglo­Mohammedan School . . . in 1884; the establishment of the Colombo Educational Society in 1891; the funding of Al­Madrasatul Zahira in 1892, which later emerged as Zahira College, the premier Muslim educational institution in Ceylon, were all the result of Muslim revivalism in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.\" 67 The South Indian Muslims who came to be known as the \"Coast Moors\" began to arrive in large numbers from the last quarter of the nineteenth century onwards, and as the carriers of Wahhabi­inspired fundamentalism and of their own \"fanatical\" religious practices, they were the first to come into collision with Sinhala Buddhists over the hoary issue of processions playing music passing mosques. Already in South India, the Madras suburb of Triplicane had become notorious for clashes on account of cow slaughter, beef consumption, and the rival processions of Hindus and of Muslims (especially the latter's Muharram processions to commemorate the martyrdom of Hassan and Hussain). Kayalpatnam, a Tamil­speaking Muslim village in the Tinnevelly District, had been active in the movement to rid Islam of neo­Hindu observances and non­Islamic accretions. It was these same Muslims, new migrants and settlers in Colombo and in many interior towns as traders and shopkeepers, who, as builders of their own mosques or as supporters of established ones, became confrontational (unlike the older, assimilated Muslims) over Buddhist processions playing music while passing their mosques. We thus return to our opening story. The Ambagamuwa Street mosque at Gampola and the Castle Hill Street mosque at Kandy that precipitated the riots in 1915 were built, run, and patronized by Indian Muslims. And these mosques now challenged the traditional routes taken by Buddhist processions, which in origin predated them. So rather than treating the Gampola and Kandy incidents as purely Page 75 \"local\" and \"parochial,\" it is necessary to see them as outcomes of a larger religious wave and enlarged pan­Muslim consciousness that had touched all the Muslims, and the Coast Moors in particular. The feeling that music was abominable (makruh), and that processions with blaring music were repugnant to orthodox Muslims, if originally pressed by the South Indian Moors, was soon adopted by other Muslims as well. \"The protests in the fall of 1902, in Hambantota in 1911 and in Balangoda in 1914 were raised almost entirely by the Ceylon Muslims and in the communal clash in Kurunegala they were also partly involved,\" Ali notes. 68 At a time when feelings of nationalism were running high within the majority community, the attempt by a local Muslim minority not to identify itself with the home country, to ally instead with another minority which was not only alien to Ceylon but also thought to be an economic encumbrance and above all to defend that minority's economic activities in the name of religious and racial connections was to invite the majority community to an open confrontation. It is therefore not surprising that the initial distinction which the Sinhalese made between the Indian and Ceylon Moors began to fade gradually and to disappear completely when violence broke out in 1915.69 The Scope of the Riots Once Colombo itself was affected, the rioting radiated to its environs, especially along the coast going north, engulfing Puttalam, Chilaw, and the Siyane Korale, but also rolling south, inundating Kalutara and then spreading all down the coast to Galle. A. P. Kannangara has traced the pathways of the spreading conflagration as follows: In the minds of many officials, though there were notable exceptions, the belief that the riots had been pre­arranged went together with the assumption that they had taken place simultaneously everywhere. But from the official reports themselves, as well as from other sources, it is possible to trace the spread of the riots from bazaar to bazaar along the railways and the main roads leading out of Kandy. . .and finally to Colombo. From Colombo the rioting spread along the Kelani valley as far as Ratnapura, and southwards along the coast as far as Matara, where it turned inland and went as far as Deniyaya. Along these main routes it also took to lesser roads where it proceeded at a slower pace, which accounts for the fact that bazaars along these roads were affected several days after the attacks on Muslims in the main centres had ceased.70 Four thousand and seventy­five Muslim shops were sacked and looted, 350 houses and 17 mosques were set ablaze, and another 86 mosques were damaged. The monetary value of damage was 5.5 million rupees to 7.5 mil­ Page 76 lion rupees. 71 According to one account at least 39 persons were killed by the rioters, and at least another 63 persons were killed by the military police in suppressing the riots. A second, probably more correct, records 140 deaths, the arrest of 8,786 persons and the imprisonment of 4,497. One account, relating to Muslim victims only, states that a total of 25 Muslims were murdered, 189 wounded, and at least 4 of their women raped.72 \"Looting was often a secondary motive,\" Kannangara says. \"The crowds which attacked the Muslim shops either set fire to the goods or threw them out on the road, from where other people often picked them up later.\" He cites a special commissioner, J. Devane, as remarking: \"In many places bonfires were lighted. The loot was publicly burned. This seems to show that many, at all events, of the villagers did not loot for the sake of pure loot. They looted as a kind of protest against some real or imaginary grievance.\"73 One stereotype can thus be laid to rest: the riots were not solely, or primarily, the work of criminals, vagabonds, and lumpen elements. The participants were clearly a cross­section of the urban and rural populations. But there is a lack of systematic information about the faces in the crowd. Although the riots began in Kandy, there seem to be no adequate descriptions of the social status of the participants there; the same applies to Gampola, where the dispute about processions passing mosques began. Both towns, being commercial centers, had shopkeepers of Sinhalese, Moor, and other origins. Both, being administrative and educational centers, would have had a range of government officials, clerks, teachers, and students. Both also had many Buddhist temples, with resident monks, and some mosques in the midst of Muslim enclaves. In Kandy itself, the Wesak perahera must have drawn crowds from both the town and its surrounding region. Thus what the assistant government agent reported of Pata and Uda Dumbara may plausibly have had a wider significance: looting, he said, was organized by \"priests, headmen, and notaries backed by school masters and low­country traders stirred to action by persistent rumors.\" Another official report (by Festing) said this of the Panadura­Kalutara belt, on the coast south of Colombo: \"Property owners manipulated the 'street leaders' who stirred the masses with stories of assaults on Sinhalese women and attacks on viharas.\" He also reports that \"most minor headmen were in it.\" However, the commissioner for Kalutara asserted that gangs radiated out from Colombo inciting local rural and urban populations to participate: \"Each village appears to have turned out en masse for the destruction of Moorish property in its vicinity and to have furnished a detachment to march with the nucleus of the rioters from such centers as Colombo and Siyane Korale East upon the next center to be attacked.\"74 Page 77 The police reported that the looting of Moor shops in Colombo was \"not the work of habitual criminals.\" Colombo's railway workers were the most likely leaders of the \"gangs\" that moved about the city and streaked out to the suburbs, attracting other inhabitants. They knew the strategic importance of using the railway as a mode of transport. Both the Kandy­Colombo railway line and other lines in the Western Province provided speedy transport for large numbers of rioters: \"The foci of disturbances on the 1st of June—viz. Colombo, Angulana, Veyangoda and Mirigama—point to the intimate relation between the railway and the riots,\" Jayawardena quotes from a report. 75 The tramcars in the Maradana­Borella­Pettah chain were likewise used by gangs. Kannangara's Thesis Kannangara argues, with considerable citation of the writings of British officials and other sources, that it was certain segments of \"the lower orders,\" to use a label from Rudé, or, to use Kannangara's label, \"poorer members of the subordinate \\[Sinhala\\] castes,\" who were especially susceptible to participation in the riots. These people were concentrated in villages near the urban centers, which had mushroomed as a result of the social, administrative, legal, and economic changes introduced by the British Raj and the construction of major road and railway networks primarily feeding a commercial sector focused on large capitalist plantations. \"New towns and townships had arisen and old ones had expanded, with law courts, police stations, government offices, lawyers' and notaries' offices, and densely populated bazaars containing a variety of shops, warehouses, artisans' workshops, taverns and so forth,\" Kannangara notes. The communities in the villages upon which these urban centres arose and those of the villages which stood nearby or along the main roads and railways were thus transformed. . . . Economic and other processes which were enriching some people were impoverishing others; the lands they held were being reduced, taken away altogether or their tenures made more precarious. . . . Among those who were thus deposited at the bottom of the social heap in urbanized areas there were, as already indicated, significant differences. . . . But what they all had in common was poverty and the struggle in insecure and often dangerous or demeaning occupations, in a new environment where they often felt the forces of the law as well as the social order itself weighing down upon them.76 Kannangara does suggest as a subtheme that some of the members of the newly mobile castes, such as the Duravas, Karavas, and Salagamas, may have felt resentment of the elite members of the Goyigama caste, espe­ Page 78 cially its superior headmen (mudaliyars), whom they could not contest frontally, and that they may have been prone to displace this caste resentment onto people of other races and religions. But it is really the poorer members of still lower castes, especially the Vahumpara and Batgama castes, that he singles out as the typical participants in the riots, \"partly because the incidence of landlessness was greater in these castes than in the dominant caste—partly perhaps because the traditional tenures on which the majority of cultivators belonging to these castes held land may have been weaker and therefore more vulnerable to the new economic conditions.\" 77 But there were other suggestive reasons why the Vahumpara and Batgama castes, which were the most numerous of the subordinate castes in the interior of the country, were predisposed \"to answer the call of race and religion in danger.\" In at least two of the anti­British uprisings with a markedly Buddhist colouring which took place in the Kandyan Provinces in the first half of the nineteenth century, including the major rebellion of 1848, the leaders who were alleged to have set up as pretenders to the Sinhalese throne were vahumpuras. . . . In 1848 proclamations were issued by the rebels alleging that the English queen intended to destroy the Dalada Maligawa, and that certain Kandyan headmen of the highest rank were traitors, some of them Christians and others of European blood. Vahumpuras from Peliyagoda and elsewhere were involved in considerable numbers in the clash which took place on Easter Sunday 1883 in Colombo. . . . On the day after this clash an armed crowd from Peliyagoda crossed the Kelani river into Colombo—as they had done in 1846 and were to do in 1915—with the evident intention of confronting the Catholics. Vahumpuras may have entered Colombo in 1883, and Colombo and Kandy in 1915, out of loyalty to rich fellow­members of their castes who were active Buddhists in the bazaars of these towns. But their traditions of religio­patriotic militancy probably carried as much weight with them. So also with the rioters from the batgama caste. This caste had traditionally been the soldiers of the Sinhalese kings. Their deference to goyigama headmen may have been weakening but not their memories of a martial past, which may indeed have been quickening in response to various changes in their social and economic position. It was these traditions no doubt as much as the call of the local village headmen of their caste which drove them at the beginning of the 1915 riots to set out from their villages and go to nearby towns.78 Many of those who were involved in the riots also stood low in the hierarchy of caste. They came from localities near the bazaars which were traditionally inhabited by concentrations of the subordinate castes. . . . Vahumpura men from Wanawahala and other villages around Peliyagoda, near Colombo, were present in Kandy on the eve of the riots. They had been got down, a shrewd observer suggested, by the organizers of the carol­procession in anticipation of trouble with the Muslims. . . . Men from the same caste and area were in the van of the crowds which, when the riots started in Colombo, tried Page 79 to enter the city. . . . An official reported seeing five hundred vahumpuras from Peliyagoda marching towards the Maradana junction with a Buddhist flag at their head. . . . In the Panadura bazaar the most prominent element in the crowds was formed by people from the village of Pinwatte, a considerable number of whose inhabitants belonged to those sections of the salagama caste which were traditionally its most disadvantaged and also most combative. 79 Kannangara suggests that those who had left their villages or saw their villages transformed by urbanization included workers in the graphite mines of the interior and in the railway workshops, municipal services, and graphite sheds of Colombo. Buddhist loyalties may have stirred these men to action when they were led to believe that temples, including the Dalada Maligawa, were about to be attacked by Coast Moors, whom they furthermore associated with the wartime increases in unemployment and food prices. Neither the temperance movement inaugurated in 1912 nor the Buddhist revivalists and budding politicians such D. S. Senanayake and D. B. Jayatilaka, who led it, were responsible for the outbreak or the course of the riots, he insists. The movement was not ''seditious\" in intent or a conspiracy against British colonial rule, as British officials believed when they overreacted and incarcerated many temperance workers and killed some of them. However, Kannangara also tries to argue that the ideas and prejudices and slogans of Buddhist revivalist activists and champions of a Buddhist \"nationalism,\" such as Dharmapala and Piyadasa Sirisena, and the propaganda they transmitted through newspapers, journals, the theater, and public speaking, did not integrally link up with the promotion and advancement of the interests of Buddhist businessmen. The Buddhist publicists, \"who understandably wished to further the interests of businessmen who financed them,\" had in mind \"to boost not the profits but the social prestige of their patrons, who were a relatively new group in Sinhalese society, drawn largely though not exclusively from the non­goyigama castes.\"80 Kannangara would like to mute the links between Buddhist revivalism and commercial interests to the extent that they imply any direct connection between the Buddhist merchants and antagonism to the Coast Moors and their economic success. But I have already cited other evidence as to why and how some of the prominent members of the newly successful and socially mobile Pettah merchant families could have fused their revivalist religious enthusiasm with a Sinhala nationalism that at this time spoke for the cultural and economic interests of the Sinhala people at large, many of them in precisely that deteriorating, déclassé condition that Kannangara so vividly describes as existing in or near the new bazaar towns.81 Moreover, it is significant that temperance leaders were encouraging local Page 80 temperance societies to improve the lot of the peasantry by establishing trading cooperatives, rural savings banks, and so on, and thereby to extricate the peasants from debt, poverty, and the clutches of traders. Kannangara's attempt to dissociate the 1915 riots from the larger religio­political context, and from any organized direction both before and after the riots broke out, leaves us perilously close to the theory that the riots broke out \"spontaneously\" and spread simply by \"contagion,\" unaided by design or organization. Kannangara suggests, however, that the crowds were assembled simply by the force of rumors that the Moors were coming to attack Sinhalese temples, interests, and people. Whether this is a sufficient explanation, readers must decide for themselves. Were the Riots Planned? After attempting to trace the evidence for the degree of planning and the identity of the organizers and perpetrators of the riots as far as possible, Michael Roberts comes down in favor of two hypotheses, between which he is unable to make a final choice. He posits a distinction between a \"national elite,\" composed of affluent individuals and families with nationwide prestige, power, and authority, and \"local elites\" whose members belonged to influential kindreds (pelantiyas). His first hypothesis is that \"common causal and background factors resulted in anti­Moorish communal riots which revealed some common patterns and which involved some uncoordinated preplanning on the part of either the national and/or the local elite.\" The second hypothesis, while positing ''common causal and background factors,\" rejects the idea that the riots were to any degree preplanned, but asserts that they show common patterns and \"threw up riot leaders who were, in part, associated with similar organizations \\[associations such as temperance societies\\] and were centred in the local elite.\" 82 What emerges from Roberts's documentation, which focuses mainly on the provinces and little on Colombo, is that segments of the \"local elite,\" local notables such as middle­ and lower­ranking headmen, and members of local associations (concerned with temperance and/or religious welfare) participated, led, or colluded in the riots. It is probably not very helpful to pose the question in either/or exclusionary terms as regards preplanning, the degree of coordination of mob attacks, and the degree of spontaneity of outbreaks, for at different sites, there were different combinations of features, predisposing circumstances, and contingent chain reactions. The riots were purposive and instrumental in their logic rather than simply or solely an expression of crowd mentality run amok in the context Page 81 of anomie, widespread hardship, or incidental provocation. The Coast Moors first, and the Muslims at large, were purposely targeted, and the crowds knew what they were about when they attacked their shops and their mosques. But the behavior and energies of riot crowds are not exhausted by considerations of design, prior purposes, or prearrangement. When the Wesak merit­making activities, carols, and processions in Kandy were frustrated and challenged, it was in the cards that they would be transformed into attacks on Muslim establishments, as the police realized and as A. G. Fraser has stated. But the collective excitement and frayed tempers of the moment dictated the timing and the details of the attacks. Two concepts that may be employed to describe the trajectory of such riots are focalization and transvaluation. These are linked processes by which a series of local incidents and small­scale disputes, occasioned by religious, commercial, interfamilial, or other issues, and involving people in direct contact with one another, cumulatively build up into larger and larger clashes between growing numbers of antagonists only indirectly involved in the original disputes. This progressive involvement of the ethnic public coincides with their coming under the sway of the rhetoric of propagandists and the horror tales of rumormongers, who appeal to larger, deeper, certainly more emotive and enduring—and therefore less local—context­bound—loyalties and cleavages, such as race, religion, language, nation, or place of origin. To sum up: focalization progressively denudes local incidents and disputes of their contextual particulars, and transvaluation distorts, abstracts, and aggregates those incidents into larger collective issues of national or ethnic interest. The case studies that follow confirm and elaborate the relevance of the processes of focalization and transvaluation, and others that will be identified. Page 82 4 Two Postindependence Ethnic Riots in Sri Lanka Between 1948, the year Sri Lanka achieved independence, and 1983, there have been some seven occurrences of mass violence unleashed by segments of the majority Sinhalese, who constitute 74 percent of the population, against the Tamil minority, who make up about 18 percent. The Tamils are subdivided into Sri Lankan Tamils (12.6 percent) and Indian Tamils (5.6 percent), but both groups have from time to time been victims of violence initiated by Sinhalese and have sometimes responded in kind. The most significant of these riots took place in 1956, 1958, 1 1977, 1981, and 1983. In this chapter, I shall briefly deal with the first and last of the series: the riots that took place in 1956 are significant because they signaled the stirrings of the first postindependence conflict fueled by issues of official language and land­settlement policy as they affected ethnic group interests; the riots of 1983 are notable as the most violent and extensive of the occurrences, and they figure in the context of the early stages of the conflict that was escalating into a civil war between the armed forces of the state, dominated by the Sinhalese, and the Tamil insurgents, who had resorted to armed retaliation. The 1983 riots are also distinctive as the last instance so far of collective civilian violence; the ethnic conflict has since then developed into warfare between the armed forces and the insurgents, with the civilian population caught in between. 1956: The First Eruption My own firsthand and indelible experience of ethnic riots happened in June 1956, when as a twenty­seven­year­old social scientist, recently returned from graduate studies in the United States, I took a team of thirty­three students (twenty­six Sinhalese and seven Tamils) to conduct a sur­ Page 83 vey of some newly settled peasant colonies in Gal Oya Valley. 2 The Gal Oya Multipurpose Scheme was Sri Lanka's first and largest postindependence development project, whose tasks were flood control, provision of irrigation for cultivating the \"maximum acreage of land possible,\" and generation of electricity for domestic and industrial use. The Gal Oya Development Board, appointed by the Sri Lankan government in 1949, was modeled on the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Damodar Valley Corporation, but was actually more circumscribed in its structure and powers than these two giant corporations. The largest component of the board's agricultural plan was the settlement of landless peasants from depressed villages with families and some agricultural experience on small paddy and highland allotments. (Provision was also made for larger­scale cultivation, marketing, and processing of cash crops by cooperative agricultural and industrial undertakings.) From 1950 to 1958, about 43 village units were created in what was referred to as the Left Bank, where most of the settlement had thus far taken place. The total number of colonists given allotments of land was 5,859. Of these, about 50 percent came from the board's \"area of authority\" in the Eastern Province, consisting of local Muslims and Tamils from the east coast and Sinhalese or Sinhalized Veddahs from the interior jungle villages, who had been displaced by the dam and reservoir. The next major group consisted of \"Kandyan\" Sinhalese villagers from the Central Province (25 percent), the majority coming from the Kandy and Kegalle districts. The remaining 25 percent came from other areas, such as the Southern (8 percent), Western, and Sabaragamuva provinces, and they were all Sinhalese. Although the colonists were ethnically mixed, the Sinhalese colonists were spatially separated from the local east coast Tamils and Muslims. The former were settled on the favored upper reaches of the Left Bank, immediately below the dam, and the latter were allotted less well irrigated lands at the ends of the irrigation channels contiguous with their original settlements. A phalanx of officials, bureaucrats, and experts running the development program were locally housed in comfortable government­built bungalows in the administrative center, the fast­growing boomtown of Amparai, which was also the locus of a bustling bazaar of shops and of the rooming houses and shacks that accommodated hundreds of construction workers and transport personnel (who, if married, had left their spouses and families behind), as well as casual laborers and other young men in search of employment or making a living because the local mudalalis (small businessmen) and other traders needed their muscle. Page 84 The Gal Oya scheme was located some 150 miles by road from Colombo, the island's capital, in a region that had previously been a jungle sparsely populated by slash­and­burn cultivators. By Sri Lankan reckoning in 1956, it was situated in the deep interior, and it was relatively inaccessible because of poor roads and transport facilities. Except for telephone and radio communications, available primarily to the elite officials and administrative offices, the valley had the air of being sealed off. The residents irregularly got news via the Colombo newspapers and from bus and truck drivers, traveling traders, and passengers in transit. The 1956 riots—which, as we know now, were only the first and smallest in a series of Sinhala­Tamil civilian clashes from that time to the most recent in 1983—were the first ethnic riots in the island after Sri Lanka attained independence. There was a long gap of forty­one years separating these riots from the riots of 1915 between the Sinhalese and Muslims (discussed at length in chapter 3). Although the last decades of British rule and the early years of independence since 1948 had seen labor disputes and trade union strikes, thuggery at elections, and other disturbances of the public peace (ranging from vendettas between traders and merchants and their respective retinues to armed robbery and homicide), there was nothing that in scale, explosiveness, and novelty matched the 1956 eruption (for 1925 was by then only a memory trace). 3 Prior to the 1956 riots, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike had been under mounting pressure from his own Sri Lanka Freedom Party to bring in a \"Sinhala Only Bill,\" and it had been announced that such a bill would be introduced. Bandaranaike had said that provisions for the \"reasonable use of Tamil\" would come later, but he had also in his speeches maintained that unless a \"Sinhalese only\" policy were adopted, the Sinhalese \"race, religion and culture would vanish.''4 From the point of view of Tamils, certain ominous events that accompanied this projected legislation foreshadowed worse to come. In the same year, the government announced that the leading teacher training college in the country would be reserved for Sinhalese teachers only. Around the same time, the Eksath Bhikkhu Peramuna (United Front of the Monks) demanded that persons educated in English or Tamil be prevented from taking public examinations until the year 1967. The Federal Party, whose leader was S. J. V. Chelvanayagam, had made a strong showing in the elections of 1956, especially in the north, emerging as the dominant Tamil party. This result was in strong contrast to its poor showing in the 1952 elections. Its mounting success among the Tamils was because it advocated that the Tamil language should have \"parity status\" Page 85 with Sinhalese. What distinguished the Federal Party from other Tamil political parties, besides its advocacy of a federal constitution, was its launching of a campaign of noncooperation and civil disobedience along the lines of Gandhian satyagraha to exert pressure on the government. The most effective of these civil protests was staged in June 1956. The Official Language (or \"Sinhala Only\") Bill, specifying that Sinhala would henceforth replace English as Sri Lanka's official language, was introduced on June 5, and the Bandaranaike­led MEP government passed it on June 14, 1956, by a vote of 56 to 29. 5 The debating of the bill caused a buildup of tensions on both sides and the eruption of violence. James Manor notes: Federal Party Leaders had whipped up feeling against the bill for weeks and on 5 June, the day that it would be introduced in Parliament, a complete \"hartal\" (suspension of normal business) was held in the Tamil­majority areas. The day before Chelvanayagam had written to Bandaranaike, \"members of Parliament belonging to our party will lead a batch of about 200 satyagrahis to sit on the steps of the western entrance to the House of Representatives and there they will remain fasting the whole day. . . . I write to you asking you for your cooperation . . . to ensure that the satyagrahis are not disturbed.\"6 On June 5, the Tamil satyagrahis, who had been refused entry to Parliament, which had been cordoned off with fences and was guarded by policemen, staged a sit­ down demonstration nearby, and this led to their forcible ejection and signaled the riot. Some 200 Tamil protesters, including leading politicians, took part in this satyagraha rally on Galle Face Green. A crowd of Sinhalese collected, and several Tamil leaders and volunteers participating were physically injured and had to be taken to hospital.7 Meanwhile, small bands of Sinhalese roamed through the city, looting shops and destroying a few vehicles. The next morning, more serious looting was perpetrated in the Pettah shopping zone. The official estimates of damage done during two days was 87 injuries to persons and 43 lootings of shops. Some 113 people were arrested. The Tamil sit­down demonstration \"led to bitter riots in which over 100 people were injured. In a few days, they had spread to Eastern Province, where Tamils and Sinhalese lived intermingled; in Batticaloa and the Gal Oya Valley there was such violence that between 20 and 200 persons were killed, depending on which side was doing the tallying,\" according to W. Howard Wriggins.8 \"Sinhalese toughs—inspired as always by fantastic rumors—seized government cars, bulldozers and high explosives and for a few days terrorized the Tamil minority in the colony,\" Manor writes. \"Scores of Tamils, certainly well over one hundred, were massacred and Page 86 hundreds more were driven into hiding. The army was sent to quell disturbances.\" 9 In Batticaloa, a mass demonstration by about ten thousand Tamils was fired on by the police, resulting in at least two deaths. In the Gal Oya Valley, violence on a scale hitherto unknown broke out some five days after the turmoil in Colombo, setting a precedent for even more destructive violence two years later. If one wonders what the relationship between the official language controversy and ethnic violence in the Eastern Province might be, why the rioting leapt from urban Colombo on the west coast to Gal Oya, a bustling enclave of hectic development activity and peasant resettlement, the answer is that around this time, the language issue was also becoming interwoven with the government's policy of peasant resettlement in the less populous parts of the island. Just as the first issue had implications for the educational and employment prospects of the Tamils, so the second would be construed as causing demographic changes in Sinhalese and Tamil (and Muslim) ethnic ratios in the Eastern Province, and therefore as bearing on the politics of territorial control and of \"homelands.\" In fact, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Federal Party in December 1949, its leader, Chelvanayagam, had warned that the government's colonization policy, whose beginning was evidenced by the Gal Oya Scheme, was even more dangerous to the Tamil people than the Sinhala­language policy. \"There is evidence\" he said, \"that the government intends planting a Sinhalese population in this purely Tamil­speaking area.\"10 Like the officials and colonists we were interacting with in Gal Oya Valley, my students and I had virtually no intimation of the events taking place in Colombo, or any inkling of the explosion about to happen in our midst. After finding ourselves trapped in Amparai, we were quickly shipped out by the Gal Oya authorities as soon as the violence showed signs of subsiding. Upon my return to the campus at Peradeniya, the vice­chancellor of the university, Sir Nicholas Atygalle, requested that I write him a report on the happenings of Gal Oya as soon as I could, including if possible statements by students who were contactable—this was the period of the long vacation—because the riots in question were a new phenomenon and many people were uncertain as to what to make of them. I submitted a speedily composed memorandum (together with statements by some of the students) to Sir Nicholas. A few years later, in 1960, I left Sri Lanka, and in the course of several changes of residence and workplace in three countries, Thailand, England, and the United States, I managed to lose my copy of the memorandum. In 1992, to my thankful surprise, Professor Kingsley de Silva of Peradeniya University sent me a copy Page 87 of the document, which he had received from another professor, who had come across it in the university's archives. The student reports were not retrieved. I have decided to reproduce my 1956 memorandum here with minimal changes, despite some interpretive shortcomings. One of its virtues in its pristine state is that it quite self­consciously conveys that the \"narrative\" was constructed out of various kinds of fragments—my own encounters and conversations, reports from students, newspaper accounts, reports of reports, and so on—which were arranged to provide a connected story. The authorial work is transparent. A second virtue is that the narrative singled out themes such as the central role of rumors in triggering the violence and also in generating anger and panic among the participants, the slowness to action of the police (themselves drawn from the majority community), and the critical faces in the crowd—in this case, the mobile and volatile labor force and construction workers who unleashed the violence. More than three decades later, when I began my comparative study of riots, I would find these themes to be of recurring import. Some obvious prejudices about \"the criminal classes\" expressed in this text have been allowed to stand, since a text written many years ago is being reproduced. 11 The third significance of this report, which is not underscored in the original writing, because it was taken not to be unusual for those times at the university, is that a lecturer of Tamil ethnic origins was able to lead a team of students, the vast majority of whom were of Sinhalese ethnic origin, to Gal Oya for sociological research. Moreover, it is a mark of the tolerance, friendship, and mutual trust of those times that when the riots broke out, the Sinhalese students took good care to protect me and the seven other Tamils in the team from any possible victimization. The university campuses are much different today. THE GAL OYA RIOTS: A REPORT FROM A YOUNG ACADEMIC TO HIS VICE­CHANCELLOR In writing about the Gal Oya riots, it would not be possible to give a meaningful and chronological account of the happenings if one were to confine oneself to only what one saw with one's own eyes. I am taking the liberty of presenting an account based on direct knowledge as well as indirect information elicited from persons. However I shall carefully specify and differentiate between statements based on events witnessed by me and statements based on accounts given by others in the valley at the time of the riots. Care will be taken to state the sources of the facts narrated. The Gal Oya disturbance cannot of course be treated as an isolated phenomenon. It must be viewed in the general context of communal tensions Page 88 and political differences existing in the country and also as a continuation of disturbances that started in Colombo during and after June fifth. The account given here however deals only with incidents that happened in the Eastern Province. The trouble started in the Gal Oya Valley itself on June 11 at Amparai. I remained in the valley for four days (June 11–14) and was evacuated to Batticaloa on the night of June 14. The events related here are those that happened during those four days; however, certain events in the Eastern Province that happened before the eleventh will be referred to to provide the necessary background. EVENTS IN GAL OYA AND THE EASTERN PROVINCE PRIOR TO THE 11TH THAT HAVE A BEARING ON THE RIOTS 1. The setting fire to a Sinhalese shop in Batticaloa: a Sinhalese person inside the shop shot with a gun three Tamil persons in the crowd that had gathered to watch the fire (newspaper account). 2. Subsequently, the Tamils in Karativu on the Batticaloa­Amparai road stoned Gal Oya Board trucks. On the ninth I saw in Amparai town three trucks which had damaged windshields caused by stone throwing. 3. In Gal Oya Valley itself, the Danish Equipment Company engaged in construction work had labor trouble. From officials I gathered that they were on strike and that their work was discontinued (hearsay). Comment. These Events Indicate That: (a) Communal tensions (Sinhalese versus Tamil) had by now spread to the Eastern Province. (b) Because the main supply route to Gal Oya was the Batticaloa­Amparai road, and because there were large numbers of Tamils concentrated in Batticaloa and in the colonized areas of the valley, and a large number of Sinhalese in the Gal Oya Valley, what takes place in Batticaloa and its hinterland would have repercussion in the Valley and vice versa. (c) Because of labor trouble, there were certain elements in the Valley who would prove dangerous during riots. THE FIRST DAY OF THE RIOTS—MONDAY, JUNE 11 The Attack on the Tamils in Amparai At about 2 P.M. the University team left the hospital where they were housed to do field work in the colonized areas. The team was divided into two groups: (a) about 26 Sinhalese students travelling in a converted lorry and working in Unit 32, and (b) about seven Tamil students travelling in a land rover and conducting investigations in Unit 14. On this particular day I went along with group (b), and returned to the hospital with them at about 10 o'clock in the night, when students came rushing to me and informed me about the communal clashes that took place that evening. Leslie Gunasekere, who was in charge of team (a) on the eleventh, reported that at about 8:30 P.M. when their bus was returning from Page 89 the field, it was stopped by a mob who asked whether there were Tamils in the bus. On being told there were none, they were allowed to proceed (see Leslie Gunasekere's account). Immediately they returned home the Sinhalese students fearing that their Tamil friends in the team who had gone separately were in danger, formed in groups and stationed themselves at points on various roads to warn us of the danger. One such group of students who scouted the Amparai­Uhana road witnessed a mob setting fire to a canteen run by a Tamil (see P. N. M. Fernando's and A. Andarawewa's and T. D. J. Vitharana's accounts). Another group of three students reported that in the evening while they were having tea at Miranda's (a restaurant and store run by Indian Tamils), a mob gathered outside and stoned the place (see M. L. Wijesekera's and Manopala's accounts of incident). That night victims of physical assault by the mob were brought to the hospital for medical attention. Because the doctor was short of staff, the university students lent a helping hand. I personally saw four victims—all of them were Tamils and two were dangerously clubbed on their skulls. The Rumor of the Raped Telephone Operator The next morning (Tuesday) I was told by various persons about the incidents of the previous afternoon. Karunaratne and Podisingho (drivers of the land rover and lorry detailed for our use) said that on Monday afternoon one of the truck drivers whose vehicle had been stoned by Tamils on the Batticaloa­Amparai road, had come to Amparai and propagated the story that a Sinhalese telephone operator (girl) in Batticaloa had been raped and stripped and sent naked along the streets. (This story was later pronounced as untrue by the police and Government Agent—Newspaper account.) This rumor believed by the common people in Amparai inflamed their passions against the Tamils—hence the retaliations. Throughout the riots havoc and panic were created by rumors and in trying to understand the violence one must bear in mind that rumors of atrocities done by one group against the other created panic and fear in the people thus inciting them to retaliatory acts. The rumor of the raped girl is the first of the series. On Tuesday morning Mr. Kuruthumpala (the Senior Statistical and Public Relations Officer) told me about the incident at the Chinese Cafe the previous night. Some of the Board Officials including Mr. Kuruthumpala—all members of the Y.M.C.A.—were celebrating at the Chinese Cafe. According to him, a mob collected outside and demanded that the Tamil officials and their wives inside be delivered to them, and that the Sinhalese officials refused to do so. Podisingho (driver of our lorry) told me that three Tamil ladies inside the cafe were stealthily taken through the back of the cafe to safety. According to Mr. Kuruthumpala, when he emerged out of the cafe he was assaulted by the mob, and the cars of the officials were stoned. I also met Mr. Wirasekera (Assistant Commissioner of Local Government) on Tuesday morning, and he said that the mob entered his house, where Mr. Rajavarothiam also lived, assaulted the latter and stole some goods. In general, the assaults on Monday night were against Tamils in Amparai and less frequently against Sinhalese officials who protected Tamil officials. Page 90 In discussing the happenings on Monday with various persons I was told that the mob was spearheaded by irrigation and construction workers and truck drivers, etc., living in Amparai and nearby construction sites such as Pallang Oya. I also got the impression that the police made no attempt to prevent the assaults and looting, and that they had looked on. The police force at Amparai and in the Valley was woefully small, but it appears that officers did not intervene where they were actually present at scenes of assault and looting. I must emphasize that this statement is hearsay. THE SECOND DAY—TUESDAY, JUNE 12 On Tuesday morning the Acting Resident Manager, Mr. Abeyawardene, phoned me that because of the previous day's troubles we should not go out into the field, and he requested me to come to the Circuit Bungalow. (This is the house in which top officials of the Board and other members of the Government reside during their periodic visits from Colombo.) I went there at about 10 A.M. and found the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Kanagasundram, and the other top officials conferring with persons who I was told were the ring leaders and spokesmen of the Amparai workers. From the conference proceedings that I overheard, I gathered that the latter were demanding that about 50 odd families of Sinhalese workers in Amparai were residing in Batticaloa and that the women and children there were in danger of attack by Tamils, and that therefore they should be transported from Batticaloa to Amparai. I heard the Chairman telephone the Government Agent, Batticaloa, and making arrangements with him for the transportation of the families. Soon afterwards I left for the hospital. The Siege of the Circuit Bungalow In the evening started the siege of the Circuit Bungalow. After the previous day's incidents in Amparai, I gathered that the Tamils in Amparai had gone to the police station and to the Circuit Bungalow to seek refuge. By the evening therefore the Circuit Bungalow was full of Tamils. This site had also become the headquarters of the officials who were dealing with the riots. Therefore it was a strategic place. I have already referred to the chairman's agreement to transport the Sinhalese families from Batticaloa to Amparai. I gathered that the actual transportation was delayed, for what reasons I am not sure. By evening, a large mob had encircled the Circuit Bungalow which was under police protection. From Father Wickramanayake (who subsequently gave evidence to the Magistrate with regard to the shooting at the Circuit Bungalow) and Mr. Gooneratne (Agricultural Officer, Extension) I gathered that the police had used tear gas to disperse the mob but were unsuccessful. Then when the mob tried to stop a jeep bringing a bren gun and assaulted the driver, the police opened fire. One man was shot dead through the bowels, another shot through the shoulder (he subsequently died) and the third was shot in the arm. All three were Sinhalese. Then the mob cut off the electricity and water supply to the bungalow, and a group broke into a dynamite dump at Inginiyagala and stole dynamite with the intention of blowing up the bungalow. Fortunately Page 91 they could not lay hands on the detonators. The military arrived about 11 P.M. and with their arrival the mob dispersed. Early in the morning (3:30 A.M.) the mob set fire to Miranda's restaurant, and I saw the fire from the hospital. THE THIRD DAY—WEDNESDAY, JUNE 13 On Wednesday morning I gathered that the Tamil refugees in Amparai were sent under escort to Batticaloa that morning. I had repeatedly gotten in touch with the authorities requesting transport for us to get out of the valley, but they said they were unable to do so. On Wednesday morning at about 10:30 A.M. I went to the Amparai Police Station to make further requests. At about 11:30 A.M. when I was about to return to the hospital a lorry arrived with Sinhalese refugees from Bakiela, who said that they had been attacked by Tamil Colonists. The Mythical Tamil Army By noon, started the biggest scare which caused pandemonium in Amparai. The rumor spread like wildfire that a Tamil army, 6,000 strong, armed with guns and other weapons were approaching Amparai, having laid waste Uhana, and killed women and children there. Neither the Police nor the Army were able to counter in time this rumor or check its veracity. The panic was so great that a mass evacuation and flight of persons from Amparai took place. The Seizure of Vehicles and Flight from Amparai Many of the looters and rioters went to the workshop, took over the vehicles—lorries, mandators, euclids, etc. Some of the vehicles filled with armed men and carrying dynamite went to meet the mythical army which was supposed to be advancing. The others packed with men, women and children evacuated the valley through the Inginiyagala­ Moneragala road. (From newspaper accounts we know the subsequent history of these escaping vehicles—many of them were seized by the police all over the country, and some of the looters caused trouble all along the coastal route of the Southern and Western Provinces.) Fighting Spreads to Colonized Areas As mentioned before, many rioters got into vehicles and went into the colonized areas. At the same time, the Tamil colonists had taken the offensive in retaliation. That is to say that on the third day the fighting had spread to the colonized areas which had hitherto been peaceful. The marauding gangs in vehicles looted and attacked the colonized areas. The Tamil colonists retreating to their parent villages returned in large numbers armed with guns. Pitched battles began to take place in Bakiela, Vellai Valli, Village Units 11, 16, 14, etc. In Amparai town the Cooperative Stores were looted. (See A. S. Jayawardene's account of men in vehicles on the rampage and the injured man brought to hospital in a mandator.) With this turn of events the Sinhalese colonists now found themselves in great danger and started to flee in the direction of Amparai. On Wednesday Page 92 night, four Tamil students and I slept in the Circuit Bungalow, which was chockful of Sinhalese colonists seeking refuge there. The Flight of the Officials Another paralyzing effect of the panic created by the myth of the murderous Tamil army advancing on Amparai was the flight of many of the Board Officials from the valley. I gathered that many of them left the valley in the Board's landrovers. Thus after the evacuation of the Tamil officials and the flight of most of the Sinhalese officials, the civil administration was literally reduced to a handful of remaining officials. THE FOURTH DAY—THURSDAY, JUNE 14 On the fourth morning I was present at the Circuit Bungalow where a conference between the police and all remaining board officers was held. The bungalow grounds were swarming with Sinhalese refugees from the colonized areas. Since an armed escort was leaving for Batticaloa I was able to send away the Tamil students. In the afternoon the Sinhalese students were removed to the Technical Training Institute. They left for Badulla in a mandator the next day, and from there returned to their homes by trains. Batticaloa became the scene of a reverse scare and rumor. The G.A.'s bungalow was mobbed by many residents of Batticaloa who said that a Sinhalese army from Amparai, armed and in possession of dynamite and travelling in Board vehicles was going to attack the town. They requested the G.A. to issue them with rifles and to give them permission to blow up the bridges. The basis of this scare was the fact that earlier in the day a marauding party from the valley was sighted 10 miles from Batticaloa. No army invaded Batticaloa that night. ON THE BREAKDOWN OF THE ADMINISTRATION Various press reports and statements by politicians refer to the breakdown of the Administration, implying that the riots were not handled properly by the officials. Such an allegation is a difficult one to examine, and the reader should take these comments as being purely personal. The question arises whether the Board could have foreseen the riots, the atrocities and mob passions. Did the government foresee the Colombo riots? Should the Board have anticipated riots in the Valley, after what happened in Colombo a few days previously? When the riots started the civil administration lost control, but then no civil administration of officials is competent to deal with this kind of sudden violence. A civil administration is ultimately dependant on the police force to maintain law and order and meet violence with force. The police force in Amparai was unpardonably inefficient on the first night. A show of force and might might have made a difference, as vigorous action in Colombo demonstrated, and as the army's toughness in Gal Oya proved. But then, on the other hand, the police force in the valley was pitifully small and understandably fearful of intervening against hundreds banded into mobs. Page 93 Regarding the flight of the officials, it is objectively true that many officials deserted their posts. The Tamil officials were evacuated from Amparai and many of the Sinhalese officials had left by the third day. Anyone who had been in the valley would understand the terror aroused in many and the havoc created by panic. He would be a brave man who was willing to endanger his life and the lives of his wife and children for the sake of national interest. To my mind the question arises as to under what conditions must a civil officer stick by his post. Must a civil officer stick to it if he has reason to believe that his life is in danger? It could be argued that where there is no security of life, there ends occupational responsibility. Whether the flight of the officials was understandable or reprehensible, the fact is that their flight in a sense paralyzed the administration, for they themselves were the administration. Their flight meant that there was no possibility of a volunteer force being organized, and a serious lack of persons for organizing refugee work. One serious error committed by both civil officers and the military was their failure to demobilize the vehicles in the workshop. The fighting spread to the colonized areas because rioters were able to seize vehicles and travel in them. Marauding gangs were dangerously hostile and difficult to seize once they were in possession of vehicles which enabled them to move and operate in a large geographical area. The failure to demobilize the vehicles would seem to be an administrative mistake and an error of strategy. The Gal Oya flareup is a superb study of rumor—the panic it creates and its magnification as it passes on from person to person. It is true that neither the civil nor military and police agencies were able to make an effective and timely denial of these rumors and to pacify the terror stricken people. It is of course debatable whether panic stricken and therefore at that moment irrational people would believe official denials, when in this country official denials are based on questionable veracity. Furthermore it is necessary to remember that a rumor to be denied must first be investigated and proven false, and this involves time; the time gap may be necessary but at the same time fatal as we have witnessed in Gal Oya on the third day when the rumor circulated that a Tamil army was advancing. I would like to convey to the reader my own feeling that a more constructive approach to the riots is not to try and see the rights and wrongs but to first understand the phenomenon of civil strife. The rumors and their consequences clearly portrayed that in times of civil strife normal methods of communication are useless and the assumption of a reasonable man unreal. Furthermore, whereas the civil officials are usually not trained to cope with riots, the military and police, though presumably trained in war and defense, were for the first time engaged in actual warfare, and therefore where there is no experience it might be too much to expect precision and speed in action. I have already referred to the probability that the rioting, assaults and looting were spearheaded by irrigation and construction workers and that subsequently the truck drivers joined in the fray. It is also suspected that a lot of I.R.C.s (Island Reconvicted Criminals) had found their way into the valley. The former persons if not criminal in background were criminally inclined during the riots. They might not have been directly concerned with the Page 94 language issue, but the political issue and the wave of emotionalism prevailing in the country provided the opportunity and context for these elements to exploit the situation. The recent Colombo riots and the Riots of 1915 showed that civil unrest could be exploited by criminal elements. Furthermore it is very plausible that irrigation and construction workers and truck drivers have a special stamp and possibly a special psychological make up. In the valley, unlike the colonists who are a permanent population, they are transient and move with their mobile jobs. They are footloose, used to working in jungles, cut off from normal family relationships, and therefore prone to violence. Amparai is an explosive town because it is very much like the boom town of the American West. Under these circumstances, foresight demands that these workers be carefully screened and selected. I am not aware of the system of selection practiced by the Board, but a more scrupulous system is recommended. Also, in the presence of such an inflammable population it is strange that a better policing system and a larger police force was not stationed in Gal Oya. Better police action at the initial stages would possibly have squashed the rising or at least mitigated its worst features. Lastly, the riots demonstrated in sharp relief the geographical isolation of the valley and the paucity of roads leading in and out of it. The difficulty of rushing in police and army reinforcements was a grave problem. Since the major road is from Batticaloa through Kalmunai, which is a Tamil area, there was no possibility of sealing off and isolating the Tamil and Sinhalese areas during the earlier stages. Obviously several other roads leading into the valley and an air service are needed. Civil strife in a fringe area poorly fed with roads is naturally difficult to control. The Colombo Riots of 1983: A Synopsis The course of the Sinhalese riots against the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka in 1983 has been documented by me elsewhere. 12 Here let me summarize what we know of the locations at which the arson and violence took place and the kinds of participants—''the faces in the crowd.\" The 1983 riots began in Colombo on July 24 and lasted until August 5. They spread to other parts of the country from this point of origin, especially to the towns of Gampaha and Kalutara in the southwest; Kandy, Kegalle, Matale, Badulla, and Nuwara Eliya in the central tea plantation districts; and Trincomalee in the Eastern Province. Although the official death toll was about 470, it has been estimated that about 2,000–3,000 people were murdered, many of them in a brutal manner. Thousands were displaced from their homes, most of them ending up in about a dozen makeshift refugee camps. \"Within the city of Colombo almost a hundred thousand people, more than half the city's Tamil population, were displaced from their homes, and many never returned to their neighborhoods or to their workplaces. Outside the country, it was estimated that there were Page 95 about 175 thousand refugees and displaced persons.\" 13 In this account I shall limit myself to happenings in Colombo. One feature of these riots that I want to underscore is their actual beginning, which bears some resemblance to the inception of the Delhi riots of 1984, in that an incident of violent death had traumatic and emotionally heightening effects on a crowd and worked as a triggering event for acts of crowd violence, which escalated rapidly into large­scale, spreading ethnic riots. The conventional story is that the most proximate triggering event was the ambush of an army truck and the killing and mutilation of thirteen soldiers at Tirunelveli, a place in the heart of Sri Lankan Tamil territory in North Sri Lanka, which had been under the occupation of a Sinhalese army for some time. The ambush was the work of Tamil insurgents belonging to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). This was certainly a moment of escalation in the ethnic conflict. India had begun to supply the Tigers with the Claymore land mine as a way of enabling them better to withstand the Sri Lankan Army (overwhelmingly Sinhalese in composition). Although skirmishes had taken place before, never before had so many Sinhala soldiers been killed at once. On July 23, certain elements in the army decided to bring the corpses in their mangled state to Colombo at the central Kanatte cemetery in Borella before giving them a military burial. The preparations for the burial were complicated and plagued by adventitious and uncontrollable factors. One of the soldiers killed was a young second lieutenant, who had apparently been a popular student at Ananda College, a premier Buddhist school, located in Maradana. Many pupils of this school, together with their parents and teachers, gathered at the cemetery and awaited the arrival of the bodies. In the meantime, the plane transporting the bodies to Colombo from Jaffna was delayed, and the waiting crowd, increasing in size, also became increasingly restless. After arrival, the bodies were to be taken to a funerary home next to the cemetery for preparation, but the delay also caused the police and army troops who had gathered in numbers at Borella to become emotionally agitated. And, as might be expected, the Sinhala media added further fuel to the mounting grief and rage. (There are separate Sinhalese and Tamil newspapers, radio, and television channels in Sri Lanka.) In the end, the long delay in the arrival of the bodies at Ratmalana airport, the unruliness of the packed crowd at the cemetery, and the demand of the grief­stricken relatives of the dead that the bodies be handed to them so that they could conduct their own rites forced the authorities to cancel the official burial at Kanatte. The bodies were taken to army headquarters. Page 96 The crowd then erupted in spontaneous violence and surged into the streets. Reviewing the trajectory of the riots, it seems plausible to suggest that they went through two phases. The first phase began in the vicinity of the cemetery in Borella, more or less as an overflow of heightened emotions on the part of the crowd gathered there—the schoolboys, friends, and relatives of the dead, some of the security forces, plus some of the local populace in Borella. Soon after the mortuary rites, street thuggery, stopping of traffic, and physical attacks broke out in Borella, Thimbirigasyaya, Nugegoda, Wellawatte, and Bambalapitiya, and almost a whole day passed before the army and police were called upon to intervene. This first phase of violence lasted one day; it was only after a short lull that crowd violence resumed in a form that was decidedly more destructive and homicidal, showing firm evidence of planning and direction, the participation of certain politicians (especially from the ruling party) and government employees (minor staff, laborers, technicians), and the use of government vehicles and buses. A conspicuous feature of the 1983 riots was that the mob violence, especially in its second phase, was organized and for the most part purposive. The crowds came armed with weapons such as metal rods and knives and carrying gasoline, which was frequently confiscated from passing motor vehicles. Evidence of the rioters' prior intent and planning was the fact that they carried voter lists and the addresses of Tamil owners and occupants of houses, shops, industries, and other property. Moreover, the gangs frequently had access to transportation; they arrived mostly in government­owned trucks and buses or were dropped off at successive locations by the Colombo coastline trains. Affirmation of these incidents comes from a senior official in the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador T. D. S. A. Dissanayaka, who has written a detailed and graphic account of the rioting in Colombo and elsewhere. He writes: \"In the afternoon \\[of July 25\\] the violence took a different turn. There was organized violence by gangs which were obviously trained and who operated with military precision. Their targets were the economic bases of the Tamils in Colombo and their homes.\" 14 This kind of organized violence first occurred in Ratmalana, on the southern periphery of Colombo, which had the largest concentration of factories in Sri Lanka, and then it moved northwards into the city. It coincided with another organized operation: a train traveling from Galle was made to make unscheduled stops in Ratmalana, and then at each stop into the city, at Dehiwela, Wellawatte, and other places, \"squads were dis­ Page 97 charged. . . . They demonstrated remarkable skill in destroying homes. . . . Tamil homes were identified with pinpoint accuracy using electoral lists. In attacking shops, the trained squads responded to three commands in Sinhala: 'kada \\[break\\], adha \\[haul\\],' and 'gini \\[set fire\\].' \" 15 At this phase of the violence, there was little looting of property, only systematic destruction of Tamil property and the eradication of the alleged affluence. A well­informed friend of mine has pointed out to me that the \"liberalized economy\" introduced from 1977 onwards had opened up new commercial and business opportunities. Many shops selling imported and local goods had opened. New business premises and houses had been constructed in Colombo, and higher rents had become possible. At the same time, this had aggravated competition, and the riots gave some Sinhala businessmen an opportunity to wipe out their competitors, enabled some landlords to get rid of unwanted tenants, and so on. It has also been suggested that Cyril Mathew, the chauvinist minister of industries, was vociferous that Tamil businessmen in Colombo were working both sides of the street—collaborating with the government in Colombo and with the Tamil insurgents in Jaffna— and that they therefore deserved to be \"taught a lesson.\" Matthew's ministry was a repository of knowledge about businesses, including details of their locations and owners. Its employees also provided the manpower for the government union called the Jatika Sevaka Sangamaya, which was involved in punitive actions and thuggery. It was also the source for vehicles that were used for political purposes. In a retrospective look at the manner in which events unfolded, it is plausible to suggest that there was a deadly confluence of two separate but complementary streams. Certain segments of the government, particularly Minister Matthew and his agents and client cohorts, had gathered information and made plans for punitive action against the Tamils in Colombo, and the ambush and killing of the thirteen Sinhalese soldiers in the north and the subsequent events at the Kanatte cemetery afforded the occasion for the prepared pogrom. That the army authorities and the minister of defence handled the deaths of the soldiers and their mangled corpses in polythene bags in a manner that would, whether intended or not, inevitably excite the emotions of the Sinhalese public at large is made even more problematic by the fact that news of the army's retaliatory violence on July 24 in Tirunelveli and Kantharmadu (in Jaffna), which resulted in an estimated 50 to 70 Tamils being killed, was suppressed from the media, both newspapers and radio, which in the meantime transmitted the inflammatory news of the dead Sinhalese soldiers and the conveyance of their dismembered remains to Colombo. Page 98 Ambassador Dissanayaka, who, I presume, had access to official records by virtue of his high position, reports that by Monday, August 1, when the riots had virtually subsided, the following number of incidents had taken place in Sri Lanka overall: 471 deaths, 8,077 cases of arson, and 3,835 cases of looting. Colombo district topped the list with 227 deaths, 2,720 cases of arson, and 1,712 of looting; Kandy district suffered 31 deaths, 1,065 acts of arson, and 132 of looting. Other districts where much violence occurred were Badulla (52 deaths, 838 cases of arson, and 630 lootings), Matale (3 deaths, 1,131 acts of arson, and 838 lootings), Kegalle (24 deaths, 390 cases of arson, and 195 lootings). Leaving aside Colombo district, one may reasonably conclude from the location and demographic profile of the other districts, which are mostly located \"up­country,\" where tea plantations and the towns servicing them are located, that not only Sri Lankan Tamil but also Indian Tamil business establishments, and the Indian Tamil labor working in the plantation sector were targeted. It may also be noted that Trincomalee district in the Eastern Province, in which there has been tension between the Sri Lankan Tamil residents and the allegedly newly arriving Sinhalese settlers, experienced 634 incidents of arson, and Jaffna district suffered 70 deaths, the second­largest number, primarily owing to the security forces taking punitive action against Tamil civilians as a sequel to the killing of 13 soldiers of the Sri Lankan Army in the north on July 23, 1983. The following is list of the locations and the kinds of property methodically burned, destroyed, and looted in Colombo: 1. Tamil houses in Colombo's middle­ and lower­class residential wards of Ratmalana, Wellawatte, Dehiwela, Bambalapitiya, and Kirillapone. 2. Tamil shops—groceries, textile shops, tea boutiques—lining Colombo's principal waterfront thoroughfare, especially in Bambalapitiya, and also in well­established residential and business zones such as Borella and Kotahena. In the densest shopping district, Pettah, Tamil shops and the shops of Indian merchants, principally selling cloth and wholesale foodstuffs, were targeted. Moreover, shops located in the city's newer and expanding residential areas such as Timbirigasyaya and Nugegoda were also affected. 3. Textile mills, garment factories, rubber­goods factories, and coconut­oil processing plants at Ratmalana, Grandpass, Ja­ela, and Peliyagoda, at the edges of the city, owned and managed by Tamil entrepreneurs and large businessmen. 16 4. The Indian Overseas Bank, the principal bank for Sri Lankans of Indian origin and Indian citizens in Sri Lanka. Page 99 The victims in Colombo were Tamil shopkeepers; Tamil homeowners, especially of the middle class and administrative/clerical/professional categories; Tamil large business capitalists and entrepreneurs, and Indian merchants, both Tamil and non­Tamil. These facts clearly indicate that the locations affected were central market and business zones, sites of new industrial development stimulated by the economic liberalization initiated by the new government of J. R. Jayewardene in 1977, and middle­class residential areas. There was practically no arson in slums and working­ class residential zones. At the most general level, the rioters on the Sinhalese side were all male and virtually all drawn from the urban population of Colombo and its suburbs. Those who actually committed murders, inflicted bodily harm, and engaged in arson, property destruction, and looting were typically drawn from the urban working class. A more detailed enumeration would include the following categories: wage workers in government and private factories and mills; transport workers, such as bus drivers and conductors, and workers in railroad yards and electrical installations; petty traders and market workers, including fish sellers and porters; small shopkeepers and salesmen in government corporations; hospital workers; high school students and the students of technical and tutorial institutes, including recent school leavers. The literacy explosion and the poor employment prospects of school graduates and leavers were potent factors in motivating the last category. Finally, there was the urban underclass of unemployed and underemployed shantytown dwellers. It would be a mistake to exclude from the list of participants those whose involvement was less visible but nonetheless crucial to the hatching, organization, and direction of the riots. Certain Sinhala politicians and their local agents, organized crime figures and smugglers, and small businessmen seeking to eliminate rivals were all involved in directing and manipulating the violence. Some of these might be described as \"riot captains\" who were experts at \"raising a mob\" (to use expressions current in England in the nineteenth century). In addition, some militant Buddhist monks played a role in inciting crowd action, sometimes as supportive witnesses and orators. Finally, it has been well attested that many members of the police force and security forces stood by during the 1983 riots—unwilling to restrain the rioters, showing sympathy for their actions, and in a few instances actively participating in the work of destruction. An intriguing question that some interpreters have grappled with is why, after a hiatus of some nineteen years since the last Sinhala­Tamil riots of 1958, a crop of riots of mounting violence should have occurred at Page 100 short intervals in 1977, 1981, and 1983. Since the last three upheavals took place on the watch of the United National Party, it has been asked to what extent the \"liberalized open economy\" and capitalist, market­oriented policies introduced by President Jayewardene created economic dislocations injurious to segments of the Sinhalese population, who might have sponsored, supported, and even participated in varying degrees in the spate of riots against the Tamils. The Tamils were targeted for a combination of reasons: they were perceived as privileged and a suitable object of redressive action on behalf of the majority Sinhalese population, especially its poorer segments; because they were convenient victims, against whom aggression that could not be directed at the state could be displaced; and because Tamil business interests could be dispossessed or eliminated to the advantage of Sinhalese small­scale entrepreneurs and traders, who suffered most in the changeover from the state­regulated welfare and protectionist policy of the previously ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party to the capitalist, market­oriented, free­trade policy heralded by the UNP in 1977. In sum, the 1983 riots were a kind of pogrom, which was motivated, purposive, systematic, and organized. Politically and economically, they were a punitive action against Tamils. Those who stood to gain most were, firstly, middle­level Sinhala entrepreneurs, businessmen, and white­collar workers, and, secondly, the urban poor, mainly through looting. Many of the latter were recent migrants from rural areas, whose living conditions had deteriorated as the open economy created and widened disparities of wealth and income distribution. Despite rising wages, their real incomes had declined as a result of inflation, urban housing scarcities, and the issuing of food stamps in place of the former subsidized rice program. Moreover, the measures taken to create an open­market economy caused short­term internal dislocations and imbalances, which were aggravated by pressure from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations. 17 Page 101 5 Sikh Identity, Separation, and Ethnic Conflict This chapter is primarily concerned with documenting the Hindu­Sikh riots that engulfed Delhi in 1984 and highlighting aspects of them that illustrate and illuminate the phenomenon of collective violence generated in the course of ethnic conflict. The history of the Sikhs, the conspicuous changes and transformations in their religion from their first guru, Nanak (1469–1539), to their tenth and last guru, Gobind Singh (1666–1708), and thereafter; their golden age under Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839), who constructed the Sikh empire in the Punjab, with its capital at Lahore, and who is alleged to have realized the cry \"The Khalsa shall rule!\" (attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, who created the Sikh warrior order called the Khalsa); their shifting fortunes under the British; all this and much else has been treated by many scholars. It will suffice here as a backdrop to the riots of 1984 if I point to a few landmark developments in the religious and political affairs of the Sikhs in India, especially in the Punjab, from the 1920s onwards. 1 The Successive Partitions of the Punjab One set of developments to bear in mind is the succession of \"partitions\" that the Punjab has undergone. A unitary Punjab under British rule was first partitioned in 1947 with the formation of Pakistan. It is well to remember that the creation of India and Pakistan in 1947 was done at a huge human cost: about half a million people died and around fifteen million people changed residence through migration. The Punjab as a whole felt the worst effects of the turmoil of Partition. There were twelve million refugees from the Punjab alone, and possibly two hundred thousand of its people were slaughtered. The killings began in March 1947, when Muslim Page 102 mobs killed Sikhs in large numbers in Rawalpindi. In turn, Sikhs in east and central Punjab began to arm and retaliate in kind against the Muslims, and these deadly exchanges led to the transfer of massive numbers of refugees. 2 In the newly created Indian Punjab, the population distribution in 1951 was 62 percent Hindu, 35 percent Sikh, and less than 3 percent Muslim. In 1966, the Punjab was divided again, when the Hindu majority areas, where Hindi speakers predominated, were separated off to form the new state of Haryana. Chandigarh became the joint capital of the two states. The Sikhs had campaigned for a Punjabi­speaking state, based both on linguistic grounds and on memories of the Sikh empire of Ranjit Singh. Reduced in territory to some 50,000 square kilometers, the new Punjab had a population of 11 million, about 60 percent of whom were Sikh. The linguistic state of Punjab was not achieved without dispute and contest. Although most people spoke Punjabi in daily life, it was a written language only for the Sikhs.3 And throughout the 1950s, in the face of Sikh propaganda, especially under the Akali Dal leader Master Tara Singh, for the right of self­determination for Sikhs, together with their espousal of the Punjabi language and \"Gurmukhi culture,\" the Punjabi Hindus by and large educated their children in Hindi and affirmed that Hindi was their mother tongue. \"The shift of Punjabi­speaking Hindus,\" Paul Brass has written, was \"more dramatic'' than any linguistic choice previously made in Punjab, \"because it was an overt and deliberate political act.\"4 Although the Indian government had consented to the creation of many linguistic states in the 1950s, there was resistance to the creation of a Punjabi­speaking state, despite Tara Singh's campaign.5 Punjabi Suba was achieved in 1966, after the deaths of Tara Singh and Nehru. Since the late 1980s, we have witnessed attempts by extremist Sikhs, especially the militant followers of the late Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, to effect a third partition through a secessionist demand for an independent state of Khalistan. The demand and its denial have led to the worst phase of internal violence that India has faced since independence. The Politics of the Akali Dal Movement The question of the separate identity of Sikhs, firmly distinguished from Hindus, seems to have come into prominence in the 1920s. At the very time of the Gandhian nationalist movement, the Sikhs, conscious of their own nationalist stirrings, took decisive steps to form two organizations, the Akali Dal (\"army of the faithful\") and the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (hereafter referred to as SGPC), which have played the most crucial roles in Sikh politics to this day. Page 103 In November 1920, an estimated 10,000 Sikhs met in Amritsar to establish a committee to draft new rules for the management of the Golden Temple there. It was this committee that became the SGPC. Soon afterwards, the Akali Dal was formed as a central organization to coordinate and direct local jathas, which were attempting to take control of the Sikh gurudwaras (temples) from the traditional mahants. The SGPC led by the Akali Dal activists forcibly took over shrine after shrine, and by 1925 the SGPC had gained formal ownership of some of the gurudwaras. The British colonial authorities recognized and legitimated the SGPC and made it \"the Religious Parliament of Sikhs,\" a position and a role that it claims to this day. The Sikh Gurudwaras and Shrines Act of 1925 placed more than 200 temples under the control of the SGPC, which was to be elected by all adult Sikhs living in Punjab. Controlling large funds—in the 1980s about Rs 70 million—the SGPC became a magnet for Sikh politicians. \"In the Sikh­majority Punjab formed in 1966 the SGPC became an organization which could create and destroy governments.\" 6 Although the Akali Dal decided to support the Raj in World War II, and succeeded in persuading Sikhs to join the British Indian Army, it had not yet forged a clear policy regarding the future of the Sikhs in the postwar world in 1947. Although there had been talk by Tara Singh of an independent Sikh state if the country were to be divided, there was no effective hooking up with the rounds of deliberations between the British, the Indian National Congress, and the Muslim League. And in the face of the violence of Partition and vast displacements of people as refugees, the Akali Dal consented to the partition of Punjab as inevitable. Political Contests, 1947–1984 In many ways, the most critical factors cumulatively leading to a politics of escalation, as well as of factionalism, were those that issued from a complicated but calculated contest between the political parties that controlled the federal government in Delhi and those that wielded power in Punjab State. In Delhi, the parties that would crucially compete for power, especially in the 1970s, were Congress (I), which ruled most of the time, and the Janata Party, which briefly came to power in 1977. In Punjab State, the political stakes were contested by Congress (I) on the one side and the Akali Dal and Janata in coalition on the other. The most critical feature of the dialectics of contest, which led to a fraught and spiraling trajectory of divisive violence, culminating in the extreme acts of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his fundamentalist militants, was the intersection and interference of federal politics with the politics of Page 104 Punjab State. For instance, it is said that it was Indira Gandhi and Congress (I) that originally set up and sponsored Bhindranwale as a rival to the Akali Dal, the political grouping that the local Congress (I) feared in Punjab, and that was led by a triumvirate of Sikh leaders, namely, Parkash Singh Badal, a former Punjab chief minister; Harchand Singh Longowal, a respected religious leader; and Gurucharan Singh Tohra, who headed the SGPC. This tangle was further aggravated by the personal differences between Zail Singh, then union home minister, and Punjab's Congress (I) chief minister, Darbara Singh. In the end, the politics of divide and rule turned out to be a nightmare for the government of Indira Gandhi, whose death they brought about. The wrestling between Congress and the Akali Dal goes back to the early days of independence. Then, too, there was an antagonistic pairing between Partap Singh Kairon, a Jat, who was Congress chief minister of Punjab and an ally of Nehru's, and Master Tara Singh, a Khatri, a leading figure in the Akali Dal, and several times president of the SGPC. Both leaders had been part of the Gandhian nationalist movement, but Tara Singh had already in the early 1950s accused the Hindu majority of trying to absorb the Sikhs, and advocated Punjabi Suba, a new state that would safeguard the Punjabi language and the interests of the Sikhs. After 1960, Tara Singh and the Akali Dal had decisively terminated friendly dealings with Congress, and Tara Singh led a campaign of civil disobedience for the creation of Punjabi Suba. Since the time of Tara Singh and since the creation of Punjabi Suba, there have been three significant interrelated developments in the politics of the Punjab. First, there was the rise of the Jat Sikhs, 7 with their power base located among the Sikh peasantry in rural areas, and their domination in time of the Akali Dal. It is generally recognized that the Sikhs in Punjab are divided into three categories: (a) the Khatri, who are urban in origin and have traditionally practiced commercial, trading, and clerical occupations, and who produced not only all ten gurus but also Master Tara Singh, the most forceful of the modern Sikh leaders; (b) the Jats, rural agriculturalists who constitute up to 60 percent of the Sikhs, and from whose ranks came Sant Fateh Singh, Master Tara Singh's successor; and (c) the minority of \"low castes,\" namely, the Mazhabis (untouchables), and the Ramgarhias (artisans). Second, especially in the 1960s, many Jat Sikhs changed their political affiliation from Congress to the Akali Dal, a change facilitated by the fall of P.S. Kairon in 1964. In the elections of 1967, the majority of MLA's of Akali designation, about twenty­four in number, were Jat Sikhs. Page 105 Third, there was the intensification of the already ingrained factionalism of Punjab politics, which was laced with violence, the latter being in some commentators' eyes a mode of enacting politics brought with them by the Jat Sikhs. 8 Congress's loss of control of Punjab politics and the increasing factionalism and violence of Indian politics in general went hand in hand. In February 1967, the United Front, made up of non­Congress parties and led by the Akali Dal, took office. And the next five years were turbulent, with shifts of control and two dramatic interventions by the federal center. The United Front gave way after a few months to a Congress­supported minority \"Janta Party\" in November 1967, whose rule was superseded, again after only a few months, by president's rule (August 1960–February 1969). President's rule gave way to Akali Dal­Jana Sangh coalitions, which lasted till about June 1971, to be replaced again by president's rule with the collapse of the Akali Dal government and the beginning of the third Indo­Pakistan War. During the next five years (1972–77), there was Congress rule in Punjab, with Giani Zail Singh as chief minister: but while a state of emergency imposed on the whole country helped Zail Singh continue in office, a sustained and powerful opposition to Congress rule was mounted by the Akali Dal, staged from the gurudwaras. The elections of March 1977 saw the triumphant return of the Akali Dal, which formed a coalition government with the Janata Party. The humiliated Congress did not win a single seat. Parkash Singh Badal was now enthroned as chief minister, but his coalition collapsed two years later, amidst a mounting tide of violence that would progressively engulf Punjab. The Congress Party, led by Indira Gandhi, lost the national elections of 1977 as well, and gave way to a Janata Party government, which, however, torn by internal dissension and factional politics, was dissolved in January 1980. Although the Congress Party lost the election in Punjab in 1977 and was out of power in Delhi, it had set in motion the old strategy of splitting the Akali Dal and promoting factionalism, this time with diabolical results. As Robin Jeffrey explains, \"the technique developed was to encourage dissatisfied Akali factions to start a campaign 'for complete autonomy of Punjab' and to accuse their own government of failure to look after Sikh interests. This would anger Hindus in the Janata Party, put Akali ministers in the position of having to qualify their devotion to their religion and thus divide Parkash Singh Badal's government. In the ensuing disarray it might be possible to 'bring in a Congress (I) government.' \"9 It is these political strategies and tactics that help explain the temporary Page 106 crossing of the interests of Indira Gandhi and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Jat Sikh from southern Punjab, who was a charismatic and dynamic young Sant. Bhindranwale's call for a revived Sikhism, dedicated to the old militant ideals and aggressive masculinity of Guru Gobind Singh's Khalsa (the order of the pure), and in due course an autonomous state of Khalistan, reminiscent of the glories and trials of the eighteenth century, gathered a following especially of young Sikhs disenchanted with the worldly politics and compromises of their elders. 10 On April 13, 1978, Bhindranwale had made his mark when he and his followers staged a march and broke up the annual convention of the Sant Nirankaris held at the holy city of Amritsar on the grounds that this group was actually heretical, reprobate, and anti­Sikh, because, contrary to Gobind's ruling that he was the last guru, this religious group believed in a living guru, and contrary to Gobind's ruling that the canon was thereafter closed, this group made additions to it.11 The Nirankaris were also accused of being lax in some of their practices, notably the worship of the sandals of Baba Gurbachan Singh, their spiritual head. This encounter was marked by armed violence—three Nirankaris and a dozen Sikhs lost their lives—and it was an omen of things to come. \"Baba Gurbachan Singh was shot dead in April 1980. His death was followed by mass killings of Sant Nirankaris in Punjab.\"12 It has been alleged that Indira Gandhi and her circle of advisers saw in Bhindranwale an agent who could be used to challenge the Akali Dal leaders in Punjab. Their calculation was that Bhindranwale's aggressive promotion of exclusivist Sikh claims would help loosen the Akali's bonds with urban Hindus. In August 1978, a Dal Khalsa had been founded in Chandigarh, pledged to achieve an independent Sikh state, and it is alleged that Congress (I) and Zail Singh (the former chief minister) had helped finance the first meeting.13 It would seem that Congress had actively tried to undermine the Akali Dal's candidates' chances of winning the 1979 elections to the SGPC, and that although it was unsuccessful in its aim, it did manage to sow the seeds of dissension within the Akali Dal. Bhindranwale's faction was one that emerged as a prominent presence, dedicated to extremist causes and to the purification of the faith. In January 1980, Indira Gandhi and Congress (I) won the general elections, but Punjab politics had reached such a state of turmoil, and the violence practiced by Bhindranwale and his armed gangs had helped destabilize Punjab to such an extent, that Indira Gandhi seized the opportunity to dissolve Parkash Singh Badal's government and call for fresh elections at Page 107 the end of May. The escalation of violent acts and the slide toward \"terrorism\" can be gauged from this enumeration of murders and vendettas: On April 24, 1980, Gurbachan Singh, the leader of the Nirankari Mission, was assassinated in Delhi. Bhindranwale's involvement was suspected. On September 9, 1981, Lala Jagat Narain, head of the Punjab Kesari chain of newspapers, an ally of Partap Singh Kairon's, was submachine­gunned by three Sikh motorcycle riders. Two days earlier, the Akali Dal had organized a peaceful and orderly procession of some 100,000 Sikh marchers. The Akali's new president, Harchand Singh Longowal, played a prominent part in advancing Sikh claims—for example, that Amritsar be declared a holy city—and in affirming the nationhood of Sikhs within the Union of India. The murder of Narain was attributed to Bhindranwale, and a warrant was issued for his arrest; a gun battle ensued, but Bhindranwale managed to elude the chase and took refuge at his headquarters at Chowk Mehta in Punjab, before giving himself up in the presence of a crowd of 50,000 people. \"Then the rioting began; before it was over the police had opened fire and eight people were dead.\" 14 The police in fact had no hard evidence against Bhindranwale, and he was released. This episode confirmed his ascendance as the charismatic leader of the extremists in Punjab and made him a sworn enemy of the government, dedicated to winning Khalistan, if necessary by violent means. The arrest and release of Bhindranwale triggered a barrage of violent incidents in the following months, the like of which had never happened before. On September 22, a submachine gun sprayed bullets in Jullundur Market; an Indian Airlines plane was hijacked a week later; two policemen were killed and their weapons stolen; a bomb exploded in Bhindranwale's own headquarters, killing three; and a number of other assassinations took place, the most conspicuous being that of Santokh Singh, \"the most powerful Sikh in New Delhi, closely connected to the Congress (I) and a regular associate of Bhindranwale\" on December 21.15 In short, shootings and killings were being directed by multiple actors, including agents of the state, at one another. It was difficult to discern who was doing what to whom and why. As public order deteriorated, the menace of violence hung in the air. Violence rather than being an aberration was becoming the routine form of enacting politics. Finally, on October 5, 1983, a massacre of bus passengers, all Hindu, prompted the declaration of president's rule in Punjab. On February 27, 1984, Parkash Singh Badal, twice chief minister of Punjab, publicly burned the Indian Constitution and proclaimed his support for the aims of Bhindranwale's crusade, showing that highly placed Page 108 Sikhs disenchanted with government policy were being drawn toward an extremist position. At the last stages of his marked career, Bhindranwale, fearing arrest by the government, occupied the Akal Takt in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar with a number of his followers and fortified it. Trained and equipped with modern weapons, they prepared for what they must have suspected was to be their last siege. The Punjab police were as deeply divided as civil society. The fateful storming of the Golden Temple by the Indian Army, code­named \"Operation Blue Star,\" occurred on June 6, 1984. A thousand people were killed, pilgrims among them, along with Bhindranwale and his followers, and the buildings were extensively damaged (see figure 1). This show of force by the Indian government was viewed as an outrage by the majority of the Sikh community—even among those far removed from the politics of both the Akali and Bhindranwale—and provided the impetus for a further escalation of violence and terror. On October 31, 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was herself assassinated by her Sikh security guards, and a tornado of violence devastated Delhi (and other places, such as Kanpur, Bokaro, and Indore). Delhi's intellectuals plunged into an anguished search for understanding. \"Why did this kind of horror—and it's a qualitatively new type of horror in our body­politic—erupt at all, tearing apart a 500 year history of spiritual and symbiotic relationships?\" Darshan Singh Maini asked. 16 Rajni Kothari has sketched the prevailing mood among the Hindus, especially in North India, who felt \"that the Sikhs were more like enemies than friends, that they were the cause of national disintegration, that they were responsible for large scale murders of Hindus in Punjab (actually more Sikhs were killed by the extremists than Hindus), that they were an aggressive and violent people, loyal to Bhindranwale and other extremists, on the whole out to undermine Indian unity. All this got reinforced by wild rumours and press censorship.\"17 Mounting resentment of the Sikhs was compounded by the perception that they were disproportionately prosperous and economically successful. Following Indira Gandhi's assassination, the predominantly Hindu population of Delhi unleashed a massive orgy of violence against the minority Sikhs. The vast majority of the victims were Sikh inhabitants of \"the settlement colonies\" on the fringes of the city, who were by origin not drawn from the ranks of the Punjabi Jats or Khatri, but were either Sindhi Sikhs, a residue of the refugee exodus at the time of Partition, or \"low­caste\" Mazhabi Sikhs living on the edge of poverty. Neither of these slum populations had anything to do with the involuted and explosive politics that Page 109 Figure 1. Sikh militants guarding the Golden Temple in Amritsar before Operation Blue Star. Pramod Pushkarna (India Today). Page 110 counterposed the Akali Dal activists, Bhindranwale's militants, and Congress (I) politicians. What features of the urban landscape of Delhi itself, its distribution of power, disposition of space, congested contiguity of peoples, electoral strategies, slum landlordism, and municipal politics contributed to the rampage of the crowds? How do we differentiate the issues and strains of the wider political scene from the particular demographic and spatial ecology of the metropolis of Delhi, and then relate the two? The Anti­Sikh Riots of 1984 in Delhi In 1984, Hindus comprised 83 percent of Delhi's total population of about 6.2 million people. Estimates of the Sikh population ranged from 6.3 percent to 7.5 percent (an estimated 300,000–500,000 people). A majority of them had settled in Delhi after Partition (1947), before which the Sikhs were only 1.2 percent of the city's population. 18 The riots occurred in many different parts of the city but were at their worst in localities such as Munrika in the south, Mangolpuri and Sultanpuri in the west, Trilokpuri and Kalyanpuri in the east, and Jahangiripuri in the north. The literature refers to these poorer sections of Delhi as the trans­Jamuna colonies and resettlement colonies. Whatever the previous history of Hindu­Sikh relations, and their exchanges of violence, one thing is clear about the riots that occurred in Delhi between October 31 and November 4, 1984: \"This violence was essentially one sided, namely, the non­Sikhs attacked the Sikhs and damaged, looted, and burnt their properties, . . . \\[and\\] Gurudwaras, and killed a few thousand of them.\"19 The authors of Who Are the Guilty? observe that their own individual experiences as well as extensive interviews with varied persons (victims, their neighbors, police officers, political leaders, army officers) \"suggest that the attack on the Sikhs followed a common pattern, whether they took place in Munrika in the South, or Mangolpuri in the West, or Trilokpuri in the East. The uniformity in the sequence of events at every spot were masterminded by some powerful organized groups. ... Newspaper reports suggest that this pattern \\[was\\] similar in all Congress (I) ruled states.\"20 The authors of a second report, Report of the Citizens' Commission, affirmed a collective purposiveness behind the carnage: \"The remarkable uniformity in the pattern of the crimes committed, with some local variations, strongly suggests that at some stage the objective became to 'Teach the Sikhs a lesson.'\"21 It is certainly noteworthy that the announcement of Page 111 the Indian Parliament on April 26, 1985, concerning the formation of an official commission—which came to be called the Misra Commission, taking the name of its chairman, Justice Ranganath Misra—to inquire into the riots stated that the commissioners' task was \"to inquire into the allegations in regard to the incidents of organized violence which took place in Delhi following the assassination of the late Prime Minister\" (emphasis added). Although the Delhi administration itself denied \"the allegation of organized violence and stated that all possible steps were taken to quell the riots at \\[the\\] shortest time possible,\" and although advocates on the Sikh and Hindu sides exaggerated or underestimated the degree of directed violence, it seems a fair judgment to say that the riots in some of their phases showed patterns of organization. 22 Naturally, the parties making representations to the Misra Commission differed in their accounts of what took place. Thus for instance, the Citizens' Justice Commission (CJC), representing Sikh interests and containing retired justices, judges, military officers, and advocates made the forceful and extreme charge that \"the violence in Delhi was premeditated, organized and was perpetrated methodically. . . so as to lead to the irresistible conclusion of central direction, guidance and control. The task was without doubt performed with the complicity, connivance and active involvement of the administration as well as the members of the ruling party.\" The CJC later withdrew from the hearings, alleging partiality on the part of the Misra Commission. A radically opposite submission was made by the Nagrik Suraksha Samiti, representing the Arya Samaj point of view. It denied that the riots were \"the handiwork of any organized group of people,\" asserting that they \"were all sporadic and spontaneous and ... erupted \\[because of\\] grave provocation and anger on account of the tragic assassination of the late Prime Minister . . . which aroused a sudden and tremendous feeling of shock, distress, and uncontrollable anger amongst the people.\" The Samiti also reminded the Misra Commission that the assailants \"had in their mind the events that had taken place in Punjab earlier and had known the atrocities committed by some members of the Sikh community as extremists.'' The Trajectory of the Riots The rioting began in the evening of October 31, 1984, and had more or less abated by the end of November 4. It may thus be said to have lasted from three to four days. Page 112 First Day: October 31 Indira Gandhi was shot on October 31, 1984, at 9:15 A.M. by two of her Sikh security guards. She was rushed to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for treatment. By 11:00 A.M., All Indian Radio (AIR) reported that she had been attacked; by 2:30 P.M., the evening editions of several papers in the capital carried the news of her death, identifying Sikhs as the assailants. Crowds had been gathering at the AIIMS, and there were stray incidents of assaults on Sikh passers­by. Soon after All Indian Radio announced Indira Gandhi's death, gathering crowds \"went on a rampage in several parts of Delhi adjacent to the AIIMS, namely Safdarjung Enclave, Laxmibai Nagar, INA Market and South Extension.\" 23 The Misra Commission's version is that the rioters, forming different groups in the vicinity of the AIIMS, proceeded toward the Defence Colony, RK Puram, Prithviraj Road, and Hauz Khas, indulging in violence and arson on the way.24 Word spread quickly, inciting attacks in various places in the city, although the main incidents were reported from the places in South Delhi where the riots had begun (see map 2). \"By the late evening \\[of October 31\\], outbreaks occurred in areas as far afield as New Friends Colony, Lajpat Nagar, Karol Bagh and New Delhi. Gurudwaras, houses, shops, factories, workshops and other property belonging to Sikhs were looted and damaged or destroyed. Sikh pedestrians and passengers, dragged out of cars or buses, were assaulted.\"25 Another account reports \"the arrival of young people in tempo vans, scooters, motorcycles or trucks from the night of October 31\" at places such as Munrika, Saket, South Extension, Lajpat Nagar, Bhogpal, Jangpura, and Ashram in the south and southeast; at the Connaught Circus shopping area in the center, and later, at the trans­Jamuna colonies and resettlement colonies in other areas in the north.26 Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv Gandhi, who was sworn as prime minister at 6:50 P.M., made a broadcast to the nation appealing for calm, but it was ineffective, as were AIR and television (Doordarshan) broadcasts of an order prohibiting the assembly of five or more persons and the carrying of arms in the Union Territory of Delhi. The rumors were three. First, Sikhs were distributing sweets and lighting lamps to celebrate Mrs. Gandhi's death. . . . The second rumor was that train­loads of hundreds of Hindu dead bodies had arrived at Old Delhi Station from Punjab. Third, water was poisoned by the Sikhs. As for the latter two rumors, we came across evidence of policemen in vans touring certain localities and announcing through loudspeakers the arrival of the train and the poisoning of water. In certain areas, we heard that police officials had rung up residents Page 113 advising them not to drink the water. These rumors (the last two were officially repudiated later) contributed to the shaping of a public mind that acquiesced in the attacks and murders that took place soon after. 27 Second Day: November 1 This day was critical in that the wave of rioting that had begun around the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where the stricken Mrs. Gandhi was taken, spread in widening ripples through various parts of the city proper already named, reaching its maximal virulence and destructive fury in the resettlement colonies, such as Sultanpuri and Mangolpuri in West Delhi, Trilokpuri and Kalyanpuri, trans­Jamuna colonies in the east of Delhi, and other places such as Gandhi Nagar, Janakpuri, and Palam Colony. I shall in a later section deal with the collective violence directed against the Sikhs in these settlements on Delhi's periphery, whose inhabitants were mostly of the \"lower social orders,\" the urban working class, artisans, small businessmen, and lower ranges of the Congress (I) Party hierarchy, and their clients, thugs, and retinues (\"the criminal elements\"). All the sources available to me amply document the experiences and views of victims and neighbors of these settlements, and most of them unambiguously establish that certain identified Congress (I) leaders, workers, and activists mobilized and directed the arsonists, and that local block leaders (pradhans) and activists actually identified Sikh houses, shops, businesses, gurudwaras, and schools for the mobs. The chief administrators of Delhi, the lieutenant governor and the home minister, responded tardily to requests that the police force be more effectively deployed and dragged their feet about the need to call in the army when the evidence of police indifference to the pleas of victims for protection and collusion with the arsonists in the destruction of property and even the killing of Sikhs was submitted by several members of Parliament, distinguished citizens, social workers, journalists, and the like. The same administrators did not think it necessary at that time to set up camps for refugees. An indefinite curfew was imposed at 6:00 P.M. that day. Third Day: November 2 Violence and terror continued unabated. Reports appeared of an increase in the orgy of arson, rape, and murder; of Sikh passengers on trains being murdered; and of trains approaching Delhi being forcibly stopped by crowds in outlying areas in order to enable them to attack Sikh passengers. \"As a large number of victims who had been rendered homeless fled in terror, no less than eighteen unofficial camps came into being.\"28 In other Page 114 Map 2. Delhi Page 116 words, it was only on the third day that voluntary agencies and concerned citizens, faced with governmental sloth, endeavored to provide as best they could for the displaced, both in terms of material care and emotional solace. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi made a second broadcast in the evening, reiterating his government's commitment to restoring and preserving communal peace. Reports mounted of trains approaching Delhi being invaded by mobs assembled at railway stations. Sikh passengers were attacked and frequently beaten to death and set afire on the spot, sometimes while alive. The logic of this was that immediate burning of the bodies prevents the identity of the dead from being known. Cutting of hair and shaving off the beard, thereby removing the most obvious marks of Sikh identity, preceded the burning. As Kulbir Singh, an eloquent victim, remarked: \"All the attacks took place in the Hindu belt, and \\[they\\] certainly occurred in those states where the Congress (I) was in power. . . . In those places where there were non­Congress parties but which I'd call communal \\[they\\] didn't happen.\" For example, the attacks did not occur \"in the trains going towards Bombay or in the Bombay region.\" They happened on trains coming toward Delhi, which was clearly within the Hindu belt. \"And the fact that they took place on the 1st \\[of November\\] suggests that they had enough time to think and plan.\" 29 This informant, Kulbir Singh, a twenty­eight­year­old businessman, was on his way home to Bihar after a business trip to Delhi. He was pulled out of the train on November 1 at Gawa Road Station, beaten up, and left for dead. He found his way to the local hospital, where he was given little care (''It's Sardars \\[Sikhs\\] so let them just die . . .\"), until he was rescued by a Hindu friend. A middle­class Hindu woman named Ratnabehn, who was traveling toward Delhi from Baroda, reported that when the train—the Janata—arrived at Tughlakabad Station at about 10:30 or 11:00 A.M. on November 1, gangs armed with iron rods and cycle chains and carrying kerosene attacked and killed some Sikh passengers, all male. Before this train, two other trains, the Rajdhani and Deluxe, had also been stopped and attacked, so that the mobs had been at work all morning. It was estimated that about twenty­four to twenty­five Sikhs had been killed. Ratnabehn recalled: We gathered from the other passengers that the crowd was attacking Sikhs and so the people in the compartment quickly locked the doors and pulled down the shutters. . . . When the doors remained closed \\[the crowd\\] threatened to burn the bogey so the passengers had to open the doors. A group of about eight or ten young men, between the ages of twenty and twenty­five, armed Page 117 with iron rods came into the compartment to make a search for Sikhs. Some of the non­Sikh passengers tried to hide the four or five Sikhs in the compartment but the mob managed to search them out and then they began to drag them \\[away\\]. Among the passengers was a sanyasini (an ascetic holy woman), who in particular, along with other passengers, \"pleaded with folded hands and requested them not to attack the Sikhs. They even argued that killing or attacking the Sikhs was no way to react to Mrs. Gandhi's assassination . . . \\[saying,\\] 'Is this how we are showing Indiraji that we respect her?'\" \"For a while the attacking group was temporarily halted . . . and the attackers began to leave the compartment. But immediately afterwards the first attacking group was replaced by a more militant group which did not show any feelings for the pleas of the passengers. They just ruthlessly hunted down the Sikhs without any mercy.\" An old man was dragged out, his hair was first burnt, then he was doused with kerosene and set on fire. Two other younger men tried to run away but they were caught. \"The old man who had been set on fire . . . continued to burn screaming with agony and remained alive right through the time the train remained halted at the station.\" 30 On November 1, too, Doordarshan television coverage of mourners filing past Mrs. Gandhi's body lying in state at Teenmurti Bhavan, broadcast shouts of \"Khoon ka badla khoon!\" (\"Blood for blood!\"). Although at the time many blamed the television authorities for irresponsible conduct, the Misra Commission, after its inquiry a year later, reported the director general of Doordarshan's explanation that the shouts were transmitted because the telecast was live, and that the coverage was terminated when the incident took place. The Misra Commission stated without comment: \"When the cassette \\[of the relevant portion of the televised program\\] was played, the Commission found that the shout had been repeated eighteen times spread over 37 seconds.\"31 Fourth Day: November 3 This was the day of Indira Gandhi's cremation. The national media, Akashvani and Doordarshan, covered the event in detail. Aside from the thousands lined up to watch the cortege, many more viewed it on television. It is very likely that the cremation was a cathartic climax to the national tragedy, and that it probably also foreshadowed the inevitable subsidence of the rioting. Large contingents of the armed forces, in addition to performing their ceremonial duties in connection with the funeral, were also by then a visi­ Page 118 ble presence in many parts of the city, doing a much better job of surveillance and riot control than the police force had done hitherto. The curfew was also being more effectively enforced than before. Fifth Day: November 4 As observed earlier, communal riots mercifully do not last at any given location for more than a few days. As the cathartic violence of the crowds is spent, the agencies of the state and the security forces, which shock or collusion had initially made inert, increasingly begin to assert their regulatory and preventive authority. Soldiers on the streets and strict imposition of curfew are the signs of a return to (uneasy) normalcy. Thus, while sporadic incidents of violence continued to occur here and there in Delhi, it had by and large dawned on the administration and civilian leaders that the visible problems of the displaced, the refugees, the injured, and the bereaved demanded relief. Time and again, these tasks constitute the aftermath of communal violence and ethnic riots. Figures of the numbers killed, maimed, and arrested, and estimates of the havoc done, the houses, vehicles and other property destroyed, damaged, and looted, are publicized, confirmed, and contested. Overviews of the disaster, postmortems by official and unofficial commissions of inquiry, are begun, and reports are composed with an eye to their timeliness and relevance to a public that must retrospectively digest and come to terms with the outburst. The Scale of the Destruction The Report of the Citizens' Commission describes the havoc wrought by the riots thus: During the four days of mob rule over large areas of Delhi, the loss of life and property was staggering. According to responsible estimates, well over two thousand were murdered, leaving behind over a thousand widows and numerous orphans (emphasis added). Sikh educational institutions, several large gurudwaras and many Sikh houses were burnt. Trucks, taxicabs, three­wheeler scooters, cars, motorcycles and scooters were burnt in their hundreds. Movable property, cash and jewelry were stolen and destroyed. Factories and business premises, together with machinery and stock­in­trade were looted, damaged or destroyed. 32 The home minister announced in Parliament that the number of Sikhs killed in Delhi during the 1984 riots was 2,141, and that another 586 persons were said to have been killed in other parts of the country during that period. The Misra Commission reports that the Delhi administration filed Page 119 with it a list of 2,212 persons \"upon whose death payment of compensation had been admitted and given to the next of kin.\" 33 The Delhi administration subsequently filed a statement that the number of deaths caused by the riots was 2,307. The Citizens' Justice Commission, however, representing Sikh interests, submitted a list of 3,879 deaths to the Misra Commission, which concluded that the correct figure had to be somewhere between the higher figure of the committee and the lower figure conceded by the Delhi administration. The killings were carried out with a pitiless frenzy that strains interpretation. \"It is in evidence that hundreds of people so killed were burnt while they were half dead or while they were in an unconscious state or had already died. The DSGMC \\[Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee\\] has specified in written arguments the names of 73 people who were burnt alive after they became unconscious and thirteen persons who were burnt after they died. There is evidence that hundreds of charred bodies were recovered.\"34 The damage and looting to property was extensive and thorough. The Delhi administration reported to the Misra Commission that a total of 180 gurudwaras spread over different parts of the city had been subject to arson, looting, and burning, and that about eleven educational institutions, all founded and run by Sikh groups, had been damaged in a similar manner.35 The purposiveness of these acts of destruction and appropriation did not escape the guarded and oblique prose of the Misra Commission: \"From the fact that so many gurudwaras and educational institutions had been damaged, it is reasonable to hold that the rioters not only had the Sikh populations as their targets but also kept an eye on their religious institutions.\"36 There was a definite pattern in the choice of victims. Both the Sikhs who were killed and their assailants were predominately males aged 20–50. However, in those areas where there was most arson and lynching, such as the resettlement colonies, women and children as well as old persons were also victimized or burned alive. Some women were raped. The documentation by Uma Chakravarty and Nandita Haksar in The Delhi Riots: Three Days in the Life of a Nation, based on detailed interviews with victims, leaves us in no doubt that although Sikh males were the first target in these areas, the brutalities and arson frequently became indiscriminate and knew no restraints (see figure 2). A chartered accountant, a non­Sikh and a resident of New Friends' Colony, gave an eyewitness account, which the Citizens' Commission reports as follows: \"The crowd was armed with lathis, crow­bars and iron rods. Page 120 Figure 2. Arson committed during the anti­Sikh riots in Delhi in 1984. Pramod Pushkarna (India Today). Page 121 Figure 3. Property destruction during the anti­Sikh riots in Delhi in 1984. India Today. They did not see any firearms, either with the crowd or with the beleaguered Sikhs. . . . In New Friends' Colony, they saw several Sikh­owned shops which had been set on fire. Intervening shops belonging to Hindus had not been touched. . . . Two trucks parked nearby were set on fire. The crowd then invaded the gurudwara opposite the shops. They ransacked the rooms in the gurudwara compound and set fire to the buildings\" (see figure 3). 37 Here is how another witness described the burning of the Sikh­owned Khalsa Middle School, situated in Sarojini Nagar (in this case the destruction worked against the interests of the Hindus themselves, since the majority of the students belonged to their own community): On the afternoon of 1 November, at about 3:30 or 4 P.M., a mob of about 250–300 men came to the school which has 525 pupils of whom 65% are non­Sikhs. The mob first set fire to the tents and the school desks. Thereafter, they demolished the boundary wall of the school. They then entered the building and broke open the steel cupboards and looted them. They stole the school typewriter, instruments belonging to the school band, utensils, etc. Two desks and seven steel cupboards were seen being taken away. They destroyed the library and scientific equipment in the laboratory. The school building was burnt as also the Headmaster's scooter.38 It may be suggested that, leaving aside the massive destruction of human life, the burning of homes, property, goods, and vehicles of all kinds Page 122 is a double action that expresses as much the attacking mob's own sense of relative \"deprivation\" and inaccessibility to worldly goods as it does the mob's purposive reduction of the enemy's affluence and its demotion to a lower level. 39 The bonfires, the public destruction of property by fire, are a reversal of the paradigmatic potlatch of the Kwakiutl. In the potlatch, the possessors destroyed their accumulated surplus wealth in a public display of conspicuous waste in order to shame their competitors and enhance their status. In the communal riots, it is possessors who are despoiled by a mob that burns their possessions—and loots them as well—in order to level down and equalize poverty. Organized Violence in the Settlement Colonies \"The killings which were widespread, especially in the outlying colonies, were the result of the instigation of local political cadres who mobilized some political workers and criminal elements and hoodlums from neighboring villages as well as from the neighborhood itself. In some areas, especially the congested and poor, women were raped and molested\" (emphasis added).40 These observations have been confirmed by all the sources consulted, and direct our attention to the distinctive circumstances prevailing on Delhi's periphery, which may shed light on this extreme manifestation of violence. The outlying settlements such as Trilokpuri, Mangolpuri, and Sultanpuri had a special relation to Congress (I). These settlements were initiated by the Congress (I) as part of its urban resettlement program. The resettlement program, begun in 1960, has progressively spawned more and more colonies, which dramatically proliferated in the Emergency period (June 1975–February 1977) in particular. By 1984, there were some forty colonies, with densely packed populations ranging from 30,000 to 300,000 in each. The inhabitants of these colonies were thus beholden to Congress (I) and were considered its strong support base and constituency, providing not only votes but also participants in political rallies. \"There exists in such areas an established organizational network through which masses are mobilized for demonstration of Congress (I)'s ostensible support.\"41 A veteran Delhi politician is reported as describing them as \"the best kept women\" (rakhel) of Congress (I). It is therefore in line with this setup that these settlers should willingly have lent their muscle (and at the same time indulged their greed for loot) when they were beckoned by the local political bosses to take punitive action against the Sikhs. But there is also a tragic irony to this story of political patronage. Many of the Sikhs who had been given allotments in these settlement colonies Page 123 had also been thankful to Congress (I), had been its supporters, and had voted for it. Hence the chagrin of these Sikhs that their local Congress (I) activists, block leaders (pradhan), and elected Congress officials should have directed the attacks on them. \"Sufferers from Trilokpuri and Mangolpuri . . . whom we met looked dazed and uncomprehending when they said to us: 'We were allotted their houses here by Indiraji. We have always voted for her party. Why were we attacked?'\" 42 The authors of The Delhi Riots record the pathos of the feelings of abandonment by the Congress (I) and its agencies of state expressed by the Sikhs of Trilokpur and Sultanpuri, who had served as traditional vote banks of the ruling party. The story of Nanki Bai, who lost both her husband and fourteen members of her extended family, tells it all. Her husband ran a mat­making business in Kalyanapuri, which employed some workers. He was a good provider. Nanki Bai had led a sheltered life, and the family had saved money and jewelry as dowry for their daughter. Nanki Bai spoke obsessively of her husband, who was burnt alive. She felt guilty that he had died on an empty stomach. \"He had not eaten anything because he was mourning Mrs. Gandhi's death.\"43 The family had shut themselves in a house. The crowd broke open the door, and struck down Nanki Bai's husband with a lathi (staff). Then \"the rioters tore open a part of the ceiling and set the room on fire. When the people tried to escape they were stoned and pushed back into the burning room.\" As another victim said of people who were killed in similar fashion, they died \"like goats in a slaughter house.\"44 Nanki Bai reported that on November 2, she counted thirty­two bodies, which were removed in her presence by the police. The bodies were piled in a truck and taken away. The politics and dynamics of riot behavior in the resettlement colonies cannot be fully comprehended without taking into account the populations of the villages at the periphery of the colonies. The participation of Jats and Gujjars from the so­called urban villages of Delhi substantially added to the numbers of rioters and contributed to the riots, murders, and looting. They were particularly dominant in West and South Delhi. Most of these villagers had once owned land in Ber Sarai, Munirka, and Mohammadpur, which had been taken away for the urban expansion of New Delhi. Their remaining land was generally unirrigated and of very poor quality. For this reason the villagers in these areas had to augment their resources through nonagricultural means, not the least of these being brigandage. Many invested in transport companies and brick­kilns, while others constructed houses on their remaining lands for the purpose of renting them. They thus controlled some economic resources and acquired political clout. It is Page 124 a known fact that if one is to make any headway in an election in Delhi, the Gujjars and Jats of these areas have to be on one's side. Unfortunately, much of the police force stationed in this area and round about was drawn from these communities. For this reason, there had on various occasions been noticeable complicity in these areas between the criminals and the police. This truth was brought home starkly during the riots. The authors of Who Are the Guilty? note: As for the Scheduled Caste communities who were displaced due to the acquisition of land for urban expansion those from the Valmiki community utilized the benefits of the reservation policy and came into the city where they found jobs in the police, UPSC, etc. The Bangis went into the Corporation, while the third­major group, the Dhanaks, considered the lowest caste, are engaged in a variety of odd jobs. Among the Scheduled Caste communities living in the resettlement colonies, the Valmikis are predominately supporters of Jagivan Ram, while the Bhangis are solid supporters of Congress (I). Information gathered by us from the trouble spots in these areas suggests that the Bhangis— many of them working as sweepers in the corporation—comprised the bulk of the local miscreants who attacked the Sikhs. It is this background and context that makes comprehensible this observation: \"In some areas, like Trilokpuri, Mangolpuri and the trans­Jamuna colonies, the arsonists consisted of Gujjar or Jat farmers from neighboring villages, and were accompanied by local residents, some of whom, were Congress (I) activists. In these areas, we were told Congress (I) followers of the Bhangi caste (belonging to the scheduled caste community) took part in the looting.\" 45 Events that took place in one settlement colony, Trilokpuri, reveal much about the perpetrators of the communal violence. This is a story of how certain influential politicians, with the police acting as their accessories, were able to mobilize mobs and enact a reign of terror for more than forty­eight hours, while immobilizing the forces of law and order. In this settlement, between October 31 and November 2, at least 400 Sikhs, mainly young men, were burnt alive, with the connivance of the local police and active participation of an organized group of miscreants led by a Congress (I) councilor (see figure 4). These brutalities were preceded by circulation of the kind of rumors described earlier about the diabolical doings of the Sikhs to celebrate Indira Gandhi's death. The beginning of the tragedy could be traced to the night of October 31 when reportedly the Congress (I) Councillor Ashok Kumar, a doctor who runs a clinic in Kalyanpuri, one kilometer from Trilokpuri, held a meeting at the latter place. The violence that broke out immediately following the meeting Page 125 Figure 4. Widows and children of Sikh men killed during the anti­Sikh riots in Delhi, 1984. Raghu Rai (India Today). Page 126 reached its climax next morning, when Gujjar farmers from the neighboring village of Chilla landed at Trilokpuri, and accompanied by a group of local inhabitants (described by the residents as Scheduled Caste people) raided Blocks 28, 32, 33 and 34 and systematically attacked Sikh houses, dragged out the young men, killed and burnt them and set the houses on fire. In some cases, the assailants hit the victims with iron rods on their heads before pouring kerosene on them. 46 The authors of Who Are the Guilty? report that when they visited Trilokpuri on the morning of November 3, many of the survivors informed them that the local Congress (I) councilor, Dr. Ashok Kumar, had instigated the mob, which had a free run for two full days until the arrival of the troops. The police too were alleged to have behaved in line with the objectives of Dr. Kumar's onslaught. This same Congress politician and local bigwig was also the subject of bitter complaints by survivors interviewed by the authors of The Delhi Riots. Nanki Bai described how Ashok Kumar directed his thugs, while keeping at a distance himself. He got the sweepers to do the dirty work. ''He gave them daru (liquor). He had the killings done by the kanjars \\[a group of sweepers\\] and the bhangis \\[another group of sweepers\\]. The educated can't do this kind of thing—only the neech­log \\[low­caste people\\] do things like this. And all around us we've got them. . . . He \\[Ashok Kumar\\] stood on the kotha \\[roof of his house\\] and was watching from up there.\" When the Sikh women went to complain to him, he shouted, \"Go! Go!\" and ordered a kanjar called Tara, a mob leader, to bring sheets (chadars) and give them to them to use as shrouds. \"Tara is with Ashok, they're all his chamelias \\[flunkeys\\].\" \"Some of the participants were shopkeepers who supplied kerosene to the arsonists. Some others among the neighbors of the victims were petty traders like milkmen, mechanics, or dealers in cement. The majority of the victims were poor Sikh­merchants, artisans, and daily wage laborers.\"47 The behavior of the police was remarkably lax and partial. The sanctioned strength of the police on the Kalyanpuri police station, under which Trilokpuri falls\\[,\\] is 113, including one Inspector (who is the Station House Officer) and around 90 constables among others. The SHO reached Trilokpuri at about 2:30 P.M. on November 1 when the plunder and killings were taking place. The first thing he did was to remove the head constable and another constable from the spot, allowing the criminals to escape whatever little detection there was possible. It was a continuous spree of arson, rape, and murders after that. Later inquiries conducted by a senior police official revealed that at least four women, their ages ranging from 14 to 50 were gang Page 127 48 raped. Later seven cases of rape from Trilokpuri were officially reported by the J.P. Narayan Hospital, Delhi. In spite of the mounting reports of carnage and burning of entire blocks of houses, the headquarters police grossly underrepresented the number of deaths and declared that Trilokpuri was peaceful, while it was being reduced to cinders and practically all its menfolk had been killed and the women and children were fleeing for their lives. Faces in the Crowd Although many neighbors and friends, both Hindu and Muslim, gave shelter, refuge, and protection to the beleaguered Sikhs to the extent that it was possible and safe for them to do so, there is ample evidence that colony residents in the shape of Congress (I) activists, block leaders (pradhan), and higher officials of the Congress (I) Party were involved. Local Congress offices were frequently the sites for mobs assembling, for burning bodies, and for launching raids. Representatives of Congress (I) mobilized their local clients and thugs, provided them with liquor, and directed vendors of kerosene, the sale of which is restricted to permit holders, to distribute it. They also provided information about the targets—Sikh houses, business establishment permit holders, schools, and gurudwaras. Along with Gujjars and Jats from the villages bordering the settlement colonies, who had their own scores to settle, local \"low­caste\" supporters of Congress (I), such as Bhangis and Chamars, appear to have been readily available to form such organized mobs. Another set of participants, willing or forced, were bus drivers, such as those who worked for the Delhi Transportation Corporation (based in South Delhi). The evidence is solid that public vehicles were used to transport rioters from place to place. These mobile gangs, spreaders of rumors, shouters of slogans, instigators of violence among the public, acting as strike forces, were a critical element in the rapid sparking and spread of violence at key junctions of the city. The evidence is firm, too, that in the settlement colonies some police officers, especially station house officers, and police constables, were implicated in the riots, their collusion extending from inaction to absence. In the resettlement colonies, the police . . . directly participated in the violence against the Sikhs. We were told by survivors that at the first signs of tension those who felt threatened personally went to the nearby police stations to seek their intervention. But the police did not respond. In Trilokpuri, the police reportedly accompanied the arsonists and provided them with diesel from their Page 128 jeeps. The Station House Officer (SHO) of Kalyanpuri police station under which Trilokpuri falls, withdrew the constables who were on duty there when Sikh girls were being raped. Much later, the higher authorities took action against the SHO and his two colleagues by suspending and arresting them for a criminal negligence of duties. In Sultanpuri, the SHO, one Bhatti, is alleged to have killed two Sikhs and helped the mob in disarming those Sikhs who tried to resist the mob. 49 Who Are the Guilty? lists the occupations of some of those identified by informants as participants in the rioting, arson, and murder in the settlement colonies. Most were ordinary gainfully employed citizens, who constitute the majority of the local populace: a shopkeeper; a railway worker; a tailor; a mason; a dealer in cement; a TV shop owner; a video shop owner; a teashop owner; a furniture dealer; a Congress (I) pradhan; a Congress (I) worker; a meat shop owner; a dairy owner; a shoemaker; a grocery shop owner; a cloth and chappal (footwear) seller; a liquor seller; a sweeper; a rickshaw repairer; a milkman; a teacher; a cloth and tailoring shop owner; a landowner and goala (milkman); an auto­rickshaw driver; a kerosene seller; a property dealer; a carpenter; a mechanic; a vegetable seller; the owner of godown; a flour mill owner; a paper seller; a barber; the owner of three­star hotel; a dhoby (washerman); an opium dealer; a local goonda (thug). Lower­echelon Congress (I) workers, kerosene sellers, sweepers (low caste), and shopkeepers are the types that occur several times. All told, the riot participants, the vast majority of them Hindus, were a cross­section of the inhabitants one might expect to find in a settlement on the periphery of one of India's large cities. The Role of Congress The parts played in the 1984 Delhi pogrom against the Sikhs by lower­echelon Congress Party (I) activists, pradhans, and supporters, and in one case by a higher­ level politician, Dr. Ashok Kumar, who orchestrated the Trilokpuri horrors, have already been described. Kumar was by no means a maverick or an exception. There is evidence of the involvement of some members of the upper echelons of the Congress Party, including members of Parliament, members of the Delhi Metropolitan Council, and members of the Metropolitan Corporation. The Report on the Citizens' Commission asserts: Many who came forward to relate their experiences and provide eye­witness accounts to the Commission, have specifically and repeatedly named certain political leaders belonging to the ruling party. These included several MPs in Page 129 the outgoing Parliament, members of the Delhi Metropolitan Council and members of the Municipal Corporation. Scores of political functionaries in local areas or blocks and area pradhans were also named. They have been accused of having instigated the violence, making arrangements for the supply of kerosene and other inflammable material and of identifying the houses of Sikhs. Some of them have also been accused of interceding with the authorities to obtain the release of their followers who had been arrested for various crimes. 50 The authors of Who Are the Guilty? report the following evidence given by the residents of the settlement colonies whom they interviewed: We were told both by Hindus and Sikhs—many among the latter were Congress (I) supporters—that certain Congress (I) leaders played a decisive role in organizing the riots. Residents of Mangolpuri told us they saw Mr. Ishwar Singh, a Congress (I) Corporator among many others \\[whom the text mentions in an annex\\] actively participating in the orgy of violence. All these people were described by the local residents as lieutenants of the Congress (I) MP from the area—Sajjan Kumar. Similarly in Anand Parbat, Congress (I) councilors like Bhairava, Mahendra and Manget Ram, considered to be loyal followers of the Congress (I) MP, Mr. Dharamdas Shastri, were named as the main culprits. In Prakash Nagar, Congress (I) people were found carrying voters lists to identify Sikh households. In the Gabdhinagar area again, a local Congress (I) councillor, Sukhanlal, was identified by the victims as the main leader of the assailants. Escapees from the area who we met at the Shakarpur relief camp on November 6 blamed their Congress (I) MP Mr. H. K. L. Bhagat for having masterminded the riots.51 On November 1, Satbir Singh (Jat), a Youth Congress (I) leader, brought buses filled with people from Ber Sarai to Sri Guru Harikshan Public School at Munirka and burnt the school building and buses, and continued looting and assaults on Sikhs the whole night. Another group of miscreants led by Jagdish Tokas, a Congress (I) corporator, joined the above group in looting and assaults. In the Safdarjung­Kidwai Nagar area of South Delhi, eye witness accounts by those who stood in front of All India Medical Institute from where Mrs. Gandhi's body was taken out in procession on the evening of October 31, confirmed the presence of the Congress (I) Councillor of the area, Arjan Dass, at the time when the attacks on Sikh pedestrians, bus drivers, and conductors began. The allegations against these individuals repeatedly voiced by the residents of the respective localities which we visited, cannot be dismissed as politically motivated propaganda, since many among the Sikhs who accused them of complicity in the riots, had been traditionally Congress (I) voters.52 The official Misra Commission's indictment of \"anti­social\" and \"criminal\" elements as the main perpetrators of the riots and assessment of the role of the ruling Congress Party (I) have to be evaluated in the light of this kind of evidence. The Misra Commission report is a rich document to de­ Page 130 construct on this issue of culpability because at different points, it implicates different agents, while inadvertently disclosing its own preferences. Perhaps out of a sense of loyalty, it seeks not only to absolve higher­level members of the Congress Party but also to attribute an unconvincing \"split personality\" to those lower echelons of the party who joined ranks with the \"anti­socials.\" The report takes care to absolve the party as an institution and distinguish it from its low­level members. On the question of whether the riots showed \"organized violence,\" the Misra Commission report is unambiguous: \"It would not be wrong to say that there was organized violence at Delhi, and that it was done by the anti­social elements, and \\[that\\] in the riots, thousands of people who do not really belong to the classification of anti­socials did participate. Many of these participants were people from the lower ranks of the Congress (I) party and sympathizers.\" The commission was careful to specify that it could not ''draw a conclusion inferentially from the fact of participation of party workers and sympathizers or some leaders at local levels that the Party was involved in organizing what has been rightly called a carnage.\" 53 Having examined the relevant affidavits and cross­examined the accusing deponents, the commission concluded: \"All the material on the record in the ultimate analysis is not evidence of that type relying on which the Commission can record a finding that the Congress (I) Party or some leaders in that party had organized the violence which manifests in the shape of the riots.\" The report points out that the \"Congress (I) Party denounced the riots by regular resolutions adopted at official meetings of the party\" and that it had urged that \"the unity of India must not only be preserved and strengthened through tolerance and communal harmony but also good neighborly relations.\"54 The report then advances this extenuating argument: \"If the Congress (I) Party or some of its highly placed leaders had set the rioters to operate, one would expect the Sikhs with Congress base and affinity to have escaped the depredation.\" (This plea seems to be of dubious value, because in the Sri Lanka riots of 1983, the mobs destroyed the businesses and industrial properties and homes of Tamils in Colombo who were clearly well­known patrons of the UNP and had access to high­level UNP politicians. In fact, under the stress of the riots, the whole community of Tamils was the undifferentiated target, although some possible victims were saved by the protection money they had paid.) The Misra Commission's report resorts to tendentious sophistry when it comes to explain the motivations of the lower­level politicians and agents of the Congress Party. Admitting that it received plentiful written evidence Page 131 alleging that persons associated with the Congress (I)—such as workers, local leaders, and numbers of the youth wing—had been named as organizers of riot violence, the report is not only concerned once again to exonerate the party, but also resorts to the maneuver of splitting the party from the individuals belonging to it, and of differentiating between the \"public\" and \"personal\" involvements of the accused: \"These details supplied by DSGMC \\[the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee\\] fortify the conclusion that some of the Congress (I) party on their own had indulged and participated in the turmoil for considerations entirely their own.\" Not everyone who takes a dip in the Ganges is purified. Similarly, not everyone in Congress (I) is a Mahatma Gandhi. \"The party label . . . \\[does not\\] take away the individual element.\" The report, in this respect following conventional stereotyped allegations, repeatedly resorts to condemnation of so­called anti­socials, out for loot and impervious to the national tragedy, as the main culprits. \"The mob was jubilating and dancing,\" it observes. \"There was no sign of sorrow and grief on their faces. There were no mourners of the Prime Minister.\" It then gives this explanation for the crowd's euphoric and boisterous behavior: \"Anti­social gangsters obviously had no mourning to observe. The troubled atmosphere provided them with the opportunity to plunder and otherwise satisfy their animal desires and, therefore, the conduct exhibited . . . shows that the constituents of the mobs were the anti­social ruffians and usually not the people of Smt. Gandhi's camp or party who ordinarily were likely to exhibit mournful conduct.\" 55 At one point, the report forgets the evidence the Misra Commission had collected, charging that: \"The change in the pattern from the spontaneous reaction to organized riots was the outcome of the take­over of the situation by the anti­social elements.\"56 Such blanket denunciations miss the significance of the fact that a good cross­section of the ordinary population of Delhi participated; the report also does not know how to interpret the crowd euphoria, a problem that will be tackled later. The Conduct of the Police The Misra Commission did not flinch from taking to task the Delhi Police Force for its poor communication, tardiness in acting, and at times active connivance. \"There is abundant evidence before the Commission that the police on the whole did not behave properly and failed to act as a professional force,\" the report notes.57 The metropolitan city of Delhi is administered by the Home Ministry of the central government. The lieutenant governor is the chief adminis­ Page 132 trator and the police commissioner and police force are under his control. (There seems to be a sort of dyarchy, in that the home secretary of the Delhi administration appointed by the Home Ministry also shares in the administration of the city.) The strength of the police force in Delhi at the time of the riots was 22,000 constables, 3,000 head constables, 1,400 inspectors and sub­inspectors, and some 242 higher officers, culminating in the police commissioner. While it is widely recognized that the police force as a whole was inadequate in size to service the needs of a densely populated and growing city, it was not so thinly distributed that it could not have acted more positively than it did. The city was divided into five police districts, and it had sixty­three police stations and twenty­five police posts. The population of Delhi was roughly 6.5 million, and there was one policeman to roughly two hundred people. The Misra Commission records that the lieutenant governor of Delhi, the chief administrator of the city, testified: \"I am inclined to agree that there was a failure in the channel of communication between the local officers and the police and the district administration as also \\[at the\\] Commissioner's level.\" 58 It is noteworthy that the lieutenant governor during the riots, Shri Gavai, was chided by Rajiv Gandhi for not acting \"more swiftly in calling the army,\" and was thereafter removed from that position. Shri Gavai's answer was that a large number of members of the public who were bystanders would have been shot by the army as curfew breakers, and that this was politically unwise.59 Although apparently clear instructions had been given by the higher police authorities to those below, who were manning the police posts, with regard to the necessity of patrolling, inactivity and stonewalling were widespread among those so instructed. When contacted by telephone by the besieged Sikhs, police stations did not respond. \"The behavior of most policemen was \\[so\\] shabby that they allowed people to be killed, houses to be burnt, property to be looted, ladies to be dragged and misbehaved \\[with\\] within their very presence. Their plea was that they were few and could not meet the unruly armed mob \\[consisting\\] usually of hundreds or thousands.\"60 Two major charges against the police were substantiated, despite the Delhi administration's stubborn attempt to defend police conduct and paper over its shortcomings. The first was the poor communication from the lower levels of the force on the ground to their superior officers, situated in allegedly nodal information­ receiving and order­transmitting offices. The police commissioner, Tandon, told the Misra Commission that Page 133 there had been a failure on the part of the lower echelons of the force at local police stations to report the mob destruction and killing to their five district police control rooms, let alone to higher levels. Other superior officers made the same charge. One of the worst areas of arson, looting, and slaughter was Kalyanpuri (of which Trilokpuri is a section), twelve kilometers from police headquarters. On the night of November 1, more that two hundred people died there. But the additional commissioner of police for the area (there are six such officers immediately below the police commissioner) claimed that he did not hear about this massacre until sixteen to eighteen hours afterwards (that is, 7:00 P.M. on November 2). Such poor information, usually underestimating and underreporting the extent of the disorder and destruction, was only reluctantly passed up to the highest levels, with grievous consequences. In due course, the commissioner of police reported to the lieutenant governor of Delhi that only 20 to 30 deaths had taken place in Trilokpuri, and only 30 to 40 in Palam Colony, when the actual numbers were more like 260 and 300, respectively. Behind this story of tardy misreporting lurk these structuring forces: the hierarchy of social distance and powers that separates constables from officers; the fear of underlings reporting bad news that might reflect their inefficiency; and the bonds of sympathy that must have existed between the lower ranks of the police and their civilian public. The second major substantiated charge against the Delhi police involved instances of police collusion with the rioters, by acts both of omission and commission. In addition to the condemnations in the Misra Commission Report already cited, one further charge was that the police systematically attempted to take away licensed firearms from Sikhs, while not similarly disarming Hindus. The weaker minority group was thus exposed to the full armed strength of the rioters (see figure 5). 61 The report also lists these allegations, which it did not attempt to contradict: that police stood by and did not clear the way when mobs blocked fire engines; that police in uniform marched behind or mingled with the hostile crowds; and, worse still, that the police method of recovering looted materials was to invite the culprits to pile up their loot and leave, a procedure that not only exonerated looters who voluntarily surrendered goods but also caused a great mix­up of property, as well as further stealing from the standing piles. The farce of allowing recovered stolen property to be stolen again was only bettered by one last charge—that in some instances uniformed policemen participated in the looting. The police at higher levels did not participate in the riots, the report concluded, and cited instances of heroic and courageous actions by officers in Page 134 Figure 5 Police chasing a Sikh truck driver accused of driving his vehicle into a crowd and killing some people at the Bangla Sahib Gurudwara in Delhi during the 1984 riots. Bhavan Singh (India Today). rescuing Sikhs or helping them to escape. But it summarily dismissed the defensive pleas of the police authorities and the Delhi administration that the extant legislation (such as the Delhi Police Act of 1978, which incorporated older and outdated provisions contained in the Punjab Police Rules of 1934) was inadequate to deal with major disorders. It remarked that the so­called \"spontaneous national outburst\" after Indira Gandhi's death had not manifested itself in most parts of India, and that the Delhi police force of some 30,000, although insufficient, was not totally inadequate to deal with the riots. Furthermore, since such riots had taken place before, the plea of surprise and unpreparedness could not be invoked: \"By October 1984 riots had become too frequent in India, and under the excuse or cover of every possible plea based upon economic, religious, political, and social issues, society was being victimized by riots. . . . Delhi and neighboring places had seen riots on more than one occasion.\" 62 The higher levels and superior officers of the Delhi police force were not taken off the hook altogether. The Misra Commission recommended that the conduct of delinquent police officers should be officially investigated by the Delhi administration and the police force. It also wryly recalled that the Marwah inquiry, launched by the Delhi administration to identify incidents of severe failure to act and negligence by police officers, had been Page 135 derailed by officers of the highest rank (a couple of deputy and additional commissioners of police) who were in charge of South and East Delhi. Allegations Against the Delhi Transportation Corporation Allegations had been made by various parties that buses belonging to the Delhi Transportation Corporation were seen transporting armed mobs, especially during the first two days of the riots. The DTC is a large organization. In 1984, it had about thirty depots for buses, distributed all over the city; its Central Communication Centre was located close to Pragati Maidan. In addition to the thousands of buses it owns, the DTC also uses private buses whenever the need arises. On November 1, when the greatest amount of destruction and violence took place, most DTC buses were plying the usual routes. By November 2, it seems, once the news of bus takeovers and diversions had become known, the DTC's buses were taken out of service. The verdict of the Misra Commission speaks for itself: Though the Corporation does not admit use of its buses for movement of rioters, the Commission is prepared to accept the material collected by the Investigating Agency and its conclusion that the route buses were forcibly diverted by the mobs to facilitate their movements and when the drivers found any opportunity to escape, they returned to the depot. There is no material to hold that the Corporation had extended any assistance to the rioters by allowing its buses to transport the rioters. 63 The Tale of the Affidavits Appendix 3 of the Report of the Misra Commission is labeled \"Classification of Affidavits Received in Delhi.\" Printed without comment, it invites commentary and some speculation. Table 2 shows the number of affidavits filed by Sikhs on behalf of Sikh victims and by non­Sikhs against Sikhs for selected areas, according to the police station/area of the city in which these affidavits originated, as well as the number of people alleged to have been killed. Some fascinating features emerge when these affidavits are scrutinized. We should remember that the Sikh population of Delhi (as estimated by the Misra Commission) was only 393,921, or 6.33 percent of a total population in the Union Territory of Delhi of some 6,215,406 (with 5,763,200 classified as urban and 452,206 as rural). The question arises of what relation we might expect between this demographic distribution and the number of affidavits presented by both sides to defend and rebut each other's charges. Page 136 Table 2 Affidavits Filed in Connection with the 1984 Riots, Selected Areas of Delhi Police Station/Area By Sikhs\\* By non­Sikhs, against Sikhs Total Affidavits Number of people killed Ashok Vihar Nimri Colony 9 38 47 1 Mangolpuri (Rohuri Complex) 29 81 110 60 Sultanpuri 33 66 99 108 Jahangiripuri 13 37 50 26 Ganathinagar 11 189 200 9 Nand Nagri 20 5 25 441 Kalyanpuri 68 144 212 196 Shakarpur 29 299 328 57 Krishna Nagar 20 242 262 22 Karol Bagh 19 50 69 — Pahar Ganj 1 64 65 1 Delhi Cantonment Sagar Puri; Palam 49 48 97 149 SOURCE: Based on information in Report of Justice Ranganath Misra Commission of Inquiry (New Delhi: S.N., 1986), appendix 3. Sixty­nine police station/areas are enumerated by the report, from which the above areas were selected. A total of 2,894 affidavits were received, of which 628 were submitted by Sikhs on behalf of victims and 2,266 by non­Sikhs against the riot victims. The total number of people killed was 2,894. \\*On behalf of Sikh riot victims, alleging killing, arson, shooting, etc. Another fact to bear in mind is that the Misra Commission was authorized to be constituted in late April 1985, some five months after the riots had occurred. Its hearings, which actually began later, were not concluded with regard to Delhi for another year. The affidavits show that even after a time lag of this length, both Sikhs and non­Sikhs, victims and aggressors, were still disputing as to what had happened in the 1984 riots. The antagonisms had obviously not withered away. In those areas of Delhi where the Sikhs had suffered most in terms of killing, arson, and looting—areas such as Mangolpuri, Sultanpuri, Kalyanpuri, and Shakarpur— the number of affidavits filed by non­Sikhs against Sikhs, contesting their charges and making countercharges, was larger by a Page 137 proportion of three or four to one than the number of affidavits filed by the Sikhs against the aggressors. Delhi Cantonment, a disaster area, where the numbers of affidavits filed by both sides were roughly equal, is an exception. In some areas, such as Ganathinagar and Pahar Ganj, which I take to be overwhelmingly non­Sikh, a great number of affidavits were filed against Sikhs, while only a very few were filed by Sikhs. Moreover, there were hardly any instances of killings and arson in these areas. This suggests a determination on the part of non­Sikhs, through organizational representations, to resist being cast as culpable aggressors, to reduce the blame attachable to them, and, indeed, to turn the tables and even represent the victims as the aggressors. It is disturbing to think that dominant majorities can carry on such campaigns of vilification against vulnerable minorities and seek to erase the record and deny the nature of their collective violence. Concluding Comments Even when the suddenness and the emotional trauma of Indira Gandhi's assassination are taken into account, the evidence is clear that at least from November 1 on, the destructive actions of the mobs at various points in the metropolis of Delhi, and especially in its settlement colonies on the periphery, were encouraged, directed, and even provisioned by Congress (I) politicians, activists, and supporters, and indirectly aided by an inactive, cooperative police force. The distinguished political scientist Rajni Kothari, who was on the spot during the riots, maintains that there was a \"large measure of advance planning and rehearsing,\" and that \"soon after Operation Blue Star and the extremist response thereto in parts of Punjab, a plan of identifying Sikh targets ranging from households to commercial establishments to Gurudwaras had been undertaken, including the planning of logistics and the techniques to be employed. Both a psychology and a technology of 'revenge' had thus been blue­printed before the assassination provided the moment to carry it out.\" To substantiate this charge, Kothari points to evidence of an organized system for distributing kerosene, gasoline, and combustible chemical powders to all parts of the city with which to burn bodies and set ablaze trucks and buildings. \"There was evidence of men on scooters locating the places followed by mobs who carried out the killings and the arson, in many areas supervised by higher­ups moving in Ambassador cars from one place to another. . . . The synchronization of logistics and the striking similarity of technique\" points to a large measure \"of advance planning and rehearsing.\" 64 Page 138 Kothari was admittedly an outspoken critic of the Indira Gandhi regime. Much in what he says is reminiscent, however, of the 1983 riots in Colombo, about which evidence has been steadily mounting of prior collection of vital information, organizing of gangs, and so on, pointing to governmental involvement. In Delhi, the police either absented themselves from scenes of violence, passively looked on, or even directly participated; moreover, they handled the rioters whom they arrested leniently and connived in their early release. One writer has alleged that most of the lower cadres of the Delhi police were \"drawn from Haryana Jats who have all along been anti­Sikh.\" 65 In South Delhi, DTC buses were used by mobs to move from place to place igniting acts of violence; the participation of bus drivers and the use of government vehicles are prima facie evidence of either administrative assent or inability to take preventative action. Finally, the official media transmitted inflammatory information and news, thereby adding to the heightening of collective passions that demanded \"blood for blood.\" Who Are the Guilty? points an accusatory finger at the highest officers responsible for the administration of Delhi, such as the home minister and the lieutenant governor, for foot­dragging in regard to calling in the army, for propagating inaccurate information concerning casualties, for claiming the situation to be under control prematurely, and for delayed action in regard to relief measures. \"The Congress (I) High Command's reluctance to probe into the allegations against their own councilors and other leaders further lends credence to the suspicions voiced above. Even Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi seems to dismiss the serious charges being levelled against his party men.\"66 In any case, there seems to have been little coordination between the Delhi administration, the police, and the army. \"Surprisingly, there was no central control point. The Administration functioned from Old Delhi, the police from Indraprastha Estate and the army from the Cantonment.\"67 Since Indira Gandhi's death raised the problem of succession and the necessity of going to the polls soon afterwards, the \"managers\" of the state, the technocrats, and the ruling party's politicians seem to have exploited the assassination and the ensuing conditions by directing and staging organized violence against the Sikhs, thereby ensuring a Hindu vote in their favor. \"Hindu ekta Zindabad\" (Long Live Hindu Unity), \"Khoon ka badla khoon\" (Blood for blood) and \"Hindu­Hindu bhai bhai\" (the brotherhood of Hindus) were potent slogans. In the ensuing elections, Rajiv Gandhi was elected in a landslide vote to succeed his slain mother. In July 1985, he signed an accord with one of the Page 139 Akali Dal leaders, Harchand Singh Longowal. But by August, Longowal had fallen to the bullets aimed by Sikh \"extremists\" at Sherpur gurudwara, near Sangur in Punjab. The accord promised the transfer of Chandigarh to Punjab, with a corresponding transfer of certain areas—Fasilka and Abohar—to Haryana. In the Punjab assembly elections in September 1985, the Akali Dal­L, headed by Surjit Singh Barnala, was handsomely elected to power, but there was no progress toward implementation of the terms of the accord. The Akali Dal itself was riven by factionalism, and groups opposed to the ruling section formed their own Unified Akali Dal. The continuing strife and violence gave reason for president's rule to be imposed on Punjab once more in May 1987. Bhindranwale's Fundamentalism and Militancy: Religion, Politics, and Violence To what extent is the Sikh religion as such integral to the Sikh politics reviewed above, and a contributor to the \"ethnic conflict\" between Sikhs and others, whether these be Hindus, non­Sikh Punjabis, Congress politicians, or the Indian government? Before going any further, it is important to specify that there have been and are Sikhs who do not think religion and politics should mix (the \"secularists,\" by one Indian definition associated with Nehru), or who have not participated in separatist politics. What I have to say therefore can apply only to those who have been close adherents of the Akali Dal movement, and of fundamentalist movements such as the one led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. It should be evident that the makeup and course of Sikh history enacted by those identified earlier as the primary actors in recent times demonstrates (in the same way my writings on Sri Lankan Buddhism have maintained) that it is not possible or meaningful to disentangle or differentiate a domain of exclusively \"religious\" concerns from the political, social, and economic concerns of the Sikh community and the preoccupations of individual Sikhs with issues of identity and self­respect. Bhindranwale's movement, informed by his distinctive brand of religious fundamentalism and militant politics, might be an instructive phenomenon to scrutinize as an example of the entwining of religion and politics to form a total complex. Such scrutiny also sheds light on the efficacy and moral accountability of collective violence inspired by radical concerns as a mode of political action and political discourse. Page 140 Bhindranwale's fundamentalism fused religious and political concerns and aspirations on behalf of the Sikh community, whose identity and destiny were taken to be inseparably linked with its commitment to the Sikh faith and its practices. 68 Harjot Oberoi has recently made the significant observation that the Punjabi word mulvad is a linguistic equivalent of ''fundamentalism,\" and that \"Sikh journalists, essayists, and politicians, in discussing contemporary religious and political movements, now constantly use the term mulvad, connoting a polity and society organized on the basis of religious (particularly scriptural) authority.\"69 Before describing Bhindranwale's movement, let me specify what I see as some of the main ingredients of \"religious fundamentalism\" in the modern context. They are (1) a selective emphasis on and a univocal exegesis of certain precepts tendentiously taken from a canonical corpus that is usually more complex, more multivalent, less bounded, and less narrow than the fundamentalists' reading of it; (2) an exclusionary, separatist, and antagonistic attitude, rather than a coalescing and tolerant stance, toward other sects and traditions within the same religion, let alone other religions; and (3) the advocacy of a set of practices and a program of objectives that fuse the congregation's religious concerns of faith and salvation with its sociopolitical existence and interests as a \"nationality\" or \"ethnic group.\" These concerns and objectives also imperatively demand separation from and vigilance against other such religiopolitical communities, which are seen as threatening the purity of customs and endangering the well­being of the community in question. In the contemporary context, there is also a strong rejection of, and antagonism toward, the corrosive and deracinating influences of \"modernization\" and \"modernity,\" which are seen as accompaniments of Western industrialism and imperialism and global capitalism. Consumerist values, changes in clothing and hair styles, and in forms of recreation, ranging from the cinema to dance halls, smoking, and drinking to easy interaction between the sexes—these are taken to be the visible behavioral indices and traces of a deeper malaise. This rejection of modern consumerism is usually coupled with an attack on the urbanized middle classes, who have been most influenced by Western ideas, technology and \"secularist\" attitudes, and, simultaneously, with an espousal of the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Fundamentalist movements that envision a new society on earth become focused on charismatic leaders who embody and preach the message of revival and reform, and who advocate commitment to struggle and martyrdom in order to strive for the ideal order. A rhetoric of uncompromising struggle for this pristine order is deployed. Page 141 Mark Juergensmeyer has culled extracts from Bhindranwale's speeches and sermons that eloquently convey his orientation to the world as inspired by his distinctive commitment to the Sikh religion. When the press and other critics accused him of being an extremist, Bhindranwale explained what sort of extremist he was: \"One who takes the vows of faith and helps others take it; who reads the scripture and helps others do the same; who avoids liquor and drugs and helps others do likewise . . .; who says, 'respect your scriptures, unite under the flag, stoutly support the community, and be attached to your Lord's throne and home.'\" External enemies posed an ever­present danger: \"In order to destroy religion, on all sides and in many forms mean tactics have been initiated.\" Sikhs must defend the faith: \"Young men: with folded hands, I beseech you. . . . Until we enter our home, until we have swords on us, \\[the kaccha—warrior's knee­length drawers\\] on our bodies, Guru's word on our tongues, and the double­edged sword in our hands, we shall get beatings.'' Fully conscious of the fact that the Sikh religious tradition applauds nonviolence and forbids the taking of human life, except in certain extreme circumstances, when social or spiritual justice is at stake, Bhindranwale asserted: \"For a Sikh it is a great sin to keep weapons and kill anyone . . . \\[but\\] it is an even greater sin to have weapons and not seek justice.\" There could be \"no deliverance without weapons\" being used, he said: \"It is a sin for a Sikh to keep weapons to hurt an innocent person, to rob anyone's home, to dishonour anyone or to oppress anyone. But there is no greater sin for a Sikh than keeping weapons and not using them to protect the faith.\" Bhindranwale's sermons powerfully moved his followers because he simultaneously inspired and aroused guilt and tension and the urge to act at two levels—at the level of the interior lives of individuals who had betrayed norms or become lax about religious practices, and at the level of the Sikh collectivity, which had let itself be \"enslaved\" by the Hindu majority, by the Delhi politicians (although he did not spell out in detail the nature of this slavery). The renovation of the self was indissolubly linked to the redemption of the community. Reminding his audience that a great Sikh martyr had said, \"Even if I have to give my head may I never lose my love for the Sikh faith,\" Bhindranwale railed against Sikh officials and modernized youth: \"I am sorry to note that many people who hanker after a government position say instead, 'even if I lose my faith, may I never lose my position.' And our younger generation has started saying this: 'even if I lose my faith, may a beard never grow on my face' . . . If you find the beard too heavy, pray to God saying . . . 'we do not like this Sikhism and manhood. Have mercy on us. Make us into women.' \" 70 Page 142 In underscoring the special and separate identity of the Sikhs, proclaiming the inseparability of politics from religion, and envisaging a separate state for the Sikhs alone, Bhindranwale espoused causes that had also been voiced by many Akali Dal leaders, and before them by the Tat Khalsa and Singh Sabha advocates of the late nineteenth century. His distinctiveness and the powerful impact he had on his followers, especially the insecurely placed youth, who saw the doors of establishment closed against them, had to do with the manner in which he revived certain militant traditions associated with the sixth guru, Hargobind (1595–1644), and the tenth guru, Gobind Singh (1666–1708), and made them the vehicle of internal religiosity, personal identity, and collective Sikh destiny. In 1699, Guru Gobind Singh had instituted the Khalsa (the purified or the chosen) as the order of baptized Sikhs; they were to call themselves Singh (lion) and wear the five \"k's\"—kés (unshorn hair), kangha (wooden comb), kada (steel bracelet), kaccha (knee­length drawers worn by warriors), and kirpan (sword). These physical markers of separation from Hindu and Muslim and the badges of a brotherhood of right practices would have a remarkable imprinting role in Bhindranwale's campaign to purify the Sikhs and to enable them to regain faith. As T. N. Madan puts it: \"The religious beliefs that were singled out by Bhindranwale above all others were, first, the inseparability of religion and the state on politics, tracing this teaching to the sixth guru, Hargobind, and second, the indivisible or corporate character of the Sikh, deriving it from the praxis of the tenth guru, Gobind.\" 71 These elements selectively emphasized militancy as righteous action, and comprised a narrow part of the Sikh religious doctrine, whose first five guru propounders never handled arms. But the elements chosen were reminders of a time in the past when Sikhs had been besieged, and they were seen now as necessary instruments for them to preserve and protect their boundaries in the present time of similar danger. Bhindranwale seems to have both enlivened and energized the charged imagery of the two swords and more deeply inscribed it on the very bodies of his followers. Tradition has it that the sixth preceptor, Guru Hargobind, who challenged the hegemony of the Mughal state, \"broke with the convention that the guru should concern himself solely with spiritual pursuits. He tied round his waist two swords, one to symbolize miri (politics) and the other piri (spirituality).\"72 The doctrine of miri­piri pronounces \"the indivisibility of religious and political power, and of the spiritual and the temporal\" and gives \"legitimacy to the political organizer from within Darbar Sahib\" (the Golden Page 143 Temple). \"Miri piri is indeed so fundamental that it receives material concretization in the nishan, or Sikh emblem, in which the double­edged sword representing the purity of faith is shielded by two protecting kirpans (swords).\" 73 This emblem has in time incorporated other additional values. \"Sikhs often interpret the two edges of the sword as symbolizing spiritual and worldly foes, and they say that the battle sword (kirpan) . . . that Sikhs are supposed to wear at all times symbolizes an awareness of these same enemies.\"74 It is noteworthy that at the last stages of his career, Bhindranwale wore two swords in the manner of Guru Hargobind, thereby metonymically indexing the emblem to his body, and perhaps even iconically imaging it. The concept of miri­piri similarly justifies Sikh support for an independent political party,75 and ultimately also the goal of Khalistan as a separate religiopolitical sovereignty. There are two additional components of the Bhindranwale message that so compellingly attracted his following from 1978 to 1984, which, although composed of a variety of persons of different economic, cultural, and political backgrounds, was predominantly drawn from those who were, as Oberoi puts it, \"at the bottom of the social ladder.\" One component was the exciting promise of a Khalistan that would eradicate social inequalities, disallow the exploitation of the weak, especially those living in \"the backward village community,\" erase ''segregation of humanity, based upon caste, jati \\[subcaste\\], birth, locality and colour,\" and forbid \"cruel and distasteful practices\" prevailing between Sikh males and females. These were some of the objectives proclaimed by the Panthic Committee that announced the formation of the Sikh homeland of Khalistan on January 26, 1986. In the 1980s and early 1990s, other fundamentalist organizations, such as the Damdani Taksal, which was at this time led by Bhindranwale, made similar critiques of inequalities in the distribution of wealth and resources. At one public meeting in 1986, jointly sponsored by the Damdani Taksal and the All­India Students Federation, the collective resolution passed by the assembly enthusiastically asserted the need to break \"the chains of slavery\" that shackled the Sikhs, namely, internal social inequality, exploitation whereby the produce of the poor was sold at low prices, while the goods they bought were high­priced, and domination by the external Hindu majority, which inferiorized them.76 The goal of an egalitarian brotherhood of Sikhs was coupled with a millenarian vision. Oberoi states that \"for much of their history, at least since the rise of the Khalsa, Sikhs have opted to deal with major social crises—state oppression, economic upheavals, colonialism, collapse of semiotic cat­ Page 144 egories—by invoking the millenarian paradigm,\" and that central to this propensity has been \"a prophetic figure of extraordinary charisma with the will to establish an alternative social system in which oppression would cease and people would lead a life of harmony, purity, and good deeds. Bhindranwale was heir to his cultural tradition.\" 77 Bhindranwale knew little about economics or parliamentary politics, but he phrased the complex problems faced by Sikhs in terms of a crisis resulting from \"the religious depravity now prevailing among the Sikhs and the ever­increasing Hindu domination over the Sikhs,\" and called on the faithful to participate in the dharma yuddha (righteous battle, holy war) in which good was pitted against evil and only one side could be victorious. This apocalyptic vision—a final solution that was a leap into an unrealistic transcendental future—was apparently voiced in an eighteenth­century millenarian quatrain that asserted: \"The army of the Guru will sit on the throne of Delhi. . . . The Khalsa will rule, their enemies will be vanquished.\" Bhindranwale echoed this vision of future deliverance—an unrealistic fantasy for a minority that constituted only 2 percent of India's population—in his sermons. Bhindranwale's admonitions, accusations, and urgings combine a beleaguered sense of Sikh vulnerability, and a corresponding need for vigilance, with an empowering activist sense of martial and spiritual conquest as the road to salvation. Other gurus of the past championing Sikh objectives had been slaughtered by the Moghuls. The glory of Ranjit Singh's empire had been brief. There is a disquieting theme that woefully reveals itself as one follows the path of Bhindranwale's cause. Bhindranwale senses that he will be a martyr. While his martyr's cause is couched in the compelling language of an ultimate struggle against an imperfect world, it is also driven by the rhetoric and the actions of a beleaguered and trapped animal, whose resort to desperate armed violence has turned him into an irredeemable criminal, guilty with his followers of arbitrarily, impulsively, and vengefully killing many Sikhs and Hindus. The dharma yuddha had turned into a demonic bloodbath, in which hero and villain could not be differentiated. If this was the dissolution of a yuga, where were the signs of a regenerative new world cycle? The Golden Temple of Amritsar, so named after its gold­plated dome, had in time become a complex with a dual ordering. The Golden Temple itself, standing in the middle of a sacred tank, was originally built around 1606, by Guru Arjan and his followers. It is a place for congregational praying and for listening to readings from the Sikh holy book, the sole object of worship in a religion opposed to idolatry. Arjan's son and successor, Guru Page 145 Hargobind (1595–1644) built a second temple, the Akal Takht (the throne of the immortal God) facing the Golden Temple and standing outside the sacred tank and made it his political headquarters for challenging Mughal power. 78 The Akal Takht houses the traditional weapons associated with the sixth and tenth gurus. Inside the Akal Takht, \"instead of chanting hymns of peace, the congregation heard ballads extolling feats of heroism, and instead of listening to religious discourses, discussed plans of military conquests.\"79 The rituals and recitations of the two temples thus enact the two strands of the Sikh heritage, which are continuously reenacted in worship and enduringly shaped in stone and space. Bhindranwale and his followers, armed to the teeth, occupied the Akal Takht, the repository and reminder of Sikh martial deeds. They turned it into a fort of last resistance and were destroyed there by the Indian Army. Among the generals directing the attack were two Sikhs. But the attack on the temple horrified the vast majority of Sikhs, including those who did not condone or participate in Bhindranwale's politics. Spurning the repairs to the Akal Takht made by the Indian government, Sikhs have demolished it in order to rebuild it with their own labor. The two temples of the complex will no doubt stand again to proclaim the duality and complementarity of the Sikh legacy and its orientation to the world. But what do we infer from the failure of Bhindranwale's pursuit of Sikh spiritual and political deliverance through fundamentalist violence? And to what extent is the emergence of the juggernaut of so­called Hindu nationalism dialectically related to militant Sikh separation? Sikh Identity and the Boundary Problem The Sikh community or collectivity, popularly called the Panth in the Punjabi language, is by no means monolithic: they have been, and are even today, \"divided by geography, ethnicity, social hierarchy, sects, ritual practices, and individual preferences. Consequently, when it comes to political participation, Sikhs have never been represented by a single political party.\"80 The two major political parties that Sikhs have supported are the Congress Party and the Akali Dal (which is exclusively Sikh); the religious and political agendas of other organizations, such as the SGPC, the Dal Khalsa, and the Damdani Taksal, have, however, further crosscut and differentiated the Panth. Even as a religious collectivity, the Sikhs have had no \"organized vertical hierarchy\" to bind them, and several texts have functioned in the past as manuals of conduct (rahit­nama). In manifesting different subtraditions, Sikhism participated in the religious milieu characteristic of other Indian religious collectivities. Moreover, Sikh transactions Page 146 have been regulated and adjudicated according to Punjabi customary law, and further supplemented and amplified by Anglo­Saxon law as it was applied and interpreted piecemeal during the colonial and postcolonial periods. These are some of the features that point to a Sikh predicament articulated from time to time by various Sikh leaders—the lack of unambiguous markers of Sikh identity that would set them apart, especially vis­à­vis the Hindus, whom they see as \"threatening\" to incorporate or assimilate them. In the late nineteenth century, the Tat Khalsa movement coped with this issue and tried to stipulate the practices, rituals, and markers of an exclusive Sikh identity. An important thrust of Bhindranwale's campaign was also to erase these ambiguities. 81 Sikh fundamentalists would like to see a code of Sikh personal law enacted, although in practice this has proved to be difficult. Bhindranwale urged all Sikhs to undergo the Khalsa amrit ceremony and to uphold the five k's. He toured the countryside extensively, urging the youth to be initiated and saying, \"Only people without ambiguity in their heart have the right to call themselves Khalsa.\" And his punitive action against the Sant Nirankaris can also be interpreted as an attempt to stamp out a sectarian tendency that diluted religious practice in the direction of Hindu worship. While Bhindranwale was the most recent reiterator of the Sikh identity issue, the issue itself is an entrenched one, and is likely to be a major ongoing concern to the Sikh collectivity. This concern is most likely exacerbated by the recent upsurge of Hindu nationalism and the campaign to demolish the Muslim Babri Masjid in Ayodhya and to build a temple to Ram in its place. Polarized Violence and the Passage to Civil War In 1989–90, in the southern, southwestern, and central parts of Sri Lanka, polarized violence—that is, violence committed by armed gangs or groups, paramilitary agents, official security forces, and insurgents battling one another in the midst of a bewildered, fear­ridden, helpless civilian population—had reached a climax.82 Happenings similar to those in Sri Lanka were a continuing nightmare in the Punjab in 1990–91. In Sri Lanka, both the security forces of the state and the insurgents, the JVP, employed death squads, as well as unidentifiable gangs, to conduct assassinations. They would leave the corpses burning on the street, floating down a river, or tied to lampposts. This signifies organized violence as the order of the day and as a principal mode of enacting politics, through which power is produced, acquired, and employed in a theatricalized and repetitive manner. Page 147 Violence took the form of revenge killings. Some killings were targeted in the sense that certain known opponents were singled out and ambushed; others were arbitrary, in that they were randomly carried out against innocent civilians, who by virtue of the contagion of being fellow villagers or relatives of the enemy were punished or killed just to spread intimidation. The killers justified these acts as \"preventive\" measures against anticipated collusion on the part of the victims. Violence spread like an epidemic, infecting and killing without warning and seemingly at random. The population at large frequently did not know whether the kidnappings, disappearances, and killings were motivated by public political calculations or reasons of private vendetta. When a JVP suspect was killed, a net of guilt by association was cast, endangering the lives of his associates, his kinsmen, his fellow villagers. A report written on behalf of International Alert entitled Political Killings in Southern Sri Lanka documents instances of \"the total helplessness created where there is an assumption that the threat comes from some section of the guardians of law and order themselves, at times under cover of curfew.\" 83 On the one hand, this state of chronic public violence breached the bounds of civil order: there was no right of complaint or of litigation; no possibility of appeal to habeas corpus or judicial procedure. But on the other hand, in becoming routinized and normalized, this violence constituted a new arena of social action, a theater of violence, with its signals and its semiotic logic, its raids, shootings, hangings, shamings, warnings, and threats posted on walls and shop doors. The people at large surreptitiously recognized the messages but did not publicly discuss them; they responded to the call to strike by staying away from work and by shutting shops. The threats of violence and punishments thus produced nonviolent compliance among the civilian populace. The Reign of Terror in the Punjab, 1990–1991 In the Punjab in 1990 civilians, both Hindu and Sikh, were victimized by the police, the army, and the Sikh militants. Some of these last were no different from criminal gangs, looting and killing in the name of holy war, but making of that war a parasitic mode of livelihood. V. S. Naipaul's poignant and empathetic account of the grieving condition of Sikh families, in a state of shock, and caught up in the crossfire of intrigue, divided loyalties and shifting alliances is worth citing: When terror became an expression of faith, the idea of seva \\[service, one of the good and poetic concepts of Sikhism\\] was altered. Page 148 Now five years after the assault on the temple, the terrorists lived only for murder: the idea of the enemy and the traitor, grudge and complaint, were like a complete expression of their faith. Violent deaths could be predicted for most of them: the police were not idle or unskilled. But while they were free they lived hectically, going out to kill again and again. Every day there were seven or eight killings, most of them mere items in the official report printed two days later. Only exceptional events were reported in detail. Such an event was the killing by a gang, in half an hour, of six members of a family in a village about ten miles away from Mehta Chowk. The two elder sons of the family had been killed, the father and the mother, the grandmother, and a cousin. All the people killed were devout, amritdhari Sikhs, that is, Sikhs who were initiated into the Khalsa. \\[The taking of amrit (nectar) is supposed to make you a member of the brotherhood of pure Sikhs, who will henceforth reject food not cooked by amritdharis; the initiation is said to help control the five evils: lust, anger, covetousness, ego, family attachments\\]. The eldest son, the principal target of the gang, had been an associate of Bhindranwale. But a note left by the gang, in the room where four of the killings had taken place—the note bloodstained when it was found—said that the killers belonged to the \"Bhindranwale Tiger Force.\" 84 The intergang warfare among the Sikh militants is itself seemingly an \"inevitable\" phase among insurgents today. In Sri Lanka, the Tamil militant groups, divided into a number of competing factions, turned on one another in the same way Sikh militants have done. But what Naipaul fails to record is the parallel violence of the security forces. Barbara Crossette, writing in the New York Times, vividly reports the dilemma of \"Punjabis, sandwiched between Sikh rebels and New Delhi\": Despite what Punjabis call \"police raj\" or armed rule in this state, where about 60 percent of the population is Sikh, thousands of people have died this year. A militant campaign of intimidation of state government employees and the press is daily more audacious, officials are assassinated, criminal gangs flourish and, most wrenching to the hard­working Sikh community, Sikhs have begun killing each other as divisions among them deepen. Up to 95 percent of the dead are Sikhs: militants, policemen, suspected informers and ordinary men, women and children. Crossette reports that \"Jagjit Singh Aurora, a retired lieutenant general and critic of Government handling of Punjab . . . who heads the civil­rights group, the Sikh Forum, blames government officials and the militants symbolized if not led by an underground organization called the Panthic Committee. 'The villager doesn't want to get robbed and killed by militants or criminals. . . . But the villager is also getting robbed and killed by the police.' Further militarization of the state, he said, will only create 'an actively hostile population.' Page 149 \"Sikh leaders say many families have already been alienated by officially sanctioned death squads and extortion by policemen who abduct young people and threaten to book them as terrorists if ransoms are not paid. Reports of torture and death in police custody are common.\" 85 The story of the widespread and endemic violence in Punjab did not stop here of course. The internecine and factional violence among the Sikhs, compounded by the police and army counteractions against the Sikh militants and civilians, was itself a smaller component of the larger scene, in which Sikh militants were constantly attacking and killing Hindu civilians. The following excerpt from a New York Times report typified hundreds of similar incidents: The authorities imposed an indefinite curfew today on a town in Punjab state after Sikh separatists shot 15 Hindus to death there in a new surge of political violence in India. The police in Chandigarh, the Punjab state capital, said 15 bodies were found in Jullundur after militants rode through the town in a car on Sunday firing assault rifles at Hindus. . . . In Jullundur, the curfew was ordered after Hindu crowds started gathering at a hospital to prepare for the cremation of the 15 bodies, the Chandigarh police said. They said that only a limited number of people would be allowed to attend the cremation rites. Sikh men \\[more accurately, many Sikhs\\] are easily distinguished by their full beards and turbans from the Hindus, who make up three­quarters of India's population of 850 million but are a minority in Punjab. The police said the attack may have been intended as a protest against the roundup of more than 300 Sikh politicians to prevent them from meeting on Sunday at Anantpur, near Chandigarh. More than 3,500 people—policemen, militants, politicians and ordinary citizens caught up in violence—have been killed so far this year in the Punjab violence. Chandra Shekhar, India's new Prime Minister, said today that he was willing to talk to any leader to try to ease India's political violence. He said the Sikh meeting in Punjab had to be banned because it would have increased religious polarization. New Delhi dissolved Punjab's state assembly three years ago and put the state under direct rule by a governor and bureaucrats in a vain attempt to quell the separatist violence.86 The Indian Elections of 1991 and Generalized Violence With rebellions convulsing Punjab, Assam, and Kashmir, and with political parties, the security forces, and militants all resorting to armed violence, the Hindu nationalism of the Bharata Janata Party (BJP) and the caste politics of V. P. Singh's National Front were explosive. The elections of 1991 Page 150 were unanimously rated by journalists as the most violent in India's postindependence history as a democracy. A spate of killings culminated in Rajiv Gandhi's assassination outside Madras, allegedly by Sri Lankan Tamil militants, as a result of which the elections were postponed, with the uncertain expectation of their being resumed a few weeks later. James Clad has sketched the violent context of the electoral campaign in India in late May 1991 as follows: Another election promises only further paralysis in which no one party wins a majority. Yet elections and parliamentary instability only hint at India's torn fabric. Topping the list are rebellions, convulsing the Punjab and Kashmir. . . . In Kashmir, especially, the degree of alienation between the 4 million Kashmiris and the security forces positioned in the beautiful valley is profound. I detected no shred of common ground between the populace and what has become an occupying force. Yet the retention of Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state, remains an article of faith for all Indian parties and politicians. . . . Nothing unites Indians more than the determination to \"hold\" Kashmir; nothing unites Kashmiris more than a desire to be rid of India, a tragic impasse that results mostly, but not entirely, from India's manipulation of Kashmiri politics during the last three decades. In the Punjab, a different logic yields the same grim result. . . . an original demand for a separate state for the majority Sikhs has now become a fratricidal rebellion in which Sikhs belonging to a score or more groups butcher each other. Predominantly Sikh policemen create new groups to fight the older groups. . . . The Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, India's Hindu revivalists, want to revive \"Hindu­ness,\" a glorious time before the Muslim and Christian invaders, but the prospect frightens the country's 110 million Muslims (after Indonesia, India is the most populous Muslim nation). . . . While the fracturing of national politics proceeds, so does the unraveling of civic peace. Riots between dominant Hindus and the big Muslim minority have ravaged communal harmony in recent months. Indian observers say the unrest is the worst since the 1947 Partition which split British India in two. . . . Many longstanding social issues have resurfaced with new bitterness, such as ethnic quarreling over retention of the English language; and the vexed issue of caste, fanned by controversial plans last year for an affirmative action program giving many government jobs to \"backward castes,\" a category distinct from caste \"untouchable.\" . . . . . . India remains wedded to perhaps the best legacy of British rule—the ballot box. Although politics have become deeply criminalized in some Indian states, governments change in Delhi and in its states through elections, not (as in Pakistan) through overt or disguised military coups. When observing elections I have seen both a mixture of textbook civics and ballot­box hijacking reminiscent of the Philippines. Still, it beats periodic shows of bayonets in the capital city. 87 Page 151 Appendix: Constructing a Sikh Identity One has to go back at least to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to fully comprehend Bhindranwale's religious impulsions and the cultural and religious capital he was drawing on and elaborating. Sikh history is characterized by a series of highly complex ruptures, rapprochements, and transitions. The concept of an exclusive Sikh identity, and of the Sikh collectivity as a separate one with definable boundaries, was not there from the outset. It was not fully dominant even in the latter part of the eighteenth century and in the early nineteenth century, at the time of Ranjit Singh's empire. The territories in which Sikhs lived, the languages they spoke, the agrarian festivals in which they participated, the ritual officiants they patronized, and the universe of their rites of passage—all these were shared with the other communities amongst whom they lived in the Punjab. This is not, of course, to deny that under the guidance and teachings of the Sikh gurus, certain identity markers and distinct practices and places of worship did develop: The initial Guru period, following the death of Nanak, provided significant axes of identity to the embryonic Sikh faith: allegiance to the person of Guru Nanak and his nine successors; identification with their teachings (bani); the foundation of congregations (sangats); the setting up of elaborate pilgrim centres at places like Goindwal and Amritsar; the convention of a communal meal (langar); and the compilation by Guru Arjan of an anthology, commonly known as the Adi Granth, which ultimately acquired the status of a major sacred text of the Panth. 88 This text compiled by the fifth guru, Arjan, in one sense turned the Sikhs into a \"textual community,\" and by the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, pious Sikhs were characterized by \"the centrality of belief and abiding faith in the person and utterances of the Sikh gurus; the need to visit the dharamsala \\[a monastic establishment or place for reading and singing scriptures\\]; and the repeated emphasis on the sangat as a body of practitioners in faith.\"89 But even so, at this time, the category \"Sikh\" was flexible and problematic, and the Sikhs were still in the process of growing and evolving. The collation of the Adi Granth did not create a firm separation of the Sikh Panth from other religious traditions. The voluminous hagiographical narratives (Janam­sakhi) of the life of Guru Nanak borrowed liberally from Puranic stories, Sufi hagiographies, and Buddhist Jatakas. The initial Guru period came to a sudden end with the execution of Guru Arjan by the Moghuls in 1606. \"A continuous Jat influx into the Sikh Page 152 movement throughout the seventeenth century alongside a protracted conflict with an increasingly hostile Mughal state gradually gave rise to new Sikh cultural patterns.\" One major development was the institution of the Khalsa by the last Sikh guru, Gobind Singh, in the last decade of the seventeenth century. \"The Khalsa \\[order or brotherhood\\] was instituted to finally end the ambiguities of Sikh religiosity,\" and the distinctive identity of the Sikh was \"inscribed through a complex cultural repertoire made up of inventive rituals, codes of conduct, mythical narratives and a whole new classificatory code regarding the body.\" 90 Initiation into the Khalsa involved the famous khande ki pahul rite of drinking sanctified water into which a double­edged sword was dipped. However, not all Sikhs became Khalsa; many, including Sikhs who were drawn from the Brahmin and Khatri castes, resisted Khalsa initiation and identity. The Khalsa continued its work of securing religious boundedness, and forged its own dharma (moral code), which it called Rahit. Oberoi underscores the importance of texts called Rahit­namas, which developed the Khalsa conception of selfhood by codifying five areas: life­cycle rituals, tabooed behavior, the implications of transgressions, and the constitution of sacred space. Since they were produced in the first three­quarters of the eighteenth century, the Rahit­namas serve to refute the idea that Khalsa identity only became dominant in the late nineteenth century under British sponsorship. By the second half of the eighteenth century, a distinctive Khalsa order had thus emerged. The Adi Granth assumed the status of the voice of an eternal guru, who was no different from God; and the Sikh gurus' teachings were the \"voice\" of God—they brought God and man together. The doctrine of Guru Granth was conjoined to the notion of Guru Panth: the guru was present wherever the Sikh congregation assembled. When, in 1708, at the death of Gobind Singh, there was no guru to succeed him, the Panth turned into his collective successor. During the course of the eighteenth century, tens of thousands of Sikhs, many of whom belonged to the \"lower social orders,\" embraced Khalsa identity, partly because of the Khalsa's campaign to displace the Mughal state in Punjab. By the 1770s, Khalsa Sikhs, who had formed regional political units called misls, which controlled certain territories and distributed hereditary land rents to functionaries, controlled the Mughal suba of Punjab and large portions of the provinces of Multan and Shahjahanabad. The solidarity infused through the rituals of gurmatta (resolutions passed by the faithful in the presence of the Adi Granth) and sarbat­khalsa (meetings of corporate bodies) was \"a crucial ingredient in the making of these Khalsa Sikhs.\"91 Page 153 But on the other hand, at the same time, the Khalsa was attaining greater control, there was acceptance in many circles that there were alternate ways of being a Sikh, and that ''the Sikh Panth was not coterminous with the Khalsa and it was possible to be a Sikh without being a Khalsa.\" 92 The Sikhs who did not turn into Khalsa Sikhs were by no means numerically insignificant, and in the mid eighteenth century, they were often referred to as the Sahajdharis (this label included Nanak­panthis as well as Udasis). In many ways, the Sahajdhari Sikhs inverted Khalsa categories of thought and practices and \"transgressed\" Khalsa religious boundaries. They cut their hair, did not undergo initiation, obeyed no norm to obligatorily carry arms, smoked tobacco, and had a radically different version of the line of succession from Guru Nanak. While \"Khalsa Sikhs began to recognize the Adi Granth as guru, Sahajdhari Sikhs were not given to accept a text as guru and favoured living human gurus.\"93 But they recognized Nanak as their guru and read and recited from the Adi Granth. The Udasis, perhaps the most conspicuous and numerous segment of the Sahajdharis, were organized in a number of major orders, managed shrines across north India, and set up their own establishments at major pilgrimage centers such as Amritsar, Hardwar, and Banaras. They did not consider the Khalsa Rahit­namas to be binding, and rather than the five k's, their outfit included a cap, a rosary of flowers, a cotton bag, a vessel made of a dried pumpkin gourd, a deerskin upon which to perform Hatha Yoga, and so on. There was a distinct difference in worldly orientations and involvement between the Khalsa and Sahajdhari Sikhs: the former thought of salvation as attainable while they pursued their pragmatic worldly objectives within the encompassing framework of religious beliefs and practices; the latter declared that secular pursuits were not compatible with the goal of human liberation, which required world renunciation. It is not surprising therefore that \"the Khalsa principalities, numbering more than two score in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, did not seek to dissolve preexisting social hierarchies. . . . Their main aim was to absorb the local segmentary lineages and found an empire on them.\"94 The processes of state formation that culminated in the Lahore state of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839) consisted of multiple accommodations: between the Khalsa Sikhs and the lineages and caste organizations; between the Khalsa and Sahajdhari Sikhs; and between Khalsa notions of exclusive Sikh identity and a more inclusive identity incorporating rituals associated with Hinduism and Hindu ritual specialists. \"It is this extraordinary fusion of Khalsa and non­Khalsa identities which marks out Sikh tradition in the eighteenth century from what was to follow under colonial rule.\"95 Page 154 By the early nineteenth century, there had crystallized what Oberoi calls the Sanatan Sikh tradition, which embodied a rapprochement between Khalsa and Sahajdhari identities. Although by the early twentieth century, this Sanatan tradition had lost its dominance, its complex intermingling of trends and rich hierarchized diversity make it noteworthy. The main text of the Sanatan tradition was the Dasam Granth, whose \"intertextuality\" was linked to the Puranas and Hindu epics such as the Mahabharata. Under its umbrella, Hindu priests publicly worshipped images within the precincts of the Golden Temple, and it was considered legitimate to worship living gurus, whose descendants inherited their charisma. The lineages descended from these Sikh gurus became known as Bedis, Trehans, Bhallas, and Sodhis. 96 Members of these guru lineages served as custodians of Sikh shrines, established monastic establishments, imparted religious instruction, dispensed charity, and took care of their family relics. But side by side with the saintly lineages who inherited charisma, there was also a lively tradition of holy men—the Bhais, Sants, and Babas—who achieved and earned their holiness in their lifetime. These holy men, recognized for their piety, were credited with powers to perform miracles, heal the sick, and succor the distressed. Sanatan Sikhism also included ascetic orders, such as the Udasis, Nirmalas, Gianis, Dhadis, and many others. In the mid nineteenth century, there were over 250 Udasi akharas (establishments). Although smaller in scale, the Nirmalas were an especially significant ascetic order, and many of their akharas engaged \"in meditation, yoga and in the study of the Adi Granth, the Vedas, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Puranas and the Sastras.\"97 The Udasi and Nirmala establishments were second only to the famous guru lineages among the recipients of religious grants from the Sikh state; they also undertook the task of propagating the faith and establishing branches and pilgrim centers on the periphery of the Sikh world. Their central establishments were famous for studying, creating, and diffusing both sacred and secular knowledge pertaining to the scriptures, literary classics, rhetoric, astrology, and medicine. Oberoi regards Sanatan Sikhism as primarily a \"priestly religion,\" whose dominance derived from its being \"the religious universe of Sikh elites\"; but it was an \"official religion\" closely aligned with the Sikh kingdom of Lahore, and it progressively lost strength and validity once the British annexed Punjab. The era of the loss of Sikh empire and the establishment of British Raj saw the spawning of the organizations called Singh Sabhas. The first of these was the Sri Guru Singh Sabha, formed in Amritsar in 1873. Al­ Page 155 though responsive to the changes injected into Punjabi society by British rule, it sought to preserve traditional cultural values and attempted to answer questions about Sikh identity, the differences between the Sahajdhari and Khalsa traditions, the place of low­caste Sikhs (e.g., Mazhabi and Chamar Sikhs) within the Sikh collectivity, and orthopraxy in the externals of physical appearance. The affluent intellectuals who led most of the early Singh Sabhas (the one at Lahore was formed in 1879) were pluralistic and inclusive in their attitudes and inclined toward Sanatanist tolerance of a variety of traditions. There was a phenomenal expansion of Singh Sabhas in the late 1880s (about 115 were formed between 1880 and 1900, the majority of them in Punjab), related to the increasing number of Sikhs responding to educational opportunities, the expansion in communications, commerce, and services, and the rise of new market towns and trading networks that also penetrated the rural economy. Physical and social mobility and expanding opportunities also brought new members into the ranks of the elite. Oberoi underscores the enormous transformation involved in the tolerant pluralism of Sanatan Sikhism giving way to the three \"core doctrines\" of the Tat Khalsa, guru, Granth, and gurudwara, which became \"the litmus test of authentic Sikhism\" and came to be widely accepted by the Sikh public in the early twentieth century. Arising in opposition to the prevailing Sanatan Sikh tradition and popular religion, the Tat Khalsa conducted persistent campaigns against the cult of saints (pirs), local festivals and agrarian fairs made merry with music, folk songs, and dance, and the worship of gods, local shrines, and ancestral spirits. \"Underwriting the Tat Khalsa's authoritative discourse were a series of factors: the colonial state, the British army, the collapse of customary culture, and the new political configuration in the localities,\" Oberoi observes. 98 In the late nineteenth century a growing body of Sikhs took part in a systematic campaign to purge their faith of religious diversity, as well as what they saw as Hindu accretions and as a Brahmanical stranglehold over their rituals. The result was a fundamental change in the nature of the Sikh tradition. From an amorphous entity it rapidly turned into a homogeneous community. And of all the competing entities, symbols and norms that went into constituting the long history of the Sikh movement, it was the Khalsa sampradaya that succeeded in imprinting its image on the \"new\" community. . . . The Udasis, Nirmalas—a motley complex of traditions referred to here as Sahajdharis—came to be seen as deviants. With the active displacement or subordination of many of the Sikh sub­traditions, a single Sikh identity began to crystallize in the first decade of this century.99 Page 156 The Tat Khalsa's drive to impose and inscribe an exclusive Sikh identity and to achieve a separatist collective identity shorn of Hindu influences and practices merits detailed consideration, especially the moves by which many strands of Sanatan Sikhism were displaced and inferiorized, thereby making the Tat Khalsa the clamorous center of Sikh tradition. \"Between 1880 and 1909 the body was made a principal focus of symbolic concern and a central means of projecting ideological preoccupations.\" 100 Although Guru Gobind Singh may have been the first within Sikh tradition to recognize the semiotic potential of the body to manifest the power of a corporate imagination, it took an interval of almost three centuries and a decisive intervention by Singh Sabha activists before this sign­vehicle was fully harnessed. . . . Scriptural truths and corporeal existence were made isomorphic and pointed to the same objective: Sikh corporate identity and the independence of the Sikh religious community. . . . The oft­repeated rhetorical statement \"Ham Hindu Nahin\" (We are not Hindus) now had a subjective basis; what it lacked was supplemented by further innovation.101 Oberoi shows how the Tat Khalsa combined its attempts to elevate the spiritual condition of its adherents with the strict regulation of their bodies. The Khalsa sought to impose a distinct physical appearance and identity on its followers by rigidly enforcing external symbols of identity, particularly the five k's, and formalizing new life­ cycle rituals, especially those pertaining to Khalsa initiation. In its rewritten hagiographies of martyrs, its popular tracts, and the new novels written by its literary members, the Khalsa emphasized how the heroic figures of the eighteenth century had been \"punished, tortured and killed for desiring to retain their cultural markers,\" and how \"the ideal Sikh modes of bodily comportment\" were exemplified by them.102 \"Only those who stuck to the glorious heritage of the heroic epoch deserved to be called Sikhs. In other words those who were minus the Five K's—for instance the Udasis, the Nirmalas and the Sahajdharis—were not Sikhs. They had failed to live up to the high standards of the past and therefore should be stripped of their rights to community membership.\"103 Bhindranwale's sermons some seven or eight decades later even more trenchantly restated these messages in colloquial idiom. The ways in which Sikhs belonged to the larger Hindu culture, especially their marriage practices, biradari (clan) norms, and life­cycle rites, such as weddings and funerals, and whether these customs put them in danger of being assimilated and encompassed, created a recurring problem for Sikh identity. In direct contrast to the Sanatan Sikh tradition of tolerance of diverse Sikh local family, kinship, and caste practices, the Khalsa Sikhs deliberately set out to declare \"Hindu\" (and \"Muslim\") adhesions Page 157 unorthodox. They worked to forge and invent new rituals, at whose core was the Adi Granth, the sacred object to be circumambulated and to be recited as sacred formulae. The great majority of Sikh households in the late nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth \"performed their rites of passage according to the long­ established conventions of customary culture or the respective customs of their biradaris and caste groups.\" Moreover, as may be expected \"there was an immense variation in ceremonial, not only among the different castes of Sikhs but also within caste groups and among Sikhs of different localities.\" The village nai (barber) and the local Brahmin purohit (priest) figured in Sikh life­cycle rites. \"Much as with marriage ceremonial, Sikhs lacked any distinctive mortuary rite that could be described as a charter of corporate identity.\" In the eyes of the Tat Khalsa, these practices \"were completely anti­Sikh in nature; they had brought about the degeneration of Sikhism and its increasing assimilation into Hinduism.'' 104 Between 1884 and 1915, many manuals were published on how Sikhs ought to arrange their life­cycle rituals. These new specifications, which played a fundamental role in etching Sikh cultural boundaries, while dispensing with earlier \"Hindu\" ritual functionaries, sought to standardize rituals for all Sikhs—Jats, Khatris, Mazahbis— shorn of any caste or biradari associations; made the Adi Granth the central sacred object (for example, replacing the fire in marriage rites) and sole text for recitation; and focused on the wearing of the five k's. These newly devised purified ritual injunctions were in due course inserted into the Rahit­namas, which sought to stipulate Khalsa conceptions of moral duties and proper ritual practices.105 In addition to these radical changes in life­cycle rituals, other innovations were introduced by the Tat Khalsa with regard to dress, language, the annual calendar and appropriate festivals, dietary taboos, and so on to strengthen the distinctions and socioreligious boundaries between Sikhs and non­Sikhs.106 A critical step taken with far­reaching implications was espousing the Punjabi language and the Gurmukhi script, in which the Adi Granth was written, as emblems and vehicles of Sikh identity.107 (The appropriation of Punjabi, with its implications for educational instruction, employment recruitment and administration, and its distinctness from Urdu and Hindi, the markers of Muslim and Hindu identity, inevitably fed into issues of linguistic nationalism and the carving out of linguistic states, which came to a head in postindependence times. The second partition of Punjab took place in 1966, with Haryana hiving off to form a separate state.) Oberoi has convincingly argued, especially against Richard Fox's thesis in his Lions of the Punjab (1985), that Sikh identity as we know it today Page 158 was not primarily or solely a creation of and reaction to colonial policies of the Raj. There was an anterior trend and legacy in precolonial Sikh tradition, especially as it came alive in the eighteenth century in the Rahitnama literature and ritual prescriptions, which enunciated a Sikh identity \"similar to the one promulgated by the Singh under the Tat Khalsa (what Fox terms the 'Singhs' or the 'Lions')\" and insisted that the Khalsa Sikh must \"maintain the external symbols of his faith.\" 108 This antecedent Khalsa legacy was reactivated and reformulated in the late nineteenth century, and the Sikh internal dialogue and tensions between Sahajdhari nonacceptance of the Khalsa code and the tolerant pluralistic Sanatan tradition, on the one hand, and the reformist, \"rationalizing\" drive of the Tat Khalsa, on the other, cannot be reduced to the stimulus of British rule. The profound social and economic changes experienced by Punjabi society (and in India in general) under British rule also generated the rise of new elites. As in other British colonies, these new elites learned from the rulers and their agents and imbibed some of their values. At the same time, however, they reacted against and resisted colonial domination and inferiorization, transformed old traditions, and invented new ones. As Oberoi puts it: The Dalhousian revolution in communications, the commercialization of the rural economy, the rise of new market towns and trading networks, the establishment of schools and colleges to train native collaborators in British modes, the new civil codes based on legal codes instead of customary sanctions, the unprecedented irrigation projects to turn barren lands into granaries—all these transformations dramatically altered the nature of Punjabi society. Punjabi school­boys were made in their curricula to memorize the new changes as the blessings of the British Raj.109 These changes did not immediately produce significant urbanized, educated, commercially prominent Sikh elite groups. The majority of Sikhs being agriculturalists, the commercial and governmental service advantages first went to those Hindu groups long resident in the cities. So did the rewards of local government and municipal politics. But the Sikhs in turn generated their own mobile elites, and these were also the promoters and advocates of a homogeneous Tat Khalsa identity and of preferential educational policies on behalf of depressed Sikhs. A multitude of Singh Sabhas in the cities and towns of the Punjab gave evidence of new Sikh elites organizing in associations to promote their interests. The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army, which favored Sikhs, based on stereotypes of Sikh military prowess and loyalty, no doubt directly affected the development of Khalsa doctrines and disciplinary codes. The trickle of Sikh peasants into the Indian Army after the first Page 159 Anglo­Sikh war in 1846 turned into a regular flow following the annexation of the Punjab. Governor­General Lord James Dalhousie encouraged the recruitment of Sikhs, and the Sikhs' loyal fighting side by side with the British during the 1857 Indian Mutiny reaped rich rewards. \"Thus was Punjab turned into the army barracks of the Raj, and Sikhs made the most formidable human resource within the imperial fighting machine.\" 110 Of interest to us is that the British military authorities required a Sikh recruit to undergo the initiation rite, and to exhibit the external symbols of his faith, and employed \"grunthees\" (readers of the Granth and gurudwara functionaries) to conduct Sikh rituals. Thus, ignorant or unmindful of the complex array and diversity of Sikh practices, \"army commanders enforced an extremely narrow, functional and mechanistic definition of the Sikh faith.\" Since the army's sponsorship of a particular image of Sikhism accorded so well with that upheld by the Tat Khalsa, it is no wonder that Sikh soldiers became the staunchest supporters of the latter's project.111 Sikh Protest Politics Against the Raj Where Oberoi leaves off is an apt place to review the submissions of Richard Fox in Lions of the Punjab. Fox attempts to fit together the ethnographic and historical particulars of what he calls the \"Punjab puzzle,\" which consists of two questions. First, \"Why did followers of Sikhism, specifically those called Singhs or 'Lions,' engage in a mass rural protest against British rule that shook early twentieth­century Punjab?\" (The protest in question took place between 1920 and 1925 and was part of a vigorous political activity mounted by the Akali movement.) Second, \"Where did the Sikh identity that provided the cultural meaning for the social movement come from?\" Let us take the second question first. Fox's answer is that \"British rulers, in pursuit of their colonial interests, through means dictated by their cultural beliefs, foreshadowed, even constructed, the Sikh identity which was later espoused by the Singh Sabhas.\" By \"cultural beliefs,\" Fox has in mind nineteenth­century British \"orientalizing beliefs\" predicated on notions of racial divisions of humankind, which in India took the form of treating certain Indian religious communities, castes, or regional populations as so many distinctive and bounded species. The primary agent of this identity­shaping process was the British Indian Army, which nurtured the orthodox, separatist, and martial identity of the turbaned and unshorn Singh among Sikh rural recruits to its regiments and companies.112 This claim has, as we saw earlier, been refuted by Harjot Oberoi, who has convincingly sketched the Tat Khalsa's forging of this specialized identity in the eighteenth century. Others have supported this critique.113 But all are Page 160 agreed that the British Army played an intensifying and sustaining role in that kind of Sikh identity formation adopted and reworked by the reforming urban middle­ and lower­middle­class Sikhs who led the Akali movement. Fox's discussion of the roots and direction of the urban and rural protest movements of the early 1920s sets the stage for understanding the Akali politics that precedes the final shift to the fundamentalist extremism of Bhindranwale's militancy. It is stated that the penetration of capitalist world economy into the Punjab under the aegis of British colonialism generated certain internal contradictions characterized by the differences between the economy of the petty commodity­producing small peasantry, dependent on well irrigation, in the central Punjab, and the more mercantile and prosperous economy of the canal colonies. These two zones came into competition with each other, and the small producers of the central Punjab became increasingly disadvantaged even as they intensified their labor inputs to the point of self­ exploitation in order to compete with the labor­saving benefits that canal irrigation provided the colonists. In other words, unequal exchange resulted, value flowing from the former to the latter. \"When the Punjab's rural economy deteriorated after World War I (a collapse precipitated by the contradictions of colonial exploitation), peasants, imbued with the Raj's image of the militant Singh, joined with urban reformers, who broadcast a similar identity. The upshot was a mass religious protest that was also a political uprising; it lasted for five years and was only put down at great cost to the British.\" 114 Fox's interesting submission is that the Akali movement began as \"religious reformism in Punjab cities and ended as anticolonial revolt in Punjab villages.\"115 He attempts to show that the protest began at urban sites where a spirit of \"reformed\" Sikh consciousness as a struggle for cultural identity, political power, and economic privileges had developed, especially among lower­middle­class Sikhs. From these urban centers, especially in the immediate postwar years, the movement spread to and inducted an aggrieved rural population in the central Punjab, and then the better­placed rural lower middle class of the canal colonies, climaxing as a movement of mass protest that \"equally expressed religious intent, anti­colonialism and agrarian protest.\"116 The Akali movement dynamically moved through three successive confrontations. The identity consciousness of the Singh Sabha movement was in its first phase a response to the Hindu revivalist and reformist militancy of certain Arya Samaj enthusiasts, whose threat of incorporating or converting Sikhs elicited not only an affirmation of separate identity but also a struggle by the Akalis to gain control of Sikh shrines.117 At the same time, as we saw in Oberoi's account, there arose a contest on the part of the Tat Khalsa Sikhs (Fox's \"Lions\") to dominate, marginalize, and inferiorize Page 161 the Sanatan (and Sahajdhari) traditions of non­Khalsa Sikhs. This was an internal war among the Sikhs. Ultimately, a struggle between the Singhs/Khalsa Sikhs and the British Raj broke out. The struggle of these urban reform Sikhs to take control of Sikh shrines managed by conservative mahants and ritual officiants tolerant of Sanatan eclecticism brought the Singhs into conflict with the British colonial authorities, who supported managers in place and suspected the Singhs of hatching an anticolonial subversion. The actual techniques and strategies of induction of the rural lower middle class and peasantry deployed by the Akali leaders were similar to those used by British army recruiters among rural Sikhs, while the protest campaigns often resonated with military overtones. According to Fox's account, while Amritsar, the home of the first Singh Sabha, organized in 1873, was dominated by the rich landed gentry, by the orthodox, who were loyal to the Raj, and by their temple functionaries, the rival Singh Sabha in Lahore, founded six years later, was more egalitarian, espoused the separatist identity advocated by Guru Gobind, and represented the inclinations of the growing urban lower middle class. \"The battle between Lahore and Amritsar, between Sikh and Singh, between temple functionary and lower­middle class served as the agency for turning the contradiction in British domination into an anticolonial confrontation.\" 118 In 1880, the Lahore and Amritsar associations cooperatively formed the Khalsa Diwan to coordinate the various Singh Sabhas, but their differences were more or less smoothed out by the time the Chief Khalsa Diwan of Amritsar was formed in 1902 to succeed it. \"The Chief Khalsa Diwan preached an unequivocal Sikh identity and came increasingly to labor for the religious equality of the low castes.\" It was led by persons drawn from the ranks of teachers, professionals, merchants, and government servants. In the early years of the twentieth century, more rural Jats joined the movement as urban Khalsa advocates successfully invoked the Singh image, which was concordant with Jat traditions of \"militancy, organized protest, and when necessary violence.\"119 Ian Kerr avers that because Fox does not give full value to pre­existing Jat dispositions, such as the use of violence in factional politics, he exaggerates the role of the urban reforming Sikhs in imparting a militant identity to the rural Jats.120 Be that as it may, the important point for us (and this links up with Oberoi's documentation) is that the Tat Khalsa urban reformers increasingly collided with temple authorities and shrine functionaries, who from their point of view tolerated caste inequities and Hindu practices. Although the Chief Khalsa Diwan had been pro­reform in some matters, such as removing Hindu idols from the Golden Temple and passing the Anand Marriage Act in Page 162 1909 (which legalized a non­Brahmanical ceremony for Singhs), it was viewed by the younger and more radical reformers as harboring pro­British attitudes. The Khalsa/Singh radicals severed their connection with the Chief Khalsa Diwan and in December 1919 formed the Central Sikh League, which became the left wing of the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the major support of the Akali Dal in the 1920s. As the Raj itself progressively came to see the reformers as subversive of imperial interests, it abandoned its earlier espousal of the army recruiter's stereotypic image of the militant and loyal Singh. Meanwhile, \"the Central Sikh League called for jathas \\[demonstrations by volunteers\\] against temple functionaries and noncooperation with the government at one and the same time. . . . By 1920 at the latest—with the creation of the SGPC and the Akali Dal—both the colonial government and the Singh reformers had become conscious of what their confrontation had always objectively involved: religion, identity, and power.\" 121 Kerr has drawn attention to the considerable role of the revolution in communications in the Punjab—the expansion in roads, railways, the print media, and telephone and telegraph systems—in promoting social mobilization by the Akali movement.122 No less important were the campaigns \"conducted in the typical format of Akali morchas evolved during the Sikh Gurudwara Reform movement in the early twenties,\" Attar Singh observes. \"Organized essentially as a regular display of collectively nonviolent defiance of state authority, these morchas came to be associated with sending out bands of volunteers known as jathas every day over a considerable period of time to attract public notice and make dramatic impact.\" This required both a safe assembling point for the volunteers, from which they would also proceed, and a safe sanctuary for the organizers who were in charge of making camping arrangements.123 This legacy of demonstrations would be put to effective use in later times, although there would be a shift to violence as in the case of the 1982 Dharam Yudh morcha begun by Bhindranwale and the Shiromani Akali Dal. This historical account has covered the dynamic developments among the Sikhs, their internal sectarian religious disputes, their continuous attempts to define their identity and to erect boundaries vis­à­vis the larger Hindu society, the increasing dominance of the militant Tat Khalsa, and the organized resistance they mounted against the Raj. It meaningfully connects with the issues with which we began this chapter, \"The Politics of the Akali Dal Movement\" and \"Political Contests, 1947– 1984.\" It helps us better understand the emergence of Bhindranwale and the roots of his revivalist, purificatory, separatist movement. Page 163 6 Ethnic Conflict in Pakistan Pakistan's peculiar ethnic and provincial complexity, and its dynamic shifting politics conducted in a tense regional environment in which India, Afghanistan, Iran, China and the former USSR were bordering countries, generated many kinds of internal conflicts, as well as stressful relations with India. Ayesha Jalal has vividly enumerated the country's wounds and scars: Painfully carved out of the Indian subcontinent—ostensibly to provide a homeland for the Indian Muslims—Pakistan has been remarkable more for the tensions between its dominant and subordinate regions than for the purported unities of a common religion. Of the forty­two years since its creation, Pakistan has seen military or quasi­military rule for twenty­five; it has been governed under six different constitutions and has been at war with India on three separate occasions. In 1971 Pakistan lost a majority of its Muslim population with the breakaway of its eastern wing and the establishment of a new country, Bangladesh—the only successfully secessionist movement in a newly independent state. A civil war in which Muslim slaughtered Muslim might seem to have exploded the notion that religion alone was sufficient cement to hold Pakistan together. There have been continuing tensions in its remaining provinces in the west. 1 Like those of India next door, the cities and towns of Pakistan have known many communal riots as intermittent events, involving different antagonists. For example, Karachi \"has seen anti­Qadiani \\[Ahmedi\\] riots in the early fifties, anti­Pathan riots in 1965, anti­Qadiani riots again in 1969–70, Sindhi­Muhajir riots in 1972–73, and a yearly encounter of Shia­Sunni sectarian riots before the Orangi troubles of 1985.\"2 Since then clashes between Pathans and Biharis have occurred in October and December 1986 and February and July 1987, and between Muhajirs and Page 164 Sindhis in May, September, and October 1988, and again in May–June 1990. This ominous listing of outbreaks can be roughly divided into three types. The Shia and Sunni have clashed in Karachi since before independence \"with ritualized regularity during the religious month of Moharrum, on the occasion of Ashura, when both sects take out processions.\" 3 Very little documentation is readily available to say more about this classic example of religious processions on festival days acting as triggering events for clashes between sectarian groups concentrated in different localities of the city, and possibly directed by local leaders and their retinues. With the difference in religious affiliation may go other ingredients, such as competition in trade and crafts, control of urban territory, and the wielding of local power. The processions themselves may performatively image and contest questions of sectarian, caste, and neighborhood precedence and position in a hierarchy of prestige. Parts of Pakistan, the Punjab in particular, are famous for the purges mounted by orthodox and activist religious­cum­political parties, such as the Majlis­i­Ahrar and Jama at­i­Islami, against the Ahmedis, who are considered by them to be traitors and fifth columnists (munafiqeen). The pious assailants, champions of the cause of \"Islamization\" of the country, and watchdogs against Hindu infusions, have mounted periodic collective violence against this religious minority, who have scarcely retaliated in kind.4 The fact that members of this minority are by and large educated and prominently placed in branches of the professions may have incited their conspicuous targeting. They are also branded by some assailants as British collaborators. Postmortems on the riots have studiously ignored the issue of religious tolerance; the authorities have treated them as simply a law­and­order issue. \"A cumulative presence resulted in the Ahmedis being declared non­Muslims during Bhutto's tenure, and more recently other such measures were taken by Zia's regime.\"5 We should recall that during the 1980s, a government­sponsored \"Islamic revival\" led to fierce debates about the form of government, Islamic or secular, that Pakistan should adopt. Especially since the Ahmedi heterodoxy is a convenient and combustible issue that can be exploited by religiopolitical groups wanting to muster strength quickly, one cannot say when and how anti­Ahmedi riots may explode again.6 Aside from the two categories discussed above, the religion of Islam as such has not figured as an issue—in terms of orthodoxy—in the \"ethnic\" conflicts that have taken place in Pakistan in the 1980s. The two major kinds of conflict involving riots and other kinds of violence, by both civil­ Page 165 ians and government security forces, concern two pairs—the Muhajirs (literally \"refugees\") versus the Pathans (especially in Karachi), and the Muhajirs versus the Sindhis (especially in Karachi, Hyderabad, and certain other urban sites in Sind Province). Ethnic identity in these clashes has primarily invoked essentialist links with language, home territory, and tribal or other communal ties in variable mixes; the issues raised as integral to collective ethnic interests have to do with educational opportunities and attainments; employment opportunities at all levels; both local and national political power; control of urban space, real estate, and communication facilities; and migration of people from other provinces into one's own, or from India and Bangladesh into Pakistan. In this chapter I focus on the Muhajir­Sindhi and Muhajir­Pathan clashes and seek to place them in their larger contexts. Muhajirs and Sindhis With 60 percent of the country's population, the Punjab is clearly the \"dominant\" Pakistani province today. Punjabis constitute about 80 percent of the army and dominate the central government. But in the early history of the founding of Pakistan, the Punjab did not occupy the limelight. For Pakistan was founded, not by Punjabis, but largely by North Indian Urdu­speaking Muslims, under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah (a Cutchi­speaking Khoja Ismaili from Bombay), Liaquat Ali Khan (an Urdu speaker from Oudh), and Fazh­ul­Haq (a Bengali Muslim). Only gradually, in the 1950s and afterwards, did Punjabi politicians come into their own. The political scientist Anwar Syed has this to say about the perception by non­Punjabis of Punjabi domination: \"The regime they maintain, mainly through their predominance in the military and the higher bureaucracy, has traditionally been authoritarian. Politicians in the minority provinces, who are not only excluded from power but persecuted, seek relief by diminishing the arena—the central government—from which the Punjabis operate their repressive and allegedly exploitative system of rule. The talk of nationality and autonomy is thus part of the counterelite's defense against the ruling elite's oppression and repression.\" 7 Punjabi dominance in contemporary Pakistan's politics is one of the factors in the discontent of certain provinces and lies behind the stress on the need for provincial autonomy and for keeping the federal government in check. Punjabi dominance is the inevitable backdrop to any study of Pakistan's ethnic conflicts (a prominent instance is the figure of President Mo­ Page 166 hammed Zia ul­Haq). The bulk of my account relates to Sind, and the Punjabi factor is part of the landscape. Refugees in Sind Province The changing fortunes and role of the refugees (muhajirin) who at Partition left north India to settle across the border in Pakistan are integrally linked to the shifting course of ethnic politics and conflict there. The first wave of refugees, many millions in number (they made up 8 percent of Pakistan's population in 1951), and still labeled Muhajirs, were Urdu and Gujarati speakers. Most of them emigrated to the port city of Karachi, and because of their high literacy rate, educational attainments, and political involvement in the creation of Pakistan, they have played a conspicuous political role in the governance of the country and enjoyed economic success. \"In the elite Civil Service of Pakistan, the Muhajir share remained disproportionately large throughout the 1960s,\" Theodore P. Wright, Jr., notes. 8 Karachi, the national capital until 1958 and now the provincial capital of Sind Province, remains Pakistan's most populous and industrially most developed city. But it is not a Sindhi city in population, wealth, power, or culture. Wright observes that although linguistically homogeneous, prepartition Sind, somewhat like united Bengal, was sharply split communally between an urban and modernizing Hindu minority and a largely rural and feudally dominated Muslim peasantry. Thus, after Pakistan's independence, when most of the Hindu Sindhis emigrated to India, they were replaced in the cities and modern occupations by a huge influx of equally advanced Urdu­speaking Muslim refugees (Muhajirin) from northern India and Delhi and by Gujarati­speaking businessmen from Bombay and the west coast of India. Sind as a province, with 23 % of the country's population, soon contained a disproportionate 60 % of its industry, and a per capita income 40 % higher than the Punjab's. Muslim Sindhis, however, were left at a disadvantage in their own province; only ten per cent were literate, compared to seventy per cent of the newcomers.9 The Sindhis were thus in the position of being the depressed indigenous people in a relatively prosperous province. The Muhajirs (joined after 1971 by Bihari refugees from what became Bangladesh) are \"ethnically\" diverse and have no \"homeland\" to which they can territorially relate. Their initial dominance in the cities of Sind, primarily in Karachi, but also in Hyderabad, and in national politics has been diminishing over time, and they have progressively come to fear being marginalized or peripheralized. Their strategy has therefore been to Page 167 try and gain recognition as a ''fifth nationality\" (the others being the Punjabis, Sindhis, Baluchis, and Pathans), and to coalesce as a political movement. Some older Muhajirs may still be loyal to the political party dedicated to Islamization, the Jama at­i­Islami, but many young Muhajirs, especially those who are educated, unemployed, and seeking redress from \"discrimination\" by governments favoring Sindhi and Punjabi interests, have formed the Muhajir Qaumi Mahaz (MQM, or Refugee Nationality Movement), which has become militant while forging ahead in national and provincial Sind politics. The countermovement of Sindhi politics and mobilization has followed a course that has resulted in political parties sponsoring exclusively Sindhi interests, such as the Pakistan National Party and the Sind National Alliance, or Sindhi interests in coalition with other regions feeling marginalized, such as the Sind­Baluch­Pakhtun Front. One strand of Sindhi politics has eventually turned militant and even terrorist, in the form of the Jiye Sind movement, keeping pace with and mirroring the extremist wings of the MQM, the militant arm of the Muhajirs. Sindhi regionalism is fueled by many felt grievances that have accumulated since the founding of Pakistan. \"In some ways Pakistan's Sindhi problem and India's Sikh separatism bear comparison: both peripheral groups are fearful of becoming minorities in their own provinces; both are the most prosperous provinces in their respective countries but with wealth unequally distributed between and within ethnic groups; and, most ominously, both are located on the sensitive borders of hostile states always tempted to 'fish in troubled waters,'\" Wright observes. 10 After Partition, \"the bulk of non­Punjabi migrants who came to West Pakistan from India arrived in Sind and settled in the urban centers of Hyderabad and Karachi,\" Farida Shaheed notes. \"The Muhajirs were culturally distinct from the Sindhis and, though composed of various ethnic groups, gravitated towards the Urdu­speaking culture of central India, so that Urdu became the lingua franca of Karachi.\"11 The dominance of the Sindhi language was in due course tested in all the major cities of Sind. Other government policies made the indigenous Sindhis feel that they were being discriminated against and being swamped by the newly arrived outsiders. The situation in Sind was further complicated by land policies. To compensate for their losses in India, refugees were given land, while the government also continued the British policy of allotting land to armed­forces personnel. Since there were virtually no Sindhis in the armed forces, both policies resulted in the province's land being progressively acquired by non­Sindhis. Finally, Page 168 unbalanced economic policies discriminated against all provinces in favor of Punjab and the city of Karachi. The latter, though situated in Sind, was dissociated from the province and monopolized by non­Sindhis (and initially dominated by Muhajirs). Sind was thus deprived of its greatest asset: Karachi. 12 In time, especially under the government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1971–77), a sizeable Sindhi educated class was able to compete with the Muhajirs, although it sharply resented the usurpation of its land and employment opportunities by outsiders. The Sindhi Predicament The frustrations and beleaguered worldview of the Sindhis are eloquently expressed by Anwar Syed: In all of Pakistan the Sindhi­speaking people, also called the \"old Sindhis,\" harbor a most anguishing sense of deprivation. They . . . have been reduced to a minority in their cities and larger towns. They fear that they may soon become a minority in the province as a whole. The Muhajirs have attempted to impose their own language and culture on the Sindhi­speaking people in the name of Islam and Pakistani patriotism. They and other settlers have taken economic resources and opportunities that would otherwise have gone to the Sindhi­speaking people. The old Sindhis are virtually absent from Pakistan's armed forces and they are poorly represented in the federal bureaucracy. Many high­ranking positions even in the government of their own province have been filled by Muhajirs and Punjabis either because they have established residence and obtained Sindhi domicile certificates or because they have been sent in by the central government. The old Sindhis regard this state of affairs as unmitigated oppression and they want to put a stop to it.13 Additionally, Sindhis see a confirmation of their view of the Punjabi interests backed by Punjabi domination of national politics in their attempt to implement the Kalabagh dam project, which would divert water from the Indus for the benefit of the Punjab and to the detriment of Sind agriculture. The blocking of this project has been one of the major causes of the Pakistan National Party, which convened a Sind National conference at Bharot in October 1987 to discuss \"provincial autonomy, demographic change in Sind, the Kalabagh dam, and the 'machinations of imperialism' in Sind.\"14 The major concerns of Sind provincial politics were articulated in a lengthy resolution of the conference, which Syed summarizes as follows: 1) stop migration from other provinces into Sind; 2) expand employment in these provinces to keep their people at home and to induce those working in Page 169 Sind to return home; 3) exclude non­Sindhis from employment and businesses in Sind; 4) deny non­Sindhis the right to vote and contest elections in Sind; 5) reconstitute electoral districts in a way that old Sindhis will fill at least two­thirds of the seats in the Provincial Assembly and two­thirds of Sind's quota of seats in the National Assembly; 6) define a Sindhi as a person who was born in Sind or has lived in Sind for twenty­five years; 7) require adequate proficiency in Sindhi of all persons working in Sind; 8) limit the central government to only four subjects (defense, foreign affairs, currency, and communications); 9) abandon the Kalabagh dam project; 10) confiscate large landholdings, control multi­ national corporations operating in Pakistan, and launch a struggle against imperialism. 15 Scrutinizing these resolutions, one is inevitably led to ask how they relate to the interests and future of the Muhajir population of Sind, who are settled mostly in the urban centers of that province and form the majority of its urban population. For example, while the criterion of 25 years residence will admit \"the old Muhajirs\" who settled in Sind at the time of partition and their descendants, what about newer migrants? And how will the Muhajirs, whose principal language is Urdu, take to the proposal that they show proficiency in Sindhi? The Jiye Sind Movement Aside from the PNP, a second Sind thrust has been launched by the Jiye Sind Movement. President Mohammed Ayub Khan's move in 1955 to create the \"One Unit\" of West Pakistan, thereby merging Sind with the other provinces, as a counterbalance to East Pakistan, did not go down well with Sindhis. The campaign to reverse this unification—which was later achieved—is a critical part of the story of Sindhi politics. In order to advocate Sindhi interests, G. M. Syed formed the Sind United Front in 1967 and the Jiye Sind Mahaz in June 1972. \"The Mahaz demanded 'maximum' provincial autonomy, . . . allowing the centre only defence and foreign affairs. Demands included adoption of Sindhi as the only official language of Sind, and a twenty­five percent Sindhi quota in the armed forces and the federal civil establishment, and the return to Sindhis of all agricultural land in the province previously granted or allotted to outsiders.\"16 Provoked by the Bhutto regime's repression, G. M. Syed went so far as to advocate an independent state of Sindhu Desh and guerrilla warfare to achieve liberation. The Jiye Sind Students Federation (JSSF) and an organization of Sindhi professionals, the Sind Graduates Association (SGA), both affiliates of the Mahaz, committed themselves to spreading Syed's aim to ordinary as well as educated Sindhis. In the Jiye Sind Movement, we Page 170 thus see two familiar components: those most committed to the objectives of provincial autonomy and protection from outsiders were educated students and middle­ class professionals who adopted the politics of collective entitlements, meaning quota systems in employment, in higher education, and in the army and civil administration. In the 1980s, it seemed as if the Jiye Sind Movement might be becoming more accommodative. Syed was succeeded as leader by Dr. Hamida Khunro in 1980, and she and her associates have muted the advocacy of Sindhu Desh in favor of the idea of a confederation of provinces with a center of limited powers, and have also tried to accommodate the demands of the Muhajir Qaumi Mahaz for national rights for the Muhajirs (see below). Other developments that have to some extent restrained the violent expression of Sindhi parochial interests include the formation of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), the ascendancy to power as prime minister, after Ayub Khan's fall, of its leader, a Sindhi, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and, after his execution, the continuance of his legacy by his daughter, Benazir Bhutto, at the head of a popularly elected government committed in principle to the \"restoration of democracy,\" which succeeded the regime of General Zia ul­Haq. In time, the Sindhi Muslims have generated their own literati, educated professionals, and successful politicians. Ali Bhutto and the PPP, while stressing Islamic socialism instead of Sindhi separation, simultaneously signaled a time of increased recognition of Sindhi interests, as well as increased participation of prominent Sindhis in provincial and national politics and their appointment to administrative posts. But Sindhi frustrations mounted when Zia's Punjabi­backed and ­led military regime displaced Bhutto in 1977 and executed him in 1979 for alleged involvement in murder. Benazir Bhutto brought the PPP back to life and revived favored treatment of Sindhi interests, but her defeat and the trajectory of divisive politics in the late 1980s exacerbated ethnic and urban conflicts, especially between militant Muhajirs and Sindhis. Before she was elected prime minister, Benazir Bhutto spoke sympathetically of the familiar Sindhi grievances and proposed measures to redress them and defuse secessionist sentiment, such as liberating Sindhis in rural areas from repressive feudal rule and the depredations of dacoits; securing a more equitable distribution of provincial resources among cities, small towns, and rural areas; containing migration into Sind from other provinces by carrying out development in all provinces; jettisoning the Kalabagh dam project and providing for equitable water rights among the provinces. At the same time, however, she advised acceptance of all those Page 171 presently living in Sind as full Sindhis, with full rights, and the recognition of both Sindhi and Urdu as languages of the province. Sindhis and Muhajirs clashed during Benazir's first tenure, from 1988 to 1990, especially in the cities of Hyderabad and Karachi. The Rise and Decline of Muhajir Fortunes \"Urdu­speaking Muhajirin have gradually slipped from dominance (1947–51) to partnership with the Punjabi elite (1951–71) to subordination under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1971–77) and General Zia ul­Haq (1977–88) without even a province of their own, to tentative attempts at a return to partnership under Benazir Bhutto (1988 to 1990),\" Wright notes. \"It is this decline which has produced the militant \\[MQM\\] since 1984. . . . The gradual awareness of the peripheralization of the Muhajirs from an increasingly Punjabi­dominated Pakistan was led by the youth, particularly from the lower middle class.\" Young educated Muhajirs saw their job prospects shrinking both during Ali Bhutto's regime, which awarded job quotas to Sindhis, and during Zia's martial­law rule, which favored Punjabis. \"Consequently, in 1979 Altaf Hussain, a Muhajir student at Karachi University, founded the All Pakistan Muhajir Students Organization (A.P.M.S.O.) to compete with the other ethnic student groups, as well as the Jama at­i­Islami youth group, Jamiat Tulaba, on campus.\" 17 In March 1984, Altaf founded the MQM on a wider basis when Zia banned all student organizations. Before we take up the more recent violent collisions between Muhajirs and Sindhis in Sind Province, let us backtrack a little to the so­called Urdu­Sindhi language riots of 1972. In actual fact, these riots were a product of linguistic, political, economic, and demographic developments, which cumulatively brought the beleaguered Sindhis into collision with the Muhajirs. Jinnah, and after him Ayub, had both been in favor of Urdu being the national language, and in their time, the Sindhi language had even been dropped as a medium of instruction. After Partition, the largest influx of refugees and immigrants into Pakistan were Punjabi­speaking, but Punjab had also accepted Urdu as its literary language. In Sind itself, Sindhi was in danger of being superseded by Urdu, especially in urban areas, in terms of numbers speaking and using it as their mother tongue. But Mumtaz Bhutto, the chief minister of Sind, was a champion of Sindhi interests, and in line with the pleas of the Jiye Sind Movement, he succeeded in pushing a bill that made Sindhi the official language of the province through the Provincial Assembly in 1972. Bloody riots followed, Page 172 and it was left to his cousin Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to award equal status to Urdu. Although Muhajirs and Sindhis had fought bitter battles over the language issue in 1972, leading to the acceptance of Urdu and Sindhi as official languages, they also recognize that, as the older residents of Sind Province, it is in their interest to close ranks against newcomers such as the Pathans and Punjabis, who take over businesses and compete for jobs. The MQM has advocated that employment quotas in federal and provincial establishments be reserved for Muhajirs and Sindhis, and that their status and numbers be determined by census taking. Thus the Muhajirs and Sindhis both want to stop further migration and also think that \"the jobs and other economic opportunities would become theirs if Karachi, and preferably all of Sind, could somehow be rid of the Punjabis and Pathans.\" 18 The MQM, with Altaf Hussain as its chief exponent of these objectives, was able to win majorities in December 1987 in municipal elections in Karachi and Hyderabad. Moreover, and this is where hardliners on both Sindhi and Muhajir sides have met, they both want to contain migration from other provinces and deny recent migrants voting rights and access to employment and business opportunities. If implemented, this policy will have the effect \"of disenfranchising and disestablishing hundreds of thousands of Punjabis and Pathans, which they are not likely to accept without a fight.\"19 The MQM advocates voting rights for and affirmative action on behalf of those Muhajirs who have been domiciled in Sind by virtue of living there for twenty years, excluding non­Sindhis and non­domiciled Muhajirs. It also advocates assigned places for Muhajir students in colleges on the basis of their population ratio. The basis of ethnic group conflict in demands for collective entitlements is transparently demonstrated in this politics of affirmative action. The MQM has also urged that Pakistanis who have left or want to leave Bangladesh should be allowed to settle in Pakistan, thus making common cause with the Bihari immigrants settled in the slums of Karachi. To cap it all, the MQM has demanded that the Muhajirs be recognized as a separate, fifth nationality in Pakistan. Although internally differentiated by sect, by territory of origin, by language, and by customs, the Muhajirs thus seek to aggregate themselves into a homogeneous nationality in a political arena that recognizes at least four other such ethnic labels.20 Additional demands are that only squatter settlements established before 1978 be recognized, that heavy trucks be banned from city streets and driving licenses be denied illiterate persons (measures obviously aimed at Page 173 Pathans), and that all Afghans be placed in refugee camps and be denied the right to buy property or establish businesses in Sind. But as we shall see, whatever the contingent and contextual sharing of interests between Muhajirs and \"old Sindhis\" vis­à­vis newer migrants, they themselves are competitors and antagonists on crucial issues of education and employment and political control in Sind. Case Study 1: Muhajir­Sindhi Collisions, 1988–1990 Between the end of September 1988 and the end of May 1990, several violent clashes took place between Muhajirs and Sindhis, principally in the cities of Karachi and Hyderabad, but not without splinter effects in the small towns and rural areas of Sind. These collisions have deepened the divide between the two collectivities (whatever their internal differentiations). Commentators and journalists speak of a \"polarization\" that threatens to bifurcate the province. Violent exchanges in the two cities and the quick spread of the conflagration to neighboring areas have become almost routine. Thus, for example, on September 30, 1988, \"over 250 persons, mainly Muhajirs were killed when about a dozen gunmen, allegedly led by \\[Sindhi militants\\] Dr. Qadir Magsi and Janu Arain, opened indiscriminate fire on unarmed people in Hyderabad.\" Magsi was arrested, which greatly agitated his followers in the Jiye Sind Movement, and on October 1, 1988, about 60 people, mostly Sindhis, were killed in an apparent \"backlash by Muhajir militants in Karachi.\" 21 The New York Times noted: The reported death toll in the two cities was at least 208. Doctors said by telephone from Hyderabad that 162 people, most of them from the Muhajir immigrant community, were slain when unidentified gunmen sprayed bullets at crowds Friday evening. At least 200 people were wounded, and hospitals issued urgent appeals for blood donors. In Karachi, hundreds of Muhajir militants reacted violently, burning stores and cars and attacking police officers, witnesses said. Doctors in Karachi said that at least 30 bodies had been brought to hospitals and more were expected. At least 46 people were known to be dead in the violence in Karachi. Fifty people were injured. The authorities sent in troops to enforce a curfew overnight in Hyderabad, 110 miles to the east, and extended it to about a third of Karachi this morning. It was the worst explosion of violence in southern Pakistan in nearly two years. Ethnic riots have now taken about 500 lives in the region since 1986.22 This exchange of violence exacerbated the antagonistic separation of the two collectivities, as shown in the results of the general elections held in Page 174 November 1988, when Sindhis ranged behind the PPP and Muhajirs showed solid support for the MQM. Negotiations followed, and on December 3, 1988, the PPP and the MQM signed the \"Karachi Declaration,\" a 59­point document, designed to heal the tensions. In May 1989, however, the MQM ministers in the Sind cabinet protested the nonimplementation of the agreement, only to be rebutted by the Sind government of Qaim Ali Shah. After threats of resignation by the MQM ministers, and intervention by federal ministers, a temporary settlement was reached, with the release of large numbers of MQM activists and promises of accord implementation. Then, in early July 1989, some Muhajir student activists at the University of Karachi were shot dead. In response, the MQM broke the accord and staged a strike. Further killing of Muhajirs resulted, with widespread violence throughout Karachi. Prime minister Benazir Bhutto's move to change the chief minister of Sind did not help matters. Protests against the PPP mounted, and Najib Ahmed, a militant leader, was shot. Fresh riots thereupon broke out in Karachi, and the army was called in to patrol the city in tanks. On May 27, 1990, first in Hyderabad, and then in Karachi, a spasm of violence erupted, whose course will be charted on the basis of extensive cover stories in the June 1990 issue of the monthly newsmagazine The Herald, entitled \"Massacre in Sindh\" and \"Hyderabad: A Tale of Two Cities.\" In Hyderabad, on May 27, the police force, comprising the Eagle Squad and other reserves from Sindh's interior, went berserk in the city—reportedly in response to an armed clash in Pucca Qila a day earlier, in which two policemen, along with a dozen civilians, were killed. A demonstration led by Muhajir women and children was brutally crushed by the police leaving scores of people dead. Among the 60 persons killed and more than 250 injured in police firing on two demonstrations were at least a dozen—in some accounts many more—women. The killing of unarmed women demonstrators was one unprecedented event, and one that gave the entire situation a new dimension. 23 According to the Herald, some informants said that the processions of women and children had been staged for a purely local reason: the restoration of water supply in the Fort area, which the authorities had cut off. Women carrying the Qur an on their heads and chanting \"Ya Ali madad!\" (Ali is our help!) and \"Yazidi hukumat murdabad!\" (Death to the Yazidi government!) were the centerpiece of these allegedly peaceful processions of unarmed men, women, and children. (It is interesting to note that the same slogans were shouted against the shah by the Iranian Islamic revolutionaries, and that they have been adopted and translated in Pakistan). Page 175 But the Herald also reported that \"the latest orgy of violence\" was no surprise: apparently many \"informed persons in Hyderabad\" had had a strong feeling before the violence \"that a new round of disturbances would break out on the last day of the matriculation examinations.\" And, in fact, on May 14, some thirteen days before the police fired on the procession on May 27, attempts to stop students from sitting for the last paper at certain examination centers led to clashes that spread to the entire market area and old city of Hyderabad. Three people died on that day, and a curfew was enforced in the troubled areas. (How student examinations fed into the ethnic conflict is clarified when we realize that Muhajirs felt that the Sind government discriminated against Urdu­speaking Muhajir students by allocating special admission quotas for Sindhi students. One may therefore guess that the disruption of the examinations was conducted by Muhajir activists of the MQM.) It is significant that on May 27, the police were deployed and ready to deal with the procession in the Fort area and other demonstrations elsewhere. For example, three jeeps carrying policemen drove at great speed into the Fort procession, making the people give way. And, apparently the women, when challenged to stop, dared the police to open fire, \"because we are carrying the Holy Quran on our heads.\" The police—one policeman is reported to have shouted, \"They are prostitutes\"—did open fire, causing a stampede, the shrieking women and children rushing into the Abdul Wahab Shah Jilani Shrine for shelter and the men running toward Station Road. 24 Ambulances arrived and carried off the dead and the wounded to nearby hospitals, first to Bhitai Hospital—which had only \"one small operation theatre,\" so that the surgeons were obliged to operate in the corridors—and then to the St. Elizabeth and Mohammadi hospitals. All these frenzied events were taking place to the deafening noise of voices over the loudspeakers installed in various mosques, screaming, ''Come out of your homes, Muhajirs are being killed\"; \"Please arrange cots and bedding for the injured\"; \"Rush to the hospitals and donate blood.\" In response, \"volunteers put up shamianas \\[tents\\] in the hospital compound, while women queued up to donate blood.\" Two things are reasonably clear from the reports. First, the most conspicuous aspect of the violence of May 27, which consisted of many incidents in different parts of Hyderabad City, is that it was contingents of the local police force that unleashed the worst killings by firing on crowds. The bloodshed was compounded by the simultaneous and poorly coordinated action of the \"six different agencies\" on duty, which did some infighting of their own. Page 176 Secondly, this overreaction by police and local security agents, which was expected to quell Muhajir demonstrations by force, was an extension of the killings on a smaller scale that had taken place for some months before the May 27 explosion. Moreover, it is evident that the Hyderabad police contingents were virtually all Sindhi in identity and in sympathy with the Sindhi cause; hence, they were antagonistic to the Muhajir demands championed vociferously by the MQM. While Sindhi nationalists openly congratulated the police, the Muhajirs demanded, not only that a state of emergency be declared, but that the national army be called in to protect them. Two days later, on May 29, Muhajir crowds awaiting the arrival of the chief of army staff, Mirza Aslam Beg, at Pucca Qila Chowk, the scene of the shootings, unfurled large banners \"bearing slogans in praise of the army, and posters of the former military ruler,\" Zia. How could these banners and posters have appeared out of nowhere, unless the Muhajir agitators had already prepared them for their campaign against the civilian government of Sind and its police force? The desperate call to the army by the Muhajirs to save them from the police prompted a journalist to ask, \"Why have the Muhajirs of Hyderabad finally bid farewell to democracy?\" 25 The news of the violence in Hyderabad triggered a spate of violence in Karachi on May 28, with this difference: the Muhajirs of Karachi, \"the bastion of Muhajir power,\" went after the vulnerable Sindhi residents there. \"Fierce clashes broke out between the armed militants and contingents of police and the para­military Rangers in the city's Muhajir strongholds. The clashes were followed by a grim series of target killings, in which scores of people were gunned down—most of them Sindhis.\"26 Altogether the violence lasted about ten days in Hyderabad and about six in Karachi. In both cities the clashes took a familiar form once they got under way: armed battles between the police and Muhajir militants, attacks on Sindhi and Muhajir localities by gunmen belonging to the rival ethnic group, and widespread incidents of arson and looting, along with the occasional rape. It is common knowledge that communal riots displace people and create a refugee problem. But another feature pertaining to displacements of people—forced evacuations by burning homes, intimidations, targeted killings—is that the abandonment of localities in populous cities is also the capture of the same territorial space by the winners (usually the larger of the rival groups living in the locality in question). In Hyderabad, for example, where the Muhajirs were in strength, Sindhi refugees were forced out of Sathi Para, near Choti Gilti, where they had lived peacefully for a long time, and from other inner areas of the city, and they found shelter in Qasimibad Township outside the city. They were put in camps and vacant Page 177 houses there by the Qasimabad Welfare Associations. But the Muhajirs in nearby farming areas, such as Muso Bhurgiri (where they claimed to have settled since the time of partition), and from suburban localities, such as Matiari and Tando Mohammed Khan, were forced to abandon their homes and gravitate toward the inner core of Hyderabad, where they were given shelter by pro­Muhajir organizations. Thus there were reverse movements between the core and periphery of the city. In Karachi, an ironic thing happened: the Baluchi, who are thought to be some of the city's oldest inhabitants, left their enclaves and sought refuge with their compatriots in Karachi's Lyari area, or went long distances all the way back to Lasbela in Baluchistan. Similarly, many Sindhi families in Karachi packed up and left for the interior of Sind Province. It is not clear how many of these refugees returned to their old home sites and how many permanently abandoned them to be appropriated by the victors and by slum landlords with henchmen at their disposal. The increasing availability of the modern technology of violence—a special curse of our time—was in evidence in Karachi and Hyderabad. The clashes between Sindhis and Muhajirs showed that there were large quantities of arms in the hands of the \"ordinary\" members of the two communities, let alone the \"professional militants,\" some of whom used rocket launchers. And in these circumstances, householders began to acquire arms to protect their homes and families. \"Perhaps it was for this reason that once the trouble started, it went out of control of the armed militants. The people, once armed, seem to have made their own decisions,'' one analyst observed. 27 This seems to have been especially true of the strife­torn Liaquatabad and Nazimabad localities of Karachi, where, it is reported, with some poetic license, \"almost every second person on the streets was openly displaying a deadly weapon.\" Large sections of the population appeared to have risen against the state administration itself. It is no exaggeration to say, moreover, that the explosions in Hyderabad and Karachi sent splinters in all directions, which in time reached the remotest corners of Sind. Pakistan's Political Arena and its Tensions Compared to those in India and Sri Lanka, Pakistani political analysts and journalists relate the periodic and endemic ethnic violence and riots in their country directly and emphatically to the weaknesses and inadequacies of the civilian political authorities and institutions at both the provincial and national levels. Pakistan's heritage of military takeovers weighs heavily on many commentators. \"The current crisis of the state in Pakistan Page 178 originates in a state structure inherited from the colonial period in which the military bureaucratic oligarchy is overdeveloped relative to the institutions of civil society,\" Akmal Hussain observes. \"This dominance of the military bureaucratic oligarchy has systematically constrained the development of the political process, thereby preventing the emergence of issue oriented parties with institutionalized grass­roots support.\" 28 Owing to the nature of the process by which Pakistan gained independence, the bureaucracy and the army, the pillars of the Raj, were transferred intact and have continued to determine the parameters within which political and economic change can occur. The failure of the political system to subordinate the army and the bureaucracy lay in the inability of the Muslim League in the pre­Partition period and the Pakistan People's Party in the 1970s to tranform themselves from movements into structured organizations able to wield the power of the people and to domesticate the army and bureaucracy. In her analysis of the forces and factors that have shaped the martial Pakistan state, Ayesha Jalal relies, not on \"the common view\" that the weakness of political parties is the main variable explaining military intervention in Pakistan (especially the fateful takeover of state authority by Ayub Khan in 1958), but on mapping the complex dynamics and precarious internal political balance, the difficulties of the regional and international setting, and Western security calculations that enabled the bureaucratic and military institutions to rise to a position of dominance in the process of exercising Pakistan's sovereignty. The provincial parties' lack of effective organizational machinery is part of this story, as is the county's struggle to establish a party­based system of parliamentary democracy. Jalal shows \"the different ways in which the interplay of regional and international factors influenced domestic politics and economy, distorting relations between the centre and the provinces in particular and the dialectic between state construction and political processes in general.\"29 Pakistan has \"not been able effectively to integrate its provinces or distribute resources equitably between the dominant Punjab and the subordinate provinces of Sind, the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan as well as between the diverse linguistic groups within them,\" Jalal observes. \"The institutional dominance of a predominantly Punjabi army and civil bureaucracy within the state structure has exacerbated regional grievances, especially since representative government, which might have provided a better balance between the provinces and linguistic groups within them, has been kept in abeyance for long periods of time.\"30 Representative government has not had a chance to realize itself largely because the mili­ Page 179 tary and bureaucracy have been unprepared for the divisiveness, polemics, and combativeness of political expression. As noted earlier, in terms of \"ethnic\" identity, Pakistan's army is dominated by Punjabis, and the civilian bureaucracy by Punjabis and Muhajirs (with the latter's control declining). The central power is at odds with the demands and interests of the provinces, and the \"weaker\" provinces, the North­West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, and Sind, feel that the state's assets are unequally distributed and that those in power help to sustain this inequality. The increasing provincial nationalism of Sind is fraught with the likelihood of continuing communal conflict. With their demographic strength decreasing in Sind, the Sindhis, who are no more than 50–55 percent of the province's population, want to contain further migration into it, to exclude non­Sindhis from electoral rights, to limit their employment opportunities, and to reserve two­thirds of the seats in the Provincial Assembly and a favorable quota in the National Assembly for themselves. A Sindhi is defined as one who was born in Sind, has resided there for twenty­five years, and uses the Sindhi language. The presence in Sind of Muhajirs, Punjabis, and Pathans makes it very unlikely, however, that these Sindhi demands can be satisfied. The Sindhi­Baluchi­Pakhtun Front, an attempt to confederate the embattled provinces, may have some impact on national policy in achieving more evenhanded distribution of resources and implementation of projects. There is one final complication to be taken into account in Pakistan's struggle to establish a party­based system of democracy. Some political analysts feel that \"only by inducting its citizens into decision making and by evolving democratic institutions can the state hope to reduce or eliminate the authority of sub­state entities.\" 31 This view is much influenced by what such commentators see as the divisive nature of provincial interests, and perhaps even more important, by their seeing provincial politics in particular as intimately tied to and controlled by ruling elites composed of big landlords and tribal chiefs, who on the one hand challenge the \"intrusions\" of central authorities and on the other hand engage in the segmentary politics of \"autonomous\" competitors unwilling to be subordinated, while at the same time holding the majority of lesser folk in the grip of their \"feudal'' machinery. \"With a large number of the state's citizens dependent on the local tribal chief or feudal landlord, this system cannot be challenged through an electoral process unless the state affords some measure of protection to those who oppose the local power structure.\"32 With Page 180 the present dispensation in place, provincial demands, however genuine, in the end benefit mainly the ruling elites. Starting with the divisiveness of provincial interests and local power structures, the political analysts of Pakistan see as the main issue the question of how to forge a national identity of free and equal citizens ruled by a central authority founded in representative democracy. In contrast, some prominent Indian political scientists see the divisiveness and contentiousness of Indian politics today as a reaction to the excessive control exercised and homogenization imposed by the project of nation­ state making and federal control. 33 The Role of Islam in Communal Conflict It is true that at the levels both of ideological theorizing and political practice, Pakistan has progressively faced the task of aligning and \"reconciling its self­professed Islamic identity with the imperatives of a modern state structure.\"34 Islamic ideologues are basically at odds with the conception of Pakistan as a secular nation­state defined by its territory and a common citizenship. It is also true that \"Islamization\" is a clarion call that has support among various sections of the population and the Jama at­i­Islami. It was in the years following the death of Liaquat Ali Khan that the proponents of a strictly Islamic order began to gain some prominence. But the religious groups sponsoring this objective were divided especially on the question of leadership and united action. Allama Mashriqi who had led the paramilitary Khaksar movement in pre­Partition India, and had organized the Indo­Pakistan League, had a narrow following \"among petty shopkeepers, lower ranking government servants as well as the upper ranks of industrial labor.\"35 Another group was the Majlis­i­Ahrar, which notwithstanding its dubious credentials attained some notoriety because it spearheaded the movement and riots against the allegedly heretical Ahmediyya community. The biggest threat to a secularist stance on politics was mounted by the Jama at­i­Islami. Led by Abdul Ala Maududi, its main support came from the Punjab. Although it had poor electoral success in the early 1950s, it was a movement that enjoyed the loyal support of small shopkeepers and the lower echelons of the army and civil service, and was capable of mounting large meetings and demonstrations.36 One became keenly aware in the 1980s, especially during the military rule of Zia's government, of the emotions, rhetoric, and polemics that the cause of Islamization can generate, and what that would entail with regard to the shape and content of government and its laws. And more than in any province, it is in the most populous and dominant province of the Punjab Page 181 that Islamization has gathered its main supporters. Some skeptics have averred that talk of Islam as the cement that holds Pakistan together is loudest in the Punjab because it is a rhetoric that suits its domination of the country. Pakistan has its religious parties and its ulama (Muslim clerics), and some of its prime ministers, such as Liaquat Ali Khan, and ministers, such as Fazlur Rahman, have been committed to instilling Islamic values into Pakistani society, while some later leaders, such as Zia, have gone so far as to advocate the rule of shari ah (Islamic law). At the national and international levels, it seems to have been ideologically necessary, even imperative, for Pakistan to affirm its allegiance to Islam. By and large, however, neither the bulk of the civilian bureaucracy and army (especially their upper echelons), the majority of politicians operating in the national arena, the majority in the upper and middle reaches of urban society, the big landlords of the Punjab and Sind, nor the tribal chiefs of Baluchistan have ever taken it upon themselves to transform their society to fit the injunctions of the Qur an. Whatever the predilections of Islamic \"ideologues\" and \"reformers,\" it would be difficult and impracticable to write a history of independent Pakistan in which Islam provided the main thread of the story of the course of internal and external politics. Given the fact that Punjabis, Sindhis, Muhajirs, Biharis, Baluchis, and Pathans have over time interwoven and fused provincial territorial claims and participations, local cultural practices and social codes, distinctive languages and speech styles, distinctive clothing styles, and variant kinship systems with their parochial versions of Islamic traditions, it does not seem plausible to identify and reify a common set of Islamic practices as the core that gives all Pakistanis a national­religious identity. In public debate, there are those who remind their fellows that the Muslim League in 1940 passed a resolution in Lahore, the so­called Pakistan Resolution, that proposed that each of the independent Muslim states forming Pakistan would be \"autonomous and sovereign,\" and that six years later, in 1946, the league's working committee affirmed this assurance. Indeed, there are some political groups in Pakistan today, notably the Tehrik­i­Istqhalal, who, while conceding that Islam is the country's common religion, say that the Pakistani ''nation\" is compounded of five different \"nationalities,\" each with its own historical, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic traditions and roots, which are older than the concept of Pakistan. One cannot deny the voices of the ulama and mullahs who say that Islam invests Pakistan with its collective identity; it is noteworthy, however, that they are predominantly of Punjabi origin. The problem of unity versus diversity, and the threat of separatism, has Page 182 been an entrenched problem from the moment Pakistan was created. Before 1971, two different notions of Pakistan were held respectively by the Muhajirs who were refugees from India and those who by origin were Bengalis. For the former, \"Pakistan represented a state that was to serve as a reference point for all Muslims in the subcontinent, in which Indo­Islamic culture would be fostered and protected (especially through the establishment of Urdu as the state language). This viewpoint was a logical extension of the public arena rhetoric on behalf of a Muslim community developed in Uttar Pradesh, an area already considered outside the likely borders of Pakistan.\" By contrast, \"the Bengali vision of Pakistan focused on the working of relational alliances that would enable Muslims to escape domination by a Hindu elite.\" At the heart of the dispute between East and West Pakistan was a conflict over language. The Bengalis, of course, spoke a language with a venerable literary tradition; but for Punjabis and Biharis, \"Urdu represented in the words of Jinnah, 'a language that has been nurtured by a hundred million Muslims of this continent. . . and above all, a language which more than any other provincial language, embodies the best that is in Islamic culture and Muslim tradition, and is nearest to the language used in their Islamic countries. When these two positions proved irreconcilable, . . . the problems of the relationship of the state to the minority was solved through geographic separation and creation of the nation state of Bangladesh.'' 37 As we have seen, Pakistan has continued to generate separatist movements whose expression of regional and linguistic differences and identities challenges the counterproposition that reformist Islam and Urdu are what constitute Pakistan as a unity. The Urdu­centered Indo­Islamic culture is the unifying charter that Punjabi Muslims continue to advocate, and this does not recognize or meld with the regional, linguistic, and local religious traditions of the people of the North­West Frontier Province, the Pathans, the Sindhis, Baluchis, and so on. This set of tensions coexists with another, related conundrum: how to reconcile Islamic identity and norms of conduct derived from shari ah with the imperatives and norms associated with a modern secular state. \"A conflict between a resurgent Islamic clergy and an urban, Western­educated elite undermines efforts to forge a consensus on how Pakistan will approach the 21st century,\" Edward Gargan has pointed out. However, this seemingly clear­cut opposition is muddied and made more complicated by the politics of the moment. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government took steps to make Pakistan's economy a liberalized open­market­ oriented one, which entailed the dismantling of state industry and many state­run Page 183 banks, as well as lifting restrictions on foreign investment and holding foreign exchange—measures lauded by many of the capitalist­oriented elite (although rumors of corruption in high places abound). Western­educated Pakistani intellectuals were alarmed, however, by Sharif's \"steady accession to the aggressive demands of Pakistan's religious right for a more rigid Islamic society. Indeed, the first public hangings and floggings under sharia, Islamic law, have been announced in recent weeks,\" Gargan noted in November 1991. 38 Case Study 2: Bihari Muhajirs and Pathans in Karachi's Squatter Settlements The ethnic riots that exploded in Karachi in April 1985 and October and December 1986 involved Muhajirs and Pathans. But the majority of the Muhajirs in question were Urdu­speaking Bihari refugees from the newly proclaimed nation of Bangladesh. They were especially concentrated in the poor settlements on the northwestern fringes of Karachi, in particular the township of Orangi, Karachi's largest squatter settlement (katchi abadi), with an estimated population of about one million. \"Ethnically speaking, the township has representations from every ethnic group in Pakistan, but is dominated by the Biharis and Pathans, each of whom constitutes approximately 25 percent of the population. The remaining 50 percent of the population is a mixture of Punjabis, Sindhis, Baluchis, Bengalis, Muhajirs, and the more recently arrived Afghan refugees.\"39 Karachi had had a large Muhajir presence since Partition. Then, in the early 1970s, Biharis who had supported Pakistan in the Bangladesh secession war started to arrive in Sind. Some of these were later repatriated, but many others were left in limbo in refugee camps, because Sindhis feared they might lose their linguistic majority. Subsequently, the city's demography changed again, especially with the large influx of Pathans from heavily populated parts of the North­West Frontier Province, who migrated in search of work in Karachi's industrial plants and used the city as a transfer point and conduit for reaching job opportunities in the Middle East. The most spectacular and fateful niche seized by the Pathans has been the monopoly control of Karachi's transport and trucking sector. With the onset of the Afghanistan war in 1979, Afghan refugees flooded the slums and squatter settlements of Karachi, bringing in their train the trade in narcotics and in arms. The Afghans and Pathans have interwoven their trading, transport, and smuggling interests. It is estimated that a total of Page 184 three million Afghan refugees found their way to Pakistan, and of these about one hundred thousand drifted to Karachi. The narcotics and arms smuggling activities of the Afghans are interwoven with the interests that monopolize transport, and both in turn have their deals with and pay protection money to segments of the police and administration: Heroin arrived with the Afghan refugees and the lucrative profits of the trade rapidly transformed the traditional poppy­growing areas of Pakistan's north into the golden crescent of heroin. The massive aid provided to the Afghan refugees by the United States in the form of arms and ammunition quickly found its way into the local markets to provide narcotics dealers with armed backup. The two are inextricably linked, and recent years have seen the emergence of a powerful narcotics­arms mafia, accompanied by the growth of a smuggling­transport­police nexus. The fact that the arms and heroin flow into Karachi from the Frontier, combined with the high profile of Pathans in the transport business, creates the impression that the Pathans are in the forefront. 40 And indeed they are. Certain Pathan settlements in Karachi have become the centers of the trade in arms and narcotics, and as may be expected, they are both at the nodes of the transport system and at critical entry and exit points. For example, Sohrab Goth and Quidabad are controlled by the narcotics­arms mafia and slum landlords. As populations living contiguously in densely peopled space, there are no two groups in Karachi more different from each other than the Pathans and the Biharis. Pathans speak Pushto, while the Muhajirs, including the Bihari, speak Urdu. The ethnically diverse Muhajirs are city dwellers of long standing and have lifestyles and communicative codes utterly different from those of the Pathans, with their tribal heritage and rural background. Muhajirs also have a strong sense of their old homelands, where kinsmen have been left behind. These remain their ethnic point of reference. Most Muhajir of Bihari origin have been and are poor, although by virtue of their artisanal and small­shopkeeping skills, many of them have been able to establish themselves on a firmer economic basis, provoking the envy of even poorer and newer refugees. The politics of real estate development and territorial control is a crucial ingredient in the periodic explosions in the squatter settlements, which now harbor close to 40 percent of Karachi's population. Although officially illegal, these settlements have been a source of tidy profits. State officials collude in the illegal occupation of land by developers, who then subdivide and sell plots to the poor. The officials receive commissions and themselves profit by speculating in choice plots. The developers at the next remove are able to lobby for amenities and services, and also for protection from eviction. Page 185 In the era before the Afghanistan war, these developers were Muhajirs and Punjabis, whose power and wealth were legitimated by their joining prominent political parties, such as the PPP. But it would appear that the fortunes and power generated by the Pathan­ and Afghan­run heroin and arms trade affected real estate politics and the control of space and movement in Karachi in the late 1970s and the 1980s. \"New patterns of illegal land development emerged; new systems of informal banking came into being; the transporters mafia expanded to control the city roads and the old squatter settlements came under attack.\" 41 The transporters' competitive and reckless driving terrorizes the streets, and their retaliatory strikes and stoppage of transport can immobilize a populous city with little public transport. The Pathan­Bihari Riots of April 1985 Akmal Hussain identifies \"transport problems\" in Karachi as \"the immediate context\" making the Pathan and Muhajir communities \"vulnerable to being emotionally manipulated into ethnic conflict.\" Most of the private minibuses linking the various districts of Karachi are owned and operated by Pathans. Owners of fleets of minibuses lease them out at high rates to individual drivers, who are among the poorer members of the Pathan community, and they in turn drive at breakneck speed to beat competitors in picking up passengers, thereby causing frequent accidents. The vehicles, locally dubbed \"yellow devils,\" are notorious killers. Most of Karachi's population, which has grown at a staggering rate, lacks basic public services such as water, housing, and transport, which are scarce, poorly distributed, and subject to frequent breakdowns. \"For most citizens, the emotional trigger is early pulled,'' Hussain says. \"Thus, even relatively minor incidents can spark off a riot: A traffic accident, a murder, or a kidnapping.\" Between January 1986 and August 1987 alone, there were 242 incidents of rioting in Karachi. The largest number of deaths (188) occurred as the result of politically motivated bomb explosions, which led to 76 riots; accidents caused by \"the transport problem\" resulted in 78 deaths and triggered 17 riots.42 It was a traffic accident that triggered the 1985 riots in Orangi. Official reports put the death toll at 50, but it was closer to 100 by unofficial estimates. Most of those killed were from Orangi, but the precipitating accident itself occurred elsewhere. The riots took on an ethnic coloring in Orangi only, and that is what has to be explained. In the early hours of April 15, a girl called Bushra Zaidi, attending Sir Syed College, was killed by a bus, which, racing another bus, jumped the red light, hit a parked vehicle, and careened into a group of students stand­ Page 186 ing inside the College. Angered by Zaidi's death, her fellow students from Sir Syed College and the adjacent Sind Government College for Girls took to the streets to protest the incident, and they were supported by the public at large. Regular and riot police arrived on the scene and mismanaged the incident. When a female student climbed onto a parked police jeep to address the demonstrators, the police reacted by starting the jeep and driving into the crowd, toppling her, and injuring many students. They followed this with teargassing and baton­charging the demonstrators, and scores of students had to be treated at the Abbassi Shaheed Hospital. The brutality inflicted by the all­male police on the young girls provoked many spectator males to join the fray. Within minutes the main road called Nazimabed became a battleground in which the police fought a \"male public\"—which included many students who were alleged to belong to a well­organized right­wing student union, the Jamiat­e­Tuleba, and who were accused by the police of staging the protest. The firing by the police into the crowds caused at least ten deaths that day, plus scores of wounded. In the next phase, the disturbance \"spread like wildfire,\" engulfing the entire Nazimabad area and spilling over into other areas of Karachi (see map 3). Buses and other transport vehicles were stopped, pelted with stones and set on fire, streets were barricaded by the police but also by demonstrators who burnt boardings and car tires. Skirmishes took place between members of the public and the police and transporters. Within hours of Bushra Zaidi's death, what had started as a spontaneous reaction to an accident escalated into widespread rioting which continued for several days and was only brought under control by the imposition of strict curfew in large sections of the city, including Karachi's West District, which houses two million inhabitants in the largest squatter settlements of the country (the largest being Orangi and Baldia). 43 We should note that although the riot was \"unplanned,\" it erupted in a context of general public grievances, which included the transport problem. There is evidence that the protest against the transporters and the police (who were bracketed together) was spearheaded by (male) students who were better organized and also able \"to mobilize and sustain protest in other areas over the next few days.\" For example, a cavalcade of forty youngsters on twenty­five motorbikes rode through the streets urging \"the entire Nazimabad commercial area stretching along the main road where the accident occurred\" to close down in protest on the day following the accident (April 16). The shops responded. The next event in the saga on the same day was the response of the now \"victimized\" Pathan transporters, who called \"a lightning strike paralyzing Page 187 Map 3 Part of Greater Karachi. the city,\" to protest the burning of their buses, minibuses, and some trucks, and to demand police protection and state compensation for the losses they had sustained. The transporters (many of whom were Pathan) also \"retaliated against the public by ransacking a dozen houses and setting fire to police cars and motorcycles (the latter being associated with students) in the northern parts of Karachi.\" The army was called in by 4 P.M. on April 16 to patrol the Nazimabad and Liaquatabad areas, and the soldiers also cordoned off many of the roads leading from the city center to the west and north of Karachi. It was at this same time of army intervention (April 16) that the severe eruption in Orangi Township began, when a bus loaded with students on Page 188 their way to attend funeral prayers for Bushra Zaidi, which were to take place in her house in Nazimabad, was forced to make a detour and arrived at the Banaras Chowk roundabout. The Chowk happened to be the only entry point into Orangi, which it also links to Karachi via Nazimabad. A group of Pathan transporters gathered there pelted the bus with stones, and a scuffle ensued between the Pathans and the students. In order to understand the rioting's final displacement and crystallization as a Pathan­Muhajir ethnic conflict, we need to note that approximately 250,000 of the estimated 1.5 million Pathans living in Karachi are concentrated in Orangi. Furthermore, because of their involvement in the transport business, Pathans tend to congregate around bus and truck depots, auto­repair shops, and bus terminals. Banaras Chowk is a bus terminal for several transport routes, and thus a center for all those activities involved with transport and its ancillary needs, ranging from repair shops to eating places. It was an ethnic stronghold of the Pathans. So after the incident with the students, the Pathan belligerents, inflamed and thirsting for more action, proceeded to the Abdullah Girls College, situated a short distance from Banaras Chowk. \"Once there, the rowdy group entered the college premises, smashed the laboratory equipment, disrupted classes and generally intimidated the students.\" Still in a belligerent mood, the group of Pathans returned to Orangi and ended up in Bokhari Colony, where they continued to give vent to their anger.\" (Bokhari Colony is a non­Pathan settlement in close proximity to Banaras Chowk; it contains Urdu­speakers and a varied population of Muhajirs, but it is not a Bihari settlement.) The Pathans \"attacked and set fire to a dozen shops as well as burning down half a dozen shacks in the locality, causing the death of six or seven persons including one woman who was burnt to death.\" Although the Muhajirs of Bokhari Colony did not retaliate, news of the rampage circulated fast, embroidered with unfounded rumors, and intensifying the free­floating tension. On April 17 (the third day), a small contingent of from thirty to forty policemen arrived in Orangi to maintain law and order. They told shopkeepers—both Pathans and Muhajirs—located in sectors 5 and 10 and in Urdu Chowk to close up shop. Members of the crowds roving the streets also took it upon themselves to urge the shopkeepers to comply. But the recalcitrant owner of Quetta Bolan Hotel in Sector 10, who happened to be a Quetta Pathan, refused to do so. This made the crowd more insistent. Surrounded by a hostile crowd, the owner panicked and fired, injuring four students. The hotel was reduced to ashes, starting \"a general bout of riot­ Page 189 ing in which the steel and crockery shops in the vicinity were attacked and looted.\" The crowd then moved to Urdu Chowk and dispersed from there. However, the news, orally transmitted, distorted and reinterpreted in the process, took an ominous shape in the form of talk of an ethnic conspiracy and collision. \"The bus incident at Banaras Chowk thus found itself transformed into a Bihari­Pathan confrontation although there were no Bihari boys amongst the students. Whether the Pathans or Bihari were blamed for initiating the violence depended on who was doing the telling. Moreover incidents which were not in fact causally linked, became so as news spread. So that, for example, the Quetta Bolan Hotel incident was reported to have been a Bihari retaliation against the Pathan attack on the bus.\" These distortions spread, unchecked by a silent state­controlled television and radio and a news blackout by the official press. Groups of people gathering on the streets to exchange information were in danger of being perceived as gangs forming for attack and defense. And newspapers on April 17 reported incorrectly that clashes between Pathans and Biharis had taken place the previous day. In the late morning of April 18, two truckloads of Pathans armed with axes and pistols toured the streets of the largely Pathan Afridi and Rahim Shah colonies. This caused much alarm, and rumors spread that these Pathans \"were harassing non­Pathan residents and that two Bihari girls had been dragged out of their homes and mistreated. Consequently, people from other sectors, including a large number of Biharis, congregated on the scene. It was at this stage that the confrontations, hitherto opposing the Pathans to everyone else, became a Bihari­Pathan affair.\" By now full­fledged clashes were occurring between Pathans and Biharis. \"If the Pathans were armed with pistols and axes, the Biharis retaliated with stones and bombs fashioned out of petrol, bulbs and metal piping. As the bombs exploded, fires broke out everywhere adding to the general state of chaos.\" By 12:30 P.M., rival crowds of Biharis and Pathans, about three to four hundred on each side, were engaged in pitched battle. Moreover, the political leaders of the locality (that is, the councilors of local bodies and newly elected members of the Provincial Assembly, mainly of Bihari affiliation) who were present, \"far from trying to control the fighting and bring about a reconciliation . . . were apparently inciting members of their respective communities to greater militancy.\" A contingent of both regular and riot police was immediately ordered into the area. High officials such as the district commissioner (west) and the sub and deputy martial law administrators converged and toured the Page 190 area, discovering \"wholesale arson in several areas in every sector of the township.\" After cordoning off the main road and using tear gas to disperse the warring factions, the police \"finally managed to dislodge those agitators who, carrying firearms and other weapons, had taken up positions on the hill tops. Despite the presence of a large number of police and army patrol units, skirmishes and rioting continued throughout the day spreading to encompass an area of three square miles.\" Fire brigades were kept busy extinguishing fires in Mominabad and al­Fateh colonies, where the houses of both Pathans and Biharis were burnt. Even fire engines were attacked. Despite the widespread clashes and extensive damage to property, it was not a case of large gangs deliberately forming and seeking out victims in the other community (the large clash in the Pathan area referred to earlier was exceptional). Violence typically broke out \"in areas of mixed populations and places where small groups of either community happened to come into contact such as bus stops and terminals. Furthermore, rioting took place in a very uneven manner so that even in some of the areas of mixed population such as Sector 5, there was apparently more looting than carnage and the unruly elements were brought under control by the local residents.\" There was no large­scale abandoning of homes either. Although the ethnic conflict was not so much a generalized explosion involving the rival communities in toto as it was a number of dispersed, discontinuous, encounters of small bands, the damage done to life and property in three days was quite considerable: by the evening of April 19, forty­one people had died, hundreds had been injured, at least three hundred shops and houses had been set ablaze, and a toweling factory and a silk factory had been destroyed. Since the rescue and hospital facilities were meager, many people died simply from loss of blood. On April 20 and 21, army patrols were intensified, and a complete curfew imposed for thirty­six continuous hours. And many politicians and public figures began to disentangle themselves from their immediate involvements in the riots in order to address the implications of the Orangi incidents. However, rather than acting to cool down their ethnic constituencies, members of the banned political parties blamed the riots on their having been prevented from participating in the elections in March 1985, and charged that the unrest \"had been instigated by those elements who also wanted to impede the return of a civilian government and democracy in the country.\" In the meantime, the government acceded to the transporters' demand for compensation, thus putting an end to the five­day transport strike. The decision was unpopular with the general public, mainly on the grounds Page 191 that giving in to the transporters' demands indirectly condoned their reckless driving, and that since vehicles were required by law to be insured, their owners should not be compensated by the government. From April 22 onwards, things quieted down; the intermittent lifting of the curfew and the resumption of transport enabled people to go to work, especially in the industrial areas. Essential goods flowed into Orangi, and relief camps intensified their work. Orangi remained under partial curfew until the first week of May. Despite the uneasy calm, however, there had been a breakdown of communication between the Pathans and Biharis. The attempts of \"peace committees\" to discuss matters with assemblies composed of members of both communities were a failure; consequently, representatives of the communities were met separately. The discrimination and punitive measures they suffered at the hands of the police and security forces were one of the Bihari community's major complaints. As Senator Javed Jabbar put it in a report to the governor of Sind: many citizens of Orangi, particularly the Biharis, feared that \"due to the ethnic affinity between the composition of law­enforcing agencies and the other community \\[the Pathans\\], their own security is threatened. . . . It appears that the members of one community are being persecuted and victimized by units of law­enforcing agencies acting on the bequest of \\[sic\\] some representatives of the other community.\" This kind of accusation by a victimized ethnic group against the security forces of the state is commonly encountered when the latter belong to an aggressor community, especially if it is the major ethnic group in the region. In the case of the Orangi disturbances, there is good ground for suggesting that the Pathan community and the police force and army had interests and prejudices in common. The army and police are recruited mainly from the Punjab, and in Karachi, it seems, a substantial proportion of the transport business is owned by police officers either directly or through their relatives. The Trajectory of Communal Riots: Further Elaboration of the Processes of Focalization and Transvaluation We have seen how the original issue of the death of a schoolgirl ballooned into a more general protest against the inequities of the public transport system and that, again, into an anti­Pathan backlash. But there are more twists and turns to the story. Mischievous and distorted rumors circulated, unchecked by the government and its media; and armed, angry Pathans Page 192 took to the streets in their locality in Orangi, where concentrations of Biharis, their alleged enemies, also lived. Neighborhood boundaries were breached, clashes proliferated, deteriorated, and narrowed into a stark Pathan­Bihari bloodbath. Thus, incidents that took place in the part of the city called Nazimabad came to roost in the Orangi slums many miles away; and the Biharis who had nothing to do with the original events—neither the schoolgirl who died nor her schoolmates were Bihari— were drawn by processes of \"distorted\" communication, rumors, and prior ethnic sensitivities into violent clashes with the Pathans. The trajectory of the 1985 Karachi riots illustrates focalization and transvaluation, two processes already mentioned toward the end of chapter 3, in connection with the 1915 riots in colonial Ceylon. Through focalization and transvaluation, local incidents and small­scale disputes occasioned by domestic, business, neighborhood, or other particular issues, and involving people in direct contact with one another, cumulatively build up into larger and larger clashes between growing numbers of antagonists who were only indirectly or peripherally involved in the original disputes. This progressive involvement of the ethnic public coincides with their coming under the sway of propagandists who appeal to larger, more emotive, more enduring (and therefore less context­bound) loyalties and cleavages of race, language, religion, or place of origin. By focalization, I mean the process of progressive denudation of local incidents and disputes of their particulars of context and their aggregation. Transvaluation refers to the parallel process of assimilating particulars to a larger, collective, more enduring, and therefore less context­bound, cause or interest. The processes of focalization and transvaluation thereby contribute to a progressive polarization and dichotomization of issues and partisans, such that climactic acts of mob violence quickly become self­fulfilling manifestations, incarnations, and reincarnations of allegedly irresolvable communal splits between Pathans and Biharis, Sikhs and Hindus, Sinhalese and Tamils, or Malays and Chinese. Thus, many phenomena that are linked, amalgamated, and labeled as \"ethnic riots,\" occurring between named communities during a specified period of time, are constituted of complex processes, which shape the escalating course of events. At first, there is a distortion and inflation of the substantive nature of micro­events. Progressively, there occurs a denudation of the specificity of events occurring in their local contexts and their translation and assimilation to more context­free, allegedly enduring master principles of ethnic or communal identity, interests, and entitlements. The outcomes are seen as confirmations of ancient injuries committed by Page 193 the enemy, and of furtive demographic swamping and economic displacement by the intruder, even unto extinction. Thus, civilians and \"ordinary folk,\" originally drawn into altercations and grievances because of breaches of kinship norms, mohalla or neighborhood loyalty, or business trust, and harried by daily worries about employment for adults, educational opportunities for children, and the keeping of business clients, find themselves caught in a snowballing process and end up as particles of a large, homogenized, and energized avalanche. The difference is that as human masses, they respond to mytho­historical clarion calls that recall their past, explain their present, promise a rosier future, and justify and exonerate punitive violence. From Episodic Riots to Continuous Civil War The ethnic riots thus far discussed were bursts of collective violence with a beginning and an end, and lasting two weeks or less. Such eruptions may recur spasmodically over a period of time to form a sort of series. But this discontinuous picture can change when the conflict between two ethnic communities becomes chronic and they move toward a state of continuous strife lasting several years, as for example happened in Northern Ireland and in Lebanon. When these dynamics are operative, several things are likely to happen. First, aside from fighting with or resisting the ethnic enemy, the embroiled groups may also simultaneously find themselves engaged in warfare with the security forces of the state, initially the police and paramilitary units, and subsequently the army. The Muhajirs and Sindhis were perilously near this condition in 1991 (and the conflict has since worsened). Second, although civilians may participate in riots or in attacks, armed resistance groups or guerrillas increasingly become the defenders of the ethnic collectivity. The MQM of the Muhajirs and the Jiye Sind Movement of the Sindhis represent this phase of the ongoing crisis. (Similarly, the Tigers in Sri Lanka, fighting for Eelam, and the militant groups among the Sikhs fighting for Khalistan represent more mature developments, when episodic ethnic conflicts give place to a civil war.) Third, the conflict sets in motion conspicuous and massive relocations of people. Intimidation, arson, and killings cause a frightened exodus of refugees; then the expectation and fear of future violence pushes out more people, helped by staged threats, bullying, stone­throwing, and ethnic slurs painted on walls and shop­fronts. People leave marginal areas or localities where they are a minority and move back to their centers, enclaves, or ghettos. The abandoned space, Page 194 houses, and buildings are taken over by the aggressors, and property developers, slum landlords, and businessmen striving to monopolize trade or evict competitors all have their share in the way collective violence restructures urban space and ecology. The final stages of these processes crystallize and cordon off ethnic groups in their enclaves, with barricades separating them, and with spaces that are empty or filled with rubble or dotted with the ruins of buildings, the \"desolate interface zones\" where sniping is done, where code words are needed to leave and enter, and from which further campaigns \"for colonizing the outer margins of community space\" are launched. 44 Islamization and its Implications for National Unity How far has the policy of Islamization succeeded in giving Pakistan a coherent national identity and unity? Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League used Islam to mobilize support among the Muslims of the subcontinent, and Partition established Pakistan as a Muslim homeland in 1947.45 Jinnah saw Islam as providing a common cultural heritage and identity for the Muslim majority, and it was in this sense that Pakistan was a Muslim state. But for many others, Pakistan was meant to be, and imperatively needed to be, an Islamic state in the sense that its legal system and institutions were based upon Islam. The strong advocacy of renowned interpreters such as Muhammad Iqbal and Maulana Maududi had their supporters among many ulama, and already in the constitutional debates of the late 1940s and the early 1950s, strong religiopolitical parties and pressure groups had formed, which, resisting Jinnah and the Muslim League, clamored for an Islamically committed state.46 Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938), a poet­philosopher and renowned interpreter of Islam in South Asia, differed from Jinnah in regarding Islam as an encompassing religio­social order and holding that Islamic law (shari ah) should be the law of Pakistan. He rejected the secularist program of Turkish nationalists and wrote uncompromisingly: \"The religious ideal of Islam . . . is organically related to the social order which it has created. The rejection of the one eventually involves the rejection of the other. . . . In Islam God and the Universe, spirit and matter, Church and State, are organic to each other. . . . All that is secular is therefore sacred in the roots of its being.\"47 Page 195 Maulana Maududi, the leader of the Jama at­i­Islami, whose ideas inspired the Pakistani model of Islamization, also took a moralistic and regulative view of the goals and obligations of an Islamic state: Unlike a Secular state, its duty is not merely to maintain internal order, to defend the frontiers and to work for the material prosperity of the country. Rather its first and foremost obligation is to establish the system of Salat \\[prayer\\] and Zakat \\[alms tax\\], to propagate and establish those things which have been declared to be ''virtues\" by God and His Messenger, and to eradicate those things which have been declared to be \"vices\" by them. In other words, no state can be called Islamic if it does not fulfill this fundamental objective of an Islamic State. Thus a state which does not take interest in establishing virtue and eradicating vice and in which adultery, drinking, gambling, obscene literature, indecent films, vulgar songs, immoral display of beauty, promiscuous mingling of men and women, co­education, etc., flourish without let or hindrance, cannot be called an Islamic State. An Islamic Constitution must declare the above mentioned objective as the primary duty of the State. 48 Although claimed essentially to charter a Western­inspired parliamentary democracy, Pakistan's first constitution in 1956 reflected an uneasy and unclear compromise between liberal modernists and Islamic enthusiasts. \"Islamic provisions were inserted in response to the demands and concerns of those who pushed for a clearer articulation of Islamic identity. The title of the state was the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the constitution required that the head of state be a Muslim, no law was to run counter to the Qur an and Sunnah of the prophet.\"49 The establishment of the Islamic Ideology Council to advise the government on its laws and policies, and of the Islamic Research Institute, in no way, however, meant a commitment to systematic thoroughgoing implementation of Islamic law, and the question remained as to what such a task implied and whether it were pragmatically feasible. Tensions and contending interpretations between liberalizing modernists and neotraditionalists characterized the regimes of Ayub Khan (1958–69) and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1971–77). These problems were further compounded by continuing disagreements among the ulama themselves, and between the Muslim sects (for example, Sunni versus Shiite, and, within the Sunni, different emphases among schools of thought such as the Deobandi, Wahhabi, and Barelvi). While ulama of Sunni and Shiite persuasions could agree on who could be excluded from the Islamic fold—as we have seen in the case of the Ahmedis—among themselves they lacked unanimity concerning Islamic tenets and their interpretation, and there was no central teaching authority to turn to for the orthodox version of truth. Page 196 When Ayub Khan, who has been characterized as a Western­oriented Muslim \"primarily concerned with establishing a strong centralized government and fostering rapid socio­economic change,\" established the first martial­law regime in 1958, he reconstituted the Islamic Research Institute and the Council on Islamic Ideology and directed them \"to define and interpret Islamic belief and practice in a rational and liberal manner and thus bring out its dynamic character in the context of the intellectual and scientific progress of the modern world.\" 50 But his appointment of modernist lay Islamic scholars and his modernizing changes were resisted by the ulama. A case in point was their opposition to changes in marriage, divorce, and inheritance practices proposed by a majority of the Commission on Marriage and Family Law Reform. \"Although Ayub Khan, with the support of women's organizations like the All Pakistan Women's Association (APWA), was able to enact the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961, the scope of reform was less than that originally envisioned and the law remained a subject of controversy which would reemerge during the regime of General Zia ul­Haq.\" However Ayub firmly resisted pressures from the ulama to introduce state collection of zakat (a two and a half percent wealth tax), abolition of bank interest, flogging for certain Islamically proscribed crimes—issues which later would resurface and find sympathetic reception under Zia ul­Haq. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who succeeded Ayub, allegedly pursued a policy of \"socialist Islam\": \"Although ideologically and temperamentally Bhutto was a secular socialist, political realities within Pakistan and the Arab world led to an increasing appeal to religion in his domestic and foreign policy,\" John Esposito writes.51 It would be more accurate, however, to characterize Bhutto as a feudal aristocrat in origins and style of life who was also politically inclined toward a directed welfare policy, if not socialism, in the interests of the people at large.52 He sought and wanted power—Napoleon was his hero—and his politics followed from this a priori. His father, Shah Nawaz, was a Shiite Muslim, whose wife was a Hindu convert to Islam, but both parents and their son worshipped and asked for favors at the shrine of Lal Shahbaz, Sind's greatest Sufi saint.53 Zulfikar Bhutto was by no means a pious Muslim, and his penchant for a luxurious social life, which included heavy drinking, extramarital flings (which certainly come under the ban of hudud), and hunting on his estates was a far cry from the precepts of the Islamicists. However, and this is the important aspect of his politics, from his youth he rhetorically yearned for a \"great\" and \"sovereign'' Muslim state of Pakistan that would be part of the larger conglomeration of Muslim peoples in India and the Middle East.54 And, as Esposito indicates, the Page 197 situational logic of his time required Bhutto to attend to certain Islamic issues. The 1971 civil war that led to the secession of Bangladesh was blamed in Pakistan on the Ayub regime's failure to forge a national identity rooted in Islam. Moreover, Bhutto's pragmatic turning to Muslim oil countries, especially those located in the Gulf, for aid and as an outlet for Pakistani products, laborers, and military advisors was felicitously linked to the invocation of their common Islamic identity and heritage. \"Improved relations with the oil sheikhdoms were accompanied by the Bhutto government's sponsorship of Islamic conferences, promotion of programs for the study of Arabic, introduction of Islamic regulations and laws restricting alcohol, creation of places for workers to perform their daily prayers of worship.\" 55 When the Jama at­i­Islami and many religious leaders mounted a campaign against his socialist program, \"Bhutto attempted to Islamize his socialism by identifying it with Islam and equating it with notions of Islamic egalitarianism and social justice. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) adopted Islamized socialist slogans like Islamic equality . . . and published materials which offered an Islamic justification for government socialist policies such as land reform and nationalization of banks, insurance companies, and many industries.\"56 But this attempt to Islamize socialism was roundly condemned by religious leaders such as Maulana Maududi of the Jama at­i­Islami, who made the derisive comment that it was because his socialism had failed (and could not \"dance naked\") that Bhutto called it Islamic, in the hope of shoring it up. Bhutto was thus forced to make concessions such as omitting the words \"Islamic socialism\" from the constitution of 1973, and, perhaps more ignominiously, declaring the Ahmedi community to be a non­Muslim minority whose members were ineligible to hold the highest government positions. There was an escalation in the rhetoric concerning the proper and acceptable relation between Islam and politics, and \"religion had so become a primary vehicle for mass politicization by both government and opposition . . . that in the general elections of March 1977 a broad coalition of secular and religious opposition parties, the Pakistan National Alliance (PNA), had placed itself under the umbrella of Islam, promising an Islamic system of government (nizam­i­Mustafa).\"57 Support was drawn from the traditional and modern middle class: urban intellectuals, merchants and businessmen, teachers, doctors, and clerical workers who opposed Bhutto's socialist measures. \"The middle class nature of the PNA was reinforced by the presence and leadership of the religious parties . . . whose primary base was the urban and town based middle class.''58 But Bhutto and his PPP Page 198 managed to hold on and win the elections, although the way they were conducted and the results were contested by his opponents. The dialectical interweaving of Islam and politics had by now taken such a feverish turn that in many ways the stage was set for General Zia ul­Haq's coup d'état in the name of Islam on July 5, 1977. The attempt to Islamize state and society would reach its apogee under Zia. By the same token, that effort would also unleash all the complications and contradictions and animosities engendered by an attempt to employ the religion of Islam—which was by no means, as it turned out, a monolithic or generally agreed­upon system of beliefs, interpretations, and practices—as the encompassing framework for Pakistan's politics and policies. The Pakistani Islamization drive, supported by Zia, who was president of the military regime for twelve years, from 1977 to 1988, sought an antidote in the shari ah to the alleged oppression of Muslim countries by the West, especially the undermining of traditional practices and subversion of Muslim religious obligations by Western­ style law and legal systems. A central Muslim perception is that Islamic law would restore traditional moral values and social order, which explains Muslims' fixation on shari ah and the legal system as the focal point of reform, restoration, and change. As Anne Elizabeth Mayer puts it, contemporary Muslim fundamentalists tend to transform the shari ah—an elaborate jurisprudence with extensive technical legal rules and interpretations elaborated by premodern jurists—\"into an ideology, thereby treating it as a scheme for reorganizing society that, because of its divine origins, can serve as a panacea for political, economic and social ills.\" 59 Thus a return to the shari ah could mean \"a pattern of hostile reactions to modernization measures, and a commitment to buttressing the patriarchal family, expanding religious instruction in public schools, imposing discriminatory measures on religious minorities, and Muslim dissidents, challenging the legality of land reform programs, or preventing women from working and serving in public office.\"60 It is in line with fundamentalist and reform tendencies that from the whole corpus of shari ah rules, certain of them were selectively focused on and reinterpreted to suit contemporary preoccupations and challenges. Thus today's preoccupation with rules in criminal justice and the extension of the range of criminal conduct contrasts with the premodern jurisprudence's greater concern with civil matters. Aside from crimes listed earlier such as theft, apostasy, fornication, and use of alcohol, there have been modern extensions that seek to prohibit abortion, girls' and women's participation in sports, coeducational schooling, dancing and music, \"immod­ Page 199 est\" and \"un­Islamic\" women's dress, women's participation in the professions and services, and \"obscenity\" in books, movies, and television programs. 61 It is one thing for enthusiasts of Islamization policies, especially the members of the fundamentalist Jama at­i­Islami, to advocate the reimposing of the shari ah (and extending its interpretation to cover modern Western­inspired \"immoralities\"), but it is another for them to succeed in a country with a historical legacy of social and political developments under British rule, including secular education—a legacy of Anglo­Islamic and British law, the rise of a military, bureaucratic, and professional elite (including a legal profession) who had imbibed Western juridical, libertarian values, including the right of women to be educated and enter public life, which would resist and impede the fundamentalist \"restoration.\" Aside from this, Pakistan has a large minority of Shiite Muslims, who have a tradition of being liberal, and having little sympathy for the militant fundamentalist groups drawn from the Sunni majority. (In this respect Pakistan's Shiites present a strong contrast to the Iranian Shiite fundamentalists led by Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini and his successors.) Moreover, the Islamic fundamentalists as such did not by themselves have the numbers and persuasiveness to win parliamentary elections. In fact, the story of Pakistan's Islamization program is integrally tied to the alliance between a military dictatorship—under Zia for twelve years—and the fundamentalist movement, both of which, however, had their opponents within the country's military and bureaucratic elites. Zia, although personally a devout Sunni Muslim, found in the Islamization program a moral imperative and rationalization for perpetuating his military rule and postponing elections. After staging his coup, Zia pledged himself to implement an Islamic system of government. \"Zia employed Islam as a source of national identity, legitimacy, cultural interpretation and public morality to a degree which exceeded that of any previous government,\" John Esposito writes. He had Bhutto hanged for his un­Islamic behavior, appointed some members of the Pakistan National Alliance to key government positions, and appropriated the PNA slogan \"Nizam­i­Islam\" (Islamic government). He also appointed some prominent members of Jama at­i­Islami, whose leader Maulana Maududi's writings strongly influenced him, especially his advocacy of Islam as a comprehensive way of life and assertions that the Qur an and Sunnah must be accepted as the only source of law, and that all laws must conform to the tenets of Islam. In 1979, Zia announced reforms, crucial among which was the intention to establish shari ah courts to determine Page 200 whether specific laws were repugnant to Islam. Early in his administration (February 1979), Zia committed his government to enforcement of the shari ah. Zia continued and expanded the scope of Islamic legal reforms introduced by Bhutto (such as the banning of alcohol and gambling, the closing of businesses and government offices for Friday congregational prayer, provision of space for workers to perform daily worship—salat or namaz). He introduced that part of the Islamic penal law known as the hudud (the limits of God), crimes expressly forbidden and appropriate punishment stipulated by Allah. Examples are flogging for consumption of intoxicants, false accusation of adultery, and banditry; amputation for theft; stoning to death for adultery. In actual fact, of these punishments, only flogging was administered, the others being considered controversial for various reasons such as that the hudud which presumed a socially just society was incommensurate with a society divided by poverty and need, or that the debilitating impact of colonialism required a period of education and preparation before ideal norms are imposed. 62 Zia's mandate that the Islamic Ideology Council review Pakistan's laws to determine whether or not they were consonant with Islamic law, and to recommend appropriate legislation where required, went even further toward Islamizing Pakistan's legal system. At the same time, a shari ah court was created to hear cases that challenged the Islamic character of existing laws or draft laws, and a shari ah bench was created in the High Court in each of Pakistan's four provinces. But in the judicial as well as other domains, Zia's Islamization policies were hobbled by contradictions and dissent, which indicate the difficulties of translating a religious charter into actual practice in contexts of cultural plurality, social differentiation, colonial experience, and the coexistence of modernity and tradition. A major contradiction and inconsistency stemmed from Zia's dictatorship, his military rule, and his virtual placing of himself above the law when it suited him. Thus the shari ah court and its benches were barred by him from reviewing laws in three areas: the constitution and martial­law ordinances, Muslim family laws, and fiscal laws. \"Second with the cancellation of elections and extension of martial law, the implementation of the courts' findings in the form of legislation meant in actuality the assent of Zia as CMLA. As Zia's critics posed the quandary: 'If the Sharia, God's law, was to reign supreme, then how could certain areas of law be exempted from review and why were the findings of the Sharia benches regarding God's law subject to review by the head of state?' \"63 In due course, the fact that martial­law ordinances and military courts were exempt from scrutiny undermined the implementation of many Islamization measures. Page 201 Other quasi­Islamic judicial reforms included the creation of qazi (gadi, judge) courts and the Department of Public Morality in the early 1980s. The primary beneficiaries of this move were the ulama, for the principal qualification for qazi status was knowledge of Islamic law (fiqh) and not a degree in modern law. \"Aware that many of the ulama regarded Pakistan's legal system of law to be antithetical to Islam, the Pakistan Bar Council was quick to issue its own report which maintained that Islamic history confirmed that Pakistan's judicial system was in accord with Islam and that with some reforms the prevailing system of judges and lawyers were fully capable of meeting Pakistan's needs of Islamizing the law and providing swift and inexpensive justice.\" 64 It was in economic matters that Islamic precepts collided critically with capitalist free­market principles and entrepreneurial interests. Islamic activists appealed to Islamic precedents for imposing property and wealth taxes and banning usury. Here again irony and ambivalence and lack of authoritative clarity came into play when alleged Islamic values were translated into practice. Although the shari ah court upheld previous land reforms and nationalization measures introduced by the Ayub Khan and Bhutto governments, both Zia and the court \"were responsive to the concerns of landowners, industrialists, and the majority of religious leaders, who had objected to Bhutto's socialism, and strongly supported the right to private property as the Islamic norm.\"65 Contentious and provocative and capable of generating divisive special pleading were, among others, two issues: the imposition of an alms (zakat) tax and the elimination of usury, especially in the form of interest charges by banks (\"the curse of interest\"). The government's compulsory collection of zakat found critics: some held that zakat is a tithe, a private obligation, not a tax; others, that zakat is a personal individual responsibility, which should not be bureaucratized. The most damaging result of imposing zakat was its exacerbation of sectarian tensions between Pakistan's Sunni majority and its Shiite minority (15 percent of the population). Shiites protested that impositions based on the Hanafi (Sunni) school of law did not necessarily accord with Jafari (Shiite) legal principles.66 A case in point was zakat, which for Shiites is not compulsory on capital or trading money. Similar differences of interpretation occurred with respect to Islamic penal laws and the punishments attached to them. \"In July 1980, Shiite leaders convened a conference in Islamabad which drew more than 100,000 Shii. This was followed by a protest demonstration on July 5 of some 25,000 Shii against compulsory zakat.\"67 The government, faced with this dissent, revised the law, enabling Page 202 Muslims to obtain an exemption based on \"faith and figh.\" On the whole, the large minority of Shiite Muslims have shown little sympathy for the militant fundamentalist groups drawn from the Sunni majority. Similarly, a proposal made in a report prepared on behalf of the Council of Islamic Ideology to eliminate interest on all domestic transactions by stages over three years evoked opposition from within the government and its commissions. However, the government did proceed to introduce interest­free bank accounts on a voluntary basis in many branches of its nationalized commercial banks in 1981. Government institutions such as the House Building Finance \\[mortgage\\] Corporation, the National Investment Trust, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were also directed to run on an interest­free basis. By July 1985, bank interest was abolished on all bank accounts. Overall, in terms of practical consequences, Islamization, despite opposition, did result in extensive restructuring of the operations of financial institutions to eliminate interest; and in changes in the tax system after the enactment of the alms tax. 68 The Zia regime had a restricting impact on women's rights, and women's movements and organizations arose and demonstrated vigorously. Fundamentalist forces and many ulama considered that Islamic norms of modesty required the separation of the sexes in public, the implementation of traditional Islamic laws, and the repeal of the modernizing reforms enacted in the Muslim Family Laws Act of 1961. They considered that veiling and seclusion of women should be enforced in education, the media, and business, and railed that modern changes allowing more freedom to women compromised their modesty. The following statement issued in early 1984 by the Central Committee of the Jama at­i­Islami resonates with their vehemence: Open violation of Islamic ethics, rebellion from Islamic teachings has now reached an alarming point in our society. The public media organizations, with the connivance of certain corrupt officers, are bent upon converting our society into a mixed and shameless one. Vulgar songs, semi­nude and immoral advertising, programs of dance and music, encouragement of mixed gatherings on television, particularly unreserved \\[sic\\] dialogue delivered by boys and girls, the color editions of newspapers full of huge colored pictures of women and feminine beauty are only a few examples of this condemnable conspiracy. This dangerous wave of vulgarity has now gripped the country. Performances by foreign troupes attended by certain very important government officials, fancy dress shows, vulgar stage plays in the name of art, mixed gatherings, country­wide virus of VCR, dancing and musical programs, printing of girls' pictures in the newspapers in the name of sports, mixed education, employment of women in certain government departments to make them Page 203 more attractive and the day­by­day rising process of seating men and women under one roof in government and business offices and even in local councils are all \"red\" signs of dangers against the society and Islamic ethics. 69 Such sentiments were voiced in Friday mosque sermons, pamphlets, newspapers, and Parliament. It is interesting that unlike in Iran, the Pakistani fundamentalists were partially thwarted by women's movements and protests from imposing their restrictions and curbs on women's rights and freedoms. The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), one of the organizations to which Zia entrusted the task of formulation of Islamization measures, was of the view that women should be confined to a domestic role, and that it was \"westernized individuals\" in Pakistan who want to bring women out of their homes and make them the center of attraction in society. Fundamentalists, given access to the media, broadcast claims that Westernized women were the source of decadence and immorality, and that sexual segregation was essential for the preservation of virtue. A series of directives in the early 1980s were aimed at limiting women's public exposure and visibility, such as their appearance on television. Women broadcasters were required to cover their heads and wear the dupatta (a thin cloth worn over their dress). Women athletes were permitted to play only before all­female audiences and were banned from participating in international competitions. When finally admitted to the Islamic University, women were educated in separate facilities from men. Women's groups organized opposition to the Zia regime when it threatened to infringe upon their rights. Restrictive measures such as those listed above \"politicized women's organizations such as the All Pakistan Women's Association, which had been the oldest women's rights organization, the National Women Lawyers' Association, and the Women's Action Forum, which had sprung up as professional women in particular were increasingly mobilized\" to counter the threat of Zia's program to women's status and interests.70 Women engaged in public protests in Lahore in February 1983 to denounce a proposed law on evidence that would allow a woman's testimony to be devalued in relation to a man's. The original draft Evidence Bill asserted that the evidence of two women equaled that of one Muslim male, but this was later modified to apply only in specified cases.71\"Although the evidence law was enacted in 1984, the regime was chastened by the feminists' response. Thus certain proposals for new laws, such as one that would have reinstated the Sharia rule that in cases of killings the value of a woman's life was to be calculated as being worth one­half that of a Page 204 man's, were never actually enacted, despite strong support from fundamentalists.\" 72 Zia's authoritarianism, which had banned political parties and had restricted political participation, inevitably engendered a cumulative thrust for the restoration of democracy. In February 1981, the banned political parties came together to form the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD). In due course, even religious leaders who favored Zia's Islamization program found common cause with other political parties in calling for elections. By the spring of 1984, the Jama at­i­ Islami, which had continued to support Zia, called for a joint front to oppose martial law and campaign for the restoration of democracy, and declared a nonconsultative military government to be un­Islamic. In February 1985, national and provincial elections took place on a nonparty basis, with Zia still maintaining that Islamic democracy did not permit political parties. However, by the end of 1985, martial law was terminated, civilian rule was restored, press censorship was lifted, and political parties were allowed to function with some restrictions. But even this transition to democracy was compromised by Zia's amendment of the constitution to assure the ultimate power of the president to appoint and dismiss the prime minister and to exempt from prosecution those associated with his martial­law regime. Despite the inauguration of a civilian government under Prime Minister Muhammad Khan Junejo, there was a mounting political protest on the part of both the MRD and the Jama at­i­Islami demanding free elections based on a political party system and the resignation of Zia as army chief of staff if he were to be a true civilian president. And then in 1986, Benazir Bhutto appeared on the scene to lead the protest and to revive and energize her father's party, the PPP. After more than a decade of military rule and rule under martial law from 1977 to 1985, which while pushing for Islamization also permitted some dissent and had in some ways moved pragmatically in piecemeal fashion, Zia in June 1988 took the fateful step of issuing a presidential decree that asserted that all government policies would henceforth be guided by Islamic law, and that all laws contravening Islamic law would be nullified. \"This Islamic Law Enforcement Ordinance was apparently designed to implement Islamic law across the board under clerical supervision and to make all laws, including the constitution, subordinate to the Sharia, as had been provided in article 4 of the Iranian constitution. To avoid problems with foreign aid donors and institutional creditors, one exception was made for international economic and investment agreements.\"73 The Islamiza­ Page 205 tion decree, which may have been prompted by Zia's fears of the elections scheduled for the autumn, and his strategy of using Islamic criteria to disqualify Benazir Bhutto, on the grounds that a woman's serving in high political office contravened the shari ah, was vigorously denounced from all parts of the political spectrum. \"Zia's death on 17 August 1988 before the decree had been formally ratified left it a dead letter.\" 74 Zia had saddled Pakistan with a constitutional arrangement that would plague the country's politics in the years after his death (1988–93, the terminal year for this account). When in 1983, the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy challenged the military regime, Zia agreed to restore democracy in the form of a Parliament elected on a nonparty basis, but \"as a quid pro quo, he secured the Parliament's approval for the Eighth Amendment to the 1973 Constitution, which tilted the balance of power in the President's favour unlike the original version which granted Powers to the Prime Minister.\"75 The president was to be elected for a term of five years by an electoral college consisting of two Houses of Parliament and the four provincial assemblies; he was empowered to appoint judges to the Supreme Court and the chiefs of armed services; he could appoint as prime minister a member of the National Assembly if, in his opinion, the person was likely to command the confidence of other members; and finally, the president could dissolve both the national assemblies if, in his opinion, a situation had arisen in which the government could not function in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. \"To put it differently, the Prime Minister holds office at the pleasure of the President,\" Samina Yasmeen observed.76 If, from 1985 to 1988, the Eighth Amendment created an \"unbalanced diarchy\" in Pakistan (Zia was president as well as commander of the armed forces and had to deal with the elected national and provincial assemblies) after his death, the diarchy gave way to a troika, with a tug of war possible between the president, the army chief (and the army), and the prime minister. Benazir Bhutto, who won the 1988 November elections and was asked to form a government, was the first prime minister to be trapped in this triangulation. Benazir and the PPP, which she led, despite invoking the memory of her father and benefiting from disillusionment with Zia's policies, managed to win only 92 of the 207 National Assembly seats. The acting president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and the military delayed handing over power until the PPP succeeded in establishing an alliance with the Muhajir Qaumi movement, giving it a majority in the Assembly, and until Benazir made certain compromises with the army. Page 206 The constraints under which Benazir operated were relevant to the subjects of ethnonational conflicts and the fate of Islamization. Given her uncertain hold on the country, and wary of alienating the ulama, she did not move to counter or diminish Zia's Islamic legacy, or to repeal the Islamic laws previously introduced. Deciding to present a public image consonant with Islamic practices, she went on a much­publicized pilgrimage to Mecca, contracted an arranged marriage with a businessman, and began to raise a family. Even more problematic was the political problems of governance that assailed her against the backdrop of a hostile establishment that was prepared to move against her as opportunity arose. From the start, the federal government failed to establish a workable relationship with the provinces. Relations with the Baluchistan provincial government were tense throughout Bhutto's regime; growing political confrontation with Nawaz Sharif brought relations with Punjab to a low point; and the major cities in Bhutto's home province of Sindh suffered from the worst violence since independence. In addition, frequent allegations of corruption surrounded both the PPP and the Bhutto family. But most important, Benazir Bhutto frequently challenged the military, either directly or indirectly. 77 In other words, she tried to interfere in army appointments. With the reactivation of the Kashmir issue in 1990, and the army's alleged disapproval of her handling it, by August 1990, the rift between them had so widened that the army resolved to remove Benazir. The powers given the president by the Eighth Amendment provided the means. The military persuaded the president to dismiss Benazir's government on charges of maladministration and failure to work effectively with the provinces, nepotism, and corruption, and also to dissolve the assemblies.78 General elections were thereupon held in October 1990, bringing Nawaz Sharif to power as leader of the Islami Jamhouri Itehad (IJI, or Islamic Democratic Alliance), an eight­party coalition. It seemed as if Sharif had better prospects of success than Benazir: From the outset, the Nawaz Sharif government operated under relatively different circumstances. In the 1990 elections, the IJI had gained a clear majority by winning 105 seats in the National Assembly. It also fared better than the PPP in elections for the provincial assemblies and was able to form governments in three of Pakistan's four provinces. Therefore, the everpresent tension between the federal and provincial administrations, which was a constant feature of the Bhutto regime, was not so apparent during the Sharif era, despite differences on various issues. In fact, the relative ease with which the Sharif government operated with the four provinces often enabled it to Page 207 79 settle long­standing disputes. In March 1990, for instance, the IJI government secured a long overdue accord among the provinces over apportionment of the Indus waters. Sharif's policies moved in two directions. He brought in his own bill, the Enforcement of Shari ah Act, 1991, to make shari ah law supreme in Pakistan, probably to ward off a more radical version from the religious parties; he also tried to attract Western investment by projecting pro­business and free­market orientations and downplaying Islamization. His drive for privatization and encouragement of foreign and local investment seemed to draw the support of small and large business interests, which saw the country's increased growth rate as proof of Sharif's business acumen. But in due course Sharif, too, was entangled in the shifting politics of volatile interest groups, and, although he had initially come in with the support of the military, soon differences surfaced over Gulf War policy and the quicksand of army appointments. There were reports in 1992 that Sharif's efforts to steer Pakistan's economy toward ''free markets and privatization\" were being contested by fundamentalist groups. In September 1992, journalists reported that Islamabad was rife with rumors of an impending crisis within the famed troika—the army, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and Prime Minister Sharif. The army had conducted an unprecedented crackdown (Operation Clean Up) in Sind against the MQM, with which the president was closely associated, and which was accused of being 'neo­fascist' and letting its \"armed thugs\" plague the city of Karachi. (The composition and political activities of the MQM, which collided with the interests of the Sindhis in Sind Province, and which were most aggrandizing in the cities of Karachi and Hyderabad, are described in the first part of this chapter.) The MQM was in 1992 the major partner of the ruling coalition in Sind, and a key partner in the same coalition (IJI) at the center, whose dominant component was the Muslim League, led by Sharif. Both Ishaq Khan and Sharif were affected by the army's operation in Sind. Sharif's leadership of the Muslim League itself was shaken up when many of its parliamentary members, under the leadership of Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi (a former prime minister), formed a new group called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). At this stage, Benazir Bhutto was said to be courting the army, despite her previous distaste for it, because this alliance might help to dissolve the elected government and make possible her return to power. A growing rift between the army and the prime minister was rumored as having been caused by the army's Sind cleanup and by an alleged working agreement between Benazir and the army chief.80 Page 208 But what finally brought down both Prime Minister Sharif and President Ishaq Khan was the power struggle between them that began over the selection of the new chief of army staff (COAS) after the sudden death of General Asif Nawaz on January 8. The tug of war between them was a saga in itself, concluding in a double tragedy. Both antagonists were interested to have their candidate in this important position, which had a critical role to play in national politics. The president in particular wanted a dependable ally who would help maintain the powers invested in him by the Eighth Amendment and who would also aid his reelection, due in ten months. The president won this round by appointing General Abdul Waheed Kakar. Nawaz Sharif soon countered by announcing on February 28 that he proposed to repeal the Eighth Amendment, so that power would return to the duly elected prime minister and Parliament. It is thought that this was an unrealistic move, seeing that Sharif did not have a two­thirds majority in the National Assembly to repeal the amendment. The presidential camp managed to engineer a split in the Pakistan Muslim League and was also negotiating with Benazir for PPP support in the coming presidential election, in exchange of the promise of fresh midterm elections to the National Assembly. Sensing his imminent dismissal, Sharif made a defiant televised speech on April 17 in which he blamed the president as the \"root cause\" of the crisis, and flung down the gauntlet, declaring, \"I will not resign and I will not take dictation.\" 81 Calling the speech an act of subversion, and making the usual charges of corruption, and so forth,82 President Ishaq Khan thereupon dismissed Prime Minister Sharif, dissolved the National Assembly, and announced fresh elections. Then took place a dramatic reversal, which some commentators praised as the first demonstration in a long time of the independence of the Supreme Court. Sharif's petition against the dissolution of the National Assembly as unconstitutional was upheld by the Court. Undaunted, President Ishaq dissolved the provincial Punjab assembly, thus foiling Sharif's attempt to regain his base in his home province, and followed up by dissolving the NWFP assembly and getting a no­confidence motion directed against the chief minister of Sind. \"By manipulating provincial politics, the president isolated the central government, making the prime minister realize the helplessness of the center vis­a­vis the provinces,\" Tamir Amin observes.83 When several mediatory efforts failed, the army chief, General Kakar, \"brokered\" a deal by which on July 18, 1993, both President Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif stepped down. A new caretaker adminis­ Page 209 tration was formed, and it was announced that there would be a new midterm general election in October 1993. In the midterm general election, held on October 6 for the National Assembly and October 9 for the provincial assemblies, and said to be remarkably free and fair, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) led by Benazir Bhutto and the Pakistan Muslim League (led by Nawaz Sharif) emerged as the two leading parties, capturing 86 and 72 seats, respectively, in the National Assembly of 207 seats. \"In the popular vote, the PML (Nawaz group) had an edge by securing 39.7 percent of the vote over the PPP, which got 38.1 percent.\" 84 The National Assembly results showed that \"the four Islamic Parties and other religious parties suffered a humiliating defeat, capturing even less seats (9) than the minorities in the National Assembly,\" Amin notes. One cannot, of course, project long­term trends on the basis of these results but one possibility is that the exit of Zia and the return to democratic party politics may have signaled the weakening of the fundamentalist Islamic thrust for total reinstitution of the shari ah, and the bifurcation of support for two parties—one with majority support in Sind (the PPP) and the other in the Punjab (the Muslim League)—which, however, resembled each other in not carrying Islamization any further than where Zia left it, with the possibility that the extreme legislation already on the books would be left to gather dust. The National Assembly elections also showed another important result. \"Regional parties like the Awami National Party (ANP) in the NWFP \\[North­West Frontier Province\\], the Confederal Party in Sindh, and ethno­nationalist elements in Baluchistan also suffered stunning defeats in the national body; at the same time the PML (Nawaz group) and the PPP made significant inroads into the provinces.\"85 This might signal an important trend toward the muting of radical secessionist regional ethnonationalist movements, although not, of course, the weakening of regional pressures for special policies on their behalf. The MQM, which had been the strongest party in previous urban elections in Sind, boycotted the National Assembly elections, and the major beneficiaries of the boycott were the PPP and the PML (Nawaz). The MQM did participate in the Provincial Assembly elections in Sind, winning 27 seats, with the PPP gaining a majority of 56 seats, and the PML(N) getting 8 seats. Thus the MQM showed that it was a presence in that province. In the Punjab, the PML(N) with 106 seats was the single largest party, while the PPP won 94 and the splinter faction PML (Jatoi), its ally, won 18 seats. Page 210 The results of the elections in the North­West Frontier Province evinced a complex situation: the regional Awami National Party won virtually the same number of seats as the PPP (21 versus 22), while the PML(N) won 15, and others won 8. Here again, although the PPP and PML asserted their national importance, the locally rooted party, sponsoring its special interests, maintained a bargaining position. In Baluchistan, the PML(N) with 6 seats and the PPP with 3 got the better of an assorted group of smaller parties and independents. Amin writes: The 1993 elections saw the emergence of two genuinely national political parties led by two charismatic leaders with firm roots in the provinces. However, it was premature to predict whether a two­party democratic system would evolve. Although both the ruling party and the opposition were displaying mature behaviour toward each other, chances for stability remained precarious because of the absence of a democratic culture, fragile balance of civil­military relations, lack of cohesive political parties, and the interests of external powers in manipulating Pakistan's internal politics for their own objectives. 86 The penetration of national parties into the provinces does not guarantee that the collisions between Pathans and Baluchis in Baluchistan, the tensions between Muhajirs and Sindhis in provincial politics, or the conflicts between Pathans (and Afghans) and Biharis (and Muhajirs) in Karachi over the issues of control of space, real estate, occupations, economic niches, and \"criminalized\" factions dealing in drugs and arms will cease.87 The issues of the alleged domination of Punjabis in the army and bureaucracy and of Urdu as the sole national language will continue to simmer. Punjab is also the central base for fundamentalist pro­Islamization activist groups, who are likely to exert most pressure whenever the country is perceived to be fragmenting or \"weak\" in relation to India. Meanwhile, the issue of Kashmir will continue to unite army and civilians against India whenever an explosive issue erupts, as well as heightening the army's propensity to seek the power to wage that war, in which it has invested so much honor and valor, in the way it wants. It has to be conceded that the Islamization project pursued by Zia's regime with the support of the fundamentalists did not achieve a national unity and integration that superseded and transcended Pakistan's regional and ethnonationalist divisions. The circumstances that led to major violent conflicts in the 1980s between ethnic communities and regional ethnonationalist movements are still alive today, but there is also evidence in the years since Zia of an increasing commitment to democratic party politics, and there are signs of the national parties being more successful at working in alliance with regional ones. Page 211 PART TWO RETHINKING THE NATURE OF COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE Page 213 7 Some General Features of Ethnic Riots and Riot Crowds The local histories of particular instances of ethnic riots no doubt differ as regards the group issues that are in contention and the circumstances in which they occur. The case studies presented in Part I, especially the Sinhala­Muslim riots of 1915, the Sinhala­Tamil riots in Colombo in 1983, the Sikh­Hindu eruptions in Delhi in 1984, the Pathan­Bihari clashes in Karachi in 1986, and the Sindhi­Muhajir encounters of 1988–90, to mention some major occurrences in South Asia, were by no means similar in regard to the concrete issues that fueled and triggered them. I shall, however, group these occurrences together in this discussion, along with many others smaller in scale, such as the Hindu­Muslim clashes in Moradabad in the 1980s, the Sinhala­Tamil riots of 1958 in Colombo, the Bombay riots of 1984, and the flare­ups between 1989 and 1992 caused by the so­called Babri Masjid­ Ramjanmabhumi controversy, which has intensified the militancy of both Hindus and Muslims, and also seriously affected the course and outcome of national and state elections in India. By indicating certain general features that all these incidents share, I hope to open a window onto the phenomenon of collective violence itself. The points being made here are elaborated in chapter 9, in which the mobilizational campaigns mounted by Hindu nationalists leading to the demolition of the Babri mosque in December 1992 and resulting in riots in Bombay and elsewhere are further discussed. Typically, although not exclusively, the riots I have identified involved urban populations. 1 Among these populations, both those who actually engaged in physical acts of aggression and those who mobilized and directed the violence were primarily drawn from certain identifiable segments or categories of the population in question. Page 214 The riots were not simply disconnected occurrences, but formed part of a larger incidence of violence, occurring in a wide range of social contexts and political circumstances, which can be ordered on a scale of increasing violence, premeditation, and participation. This larger universe ranged from abuse in family life to petty crime and robbery, to the use of henchmen and thugs to settle business disputes, and to organized thuggery during political elections. And when I refer to widespread violence in the society at large, I include terrorism and violence practiced by the state, principally by the police and security forces as routine practice in relation to the public. It is common knowledge that the police practice physical violence on those arrested, especially if they are of the lower orders, and use coercion to extract information and confessions. And in country after country, police, army, other security forces, paramilitary groups recruited by the state, and even some public officials participated in riots, either as onlookers slow to take preventive action or as vigorous participants favoring the cause of one side. Those entrusted with maintaining and enforcing law and order are rarely neutral in societies where ethnic conflict is rife. In many cities and towns, intermittent ethnic riots form a series, with antecedent riots influencing the unfolding of subsequent ones. Thus the 1983 riots in Sri Lanka, the most virulent so far, were preceded, to mention only the most destructive ones, by the riots of 1958, 1977, 1981. The city of Colombo was involved in all of them. In the city of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, India, where the Muslims comprise about 45 percent of the population, tensions between them and the Hindus have led to communal rioting on eight occasions since independence, as in May 1987, when both civilian Hindus and the \"provincial armed constabulary\" committed atrocities. 2 Many other Indian and Pakistani cities have had similar experiences, implicating the same or different antagonists. A variant on the same issue that is not infrequent in large metropolitan cities containing a mosaic of differentiated communities is illustrated by the spate of clashes that have scarred Karachi, a city teeming with immigrants, where until 1985, annual Shia­Sunni sectarian clashes routinely took place at Muharram (the time of fasting and public mourning among Shiites commemorating the deaths of Hassan and Hussain in the seventh century). Karachi also saw anti­Ahmedi riots in the early 1950s and again in 1969–70. It has seen vicious Pathan­Bihari clashes in 1985, in 1986, at least twice in 1987 (in February and July), and in 1988 (May and October). Chronic Sindhi­Muhajir animosities exploded in Karachi in 1972–73 and repeatedly in the years 1988–90, and later. Page 215 The crowds in ethnic riots in South Asia bear little resemblance to the crowds of mass movements focused on and orchestrated by charismatic leaders of the type associated with Gandhi's independence movement, Hitler's Nazi expansionism, and Khomeini's Islamic fundamentalism. Hence the plentiful literature about mass movements focused on charismatic leadership is not very relevant to my subject matter. The ethnic riots of their time were not induced by the leadership and intentional policies of the Gandhis and Nehrus of India, the Bhuttos of Pakistan, the Senanayakes and Bandaranaikes of Sri Lanka; but lesser politicians and local organizers have frequently been implicated as catalysts, ideologues, and mobilizers. If the ethnic riots and incidents perpetrated by civilian crowds and factions are repetitive, they are also mercifully short­lived, not only because after an initial period of chaos and paralysis, the police and army can assert their dominance, but also because as human outbursts these riots have a short life cycle of orgasmic violence and spent energies. Moreover, these civilian destroyers seemingly return to the humdrum of everyday life and neighborly existence after their spasmodic bloodlettings. These features have also to be construed. In order to comprehend these phenomena, it seems to me that ideally we should first travel on the highways and byways of ongoing social life and view the solidarities as well as the tensions of everyday existence in family and neighborhood, the cycles of festivals and ceremonies in public places, the routines and stratagems and factional battles deployed in mass politics, the risks and hopes of mass migration, the trials of urban coexistence, and so on, before we resort to what is usually labeled \"crowd psychology\" or \"political psychology,\" which has its own distinctive contours and its own revelations. South Asian rioters, like many riot crowds elsewhere, are \"purposive\" in their destruction of property. That is to say, property destruction and looting are not fickle, momentarily dictated \"irrational\" actions but are integral and repetitive feature of ethnic riots, linked to \"leveling\" objectives and tendencies. The riot crowds of ethnic conflict may also combine homicide and brutalities with property destruction and arson. The riots I have in mind typically involve urban populations, and they have occurred primarily in cities, towns, and in dense settlements (such as peasant colonization schemes) with bazaars and marketplaces. It is tempting and comforting, especially for middle­class apologists and Page 216 bureaucrats, to describe the riots that have periodically occurred in Delhi, Calcutta, Karachi, Colombo, Jakarta, and lesser urban places as the destructive and violent conduct solely or mainly of the lumpenproletariat, the unemployed, criminal elements, and slum or shantytown dwellers. But such scapegoating simply will not do, both because it is factually partial and because it blinds us to the important realization that ethnic riots emerge out of a larger context of social and political tensions and conflicts, and that the segments of the population involved in this larger context are more numerous and varied in status than those who are actually seen as the members of the marauding mobs. The faces in the crowd reflect a part of the socioeconomic profile of cities like Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Karachi, Dhaka, Colombo, Kuala Lumpur, and Jakarta, a profile that combines modern architectural complexes, high­rise hotels, factories with shantytowns, squatter settlements, tenements, and urban villages. Many urban sites and spaces in these cities permit the dense contiguity of professionals, engineers, clerical workers, small shopkeepers, artisans, subcontractors, transport workers, factory workers, porters, unskilled laborers, the unemployed, and the underemployed. These cities are also the conspicuous locations of concentrations of schools and colleges, serving the needs not only of the urban masses but also of children from rural areas, who lodge with urban relatives in order to secure secondary and higher education. Schools and colleges, like factories, are places where large numbers habitually congregate, exchange news, provide mutual stimulation, and organize for concerted action in politics and public events. My case studies show that the faces in the ethnic crowds cannot simply be dismissed as vagrants, criminal elements, and the unemployed dregs, but include numbers of students, as well as most categories of the working class engaged in factory work, transport services, and artisan trades, and many gainfully employed in the running and servicing of bazaars and commercial zones. (When riots occur in peasant resettlement and land­ development zones, as they did in Sri Lanka in 1958, labor gangs, peasant colonists, and small­town bazaar shopkeepers and their retinues become involved.) We must not, however, leave out of account national and municipal politicians, as well as their local bosses and agents, with their clients, retainers, and goondas capable of being mobilized as riot captains and thugs or who play an integral role in the organizing, triggering, and directing of the \"purposive\" violence of the mobs. Time and again, a large portion of the police force and paramilitary agents have been inactive or have acted in collusion with the rioters, a matter not so amazing if they are recruited from the local majority and have the same social prejudices and political Page 217 interests as their kinsmen and ethnic friends, among whom they live. Finally, on the fringes of the crowds, we find the unemployed and criminal elements as well. In sum, we must not gloss over the fact that ethnic riots implicate a complex variety and several segments of the population, and for this reason, they cannot be dismissed or underplayed as marginal phenomena distanced from the main body of civilians. I here advert to a point of comparative relevance. E. J. Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, George Rudé, Natalie Zemon Davis, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, and other historians who have dealt with the crowd movements in Western Europe from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries agree that the participants in the popular protests and riots they have studied were mainly drawn, not from gin­swilling criminal elements, petty­thieving casual labor, or vagrants—they participated at the margins, parasitically—but from the more sober \"lower orders\" of the towns and countryside. The rioters were people of settled occupations and settled residence, if prone to temporary unemployment: domestic servants, small shopkeepers, journeymen, artisans, and craftsmen—carpenters, locksmiths, shoemakers, tailors, stonemasons, weavers, and woolcombers. Sometimes merchants and those in the professions were implicated. In other words, crowds in preindustrial Western Europe were fairly representative of the employment followed by the \"lower\" and \"lower­middle\" orders in rioting areas. And the main centers of popular outbreaks, strikes, and revolutionary agitation were central markets, the main centers of petty trades and crafts and shops, and stable residential areas. In short, the mobile vulgus, that hydra­headed monster fantasized about by the propertied classes and ruling authorities, had a more orderly shape than is commonly thought, and redirects our attention to society and the state at large. 3 The cross­sectional composition of many South Asian and other third world riot crowds of our time distinctly and integrally links them to participatory democracy, population movements, and sprawling urbanization. The politicization of ethnicity, a hallmark of our time, tied to the politics of elections, has much to do with the winning of the benefits distributed by the modern state committed to welfare, development, and employment programs.4 This political equation, combined with the capabilities of the mass media, radio, television, and print capitalism, so effectively deployed in our time, makes present­day ethnic riot crowds very different from the crowds of preindustrial Europe I have referred to. The contrast is striking when we take into account the \"universalistic\" slogans of popular democracy that have been transplanted to the political arenas of newly independent states. Page 218 Keeping European comparisons in mind, we may now ask what relation the South Asian phenomena bear to the political crowds of postindustrial Western Europe? It has been argued that a great deal of the democratic politics of modern Europe is transacted according to long­implanted traditions and interests of social class, as evidenced by trade unions, professional associations, political parties, and the like, which as organized solidarities to a significant degree transcend cleavages of language, ethnicity, race, and even religion. By comparison, the ethnic conflicts we are concerned with here are less relatable to manifest social class differences and more attributable to ethnic concerns and interests acting as a monolithic principle, vertically integrating a people differentiated by class. If class interest enters at all, it seems as if the diverse interests within a people united by the discourse of ethnicity coalesce and converge for a while in pursuit of their different goals. The crowds of ethnic conflict thus on the one hand resemble the ''industrial crowds\" of modern Europe in engaging with participatory democracy, universal suffrage, and so on, but they on the other hand differ from them in action, finding their solidarity, not in divisive class interest, but in conceptions of collective ethnic identity whose continued salience and role, and adaptation and manipulation for winning collective entitlements and rewards, have to be given their proper weight. The interests of collective ethnic identity may link up with and be congruent to the converging interests of different \"class fractions,\" but this signifies, not class war, but class collaboration and manipulation by dominant elites. 5 One inevitably has to ask to what extent separatist movements in Eastern Europe today—the murderous animosities of Christian Armenians and Islamic Azerbaijanis, the conflicting claims of Croats, and Serbs, and Muslim Bosnians, and the fury of the Chechens—are activated by ethnic sentiments, solidarities, and techniques of mobilization similar to those operating in South Asian arenas. This question is further complicated in the case of Eastern Europe by the coincidence that ethnic crowds formed there at a time of aspirations to democratic politics, devolution and decentralization of power, and the loosening of authoritarian controls. Like ethnic riots of South Asia and elsewhere, the explosions currently taking place in Eastern Europe and what used to be the southern USSR also raise the issue of how we are to understand the human brutalities and killings, the looting and destruction of property, perpetrated by mobs. There are plausibly common elements in these eruptions. The politicized ethnic consciousness of today draws its intellectual, and, more important, Page 219 its emotional sustenance from appeals to religious, racial, linguistic, and territorial ties and mytho­historical claims. These are powerful forces for forming collectivities—they provide doctrine and legitimation, define and make self­conscious both personal and collective identity, and are effective boundary markers of collectivities in confrontation and conflict. The religious wars between Catholics and Protestants in Europe in earlier centuries fed on similar intensities: \"Religious violence is intense because it connects intimately with the fundamental values and self­definition of a community,\" Natalie Zemon Davis writes. 6 Class wars have not resulted in massacres and destruction of the magnitude manifested by wars of an ethnic, communal, or religious nature. And as I have remarked before, class interests and class fractions, whatever reality they have in South Asia, seem either to interact with ethnicity or, more visibly, to be submerged in a more potent collective identity that cuts vertically through classes to rally people under the banner of race, religion, language, and homeland. This collective identity simultaneously fuses individual selves and at least for short periods of time grants them personal identity as members of a homogeneous \"species.\" This \"substantialized' or concretized identity acquires its forcefulness by activating, instigating, or projecting so­called primordial sentiments onto the political arenas of twentieth­century politics. Aggregating in terms of ethnic possessions and claims enables collectivities to compete, bargain, and collide in the pursuit of power, material rewards, and prestige at a time when parochial village and local forms and networks of sociation are giving way to larger regional or communal forms and networks. It is simultaneously a time when the hopes and possibilities of making unitary nations and nation­states out of societies internally divided by a variety of actual or potential ethnic claims have been seriously eroded, if not shattered. This has happened primarily because the objective of forming nation­states has provided opportunities for some groups and coteries to monopolize the state apparatus and to dominate, incorporate, or even reduce to inferior status other groups, who feel that their portions are being jeopardized. Interestingly, both majority groups and minorities, elites and masses, may find themselves feeling \"victimized\" and ''beleaguered,\" depending on their share in the distribution of capital assets, educational advantages, occupational skills, and other forms of symbolic capital, on their patterns of urban­rural location, on their changing demographic proportions, and on the political arithmetic of majority rule and the formation of coalitions. But the haunting question remains: how does it come about that ethnonationalist collectivities intensify and transform their contests into Page 220 wars of mutual elimination or of total displacement, into acts of murder and physical expulsions of people? One cannot forget that the genocide of the Jews attempted by the Nazis was fueled by similar demonic urges. To borrow some words from Marx, which he used in a different context: how does it happen that the opposition of ethnonationalist groups \"should culminate in brutal contradiction, the shock of body against body, as its final dénouement?\" 7 Page 221 8 The Routinization and Ritualization of Violence There are three perspectives on collective violence in ethnic conflict that each in its own way and in its proper context provides illumination. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive and do in fact intersect. But each followed through to its ultimate does constitute a distinctive view. One approach views collective violence in the form of riots as \"eruptions\" with two facets. On the one hand, they are caused by underlying tensions and conflicts in the society, such as competition for scarce resources, educational opportunities, employment prospects, political power, and so on among groups or categories in a social arena—whether they be ethnic groups, communities, classes or fractions of classes. On the other hand, these eruptions are seen as breaching the norms and arrangements and boundaries of everyday social order, and therefore as extraordinary and \"excessive\" in nature. The metaphor that may apply here is that of fault lines in the social fabric, through which volcanoes erupt under stress. To some extent this perspective does fit some aspects of the accounts presented above. However, proponents of the breach­and­eruption perspective may actually differ as to whether the eruptions themselves are to be treated as irrational, destructive, and deserving of suppression or as purposive, directional, and positive in bringing about necessary social change (or as having both sets of implications). A second perspective, which may intersect in places with the first stated above, but that pushes the exploration of riots in a different direction, which we might call \"semiotic\" and \"performative,\" tries to see whether features of ethnic riots as collective behavior may be related to the wider context of political and moral norms, cultural practices and conventions, and traditions of public assemblies and public enactments, such as festi­ Page 222 vals, ceremonies, protests and rebellions. I have elsewhere elaborated three senses of what I understand to be the performative features of rituals and public events: the first is an extension of the Austinian sense of performative, wherein \"saying\" and naming something with words, voice modulations, gestures, and other kinesic movements is also doing and achieving effects as a legitimating conventional act with widely accepted public significance; the second is in the quite different sense of a staged sequential and recursive performance that uses multiple media and engages multiple sensory modalities by which the participants experience the event intensively and with heightened effect; and finally, there is the sense of \"indexical\" values (a concept derived from Charles Sanders Peirce) being existentially transferred to and inferred by the actors during the performance, thereby conferring on them prestige, legitimacy, authority, power, and other entitlements and forms of symbolic capital. 1 This semiotic and performative perspective thus illuminates the extent to which riots and associated contexts of collective violence are routinized, ritualized, and draw on the public culture's repertoire of presentational forms and practices; it also sensitizes us to the dynamic, elaborative, creative, constructive, and invented features of public events, by which participants relate to and address current issues and causes of contextual relevance and contingent and emergent circumstances, and also encounter unexpected open­ended outcomes. My own anthropological interests in ritual and in cultural semiotics set me on this path of interpretation, encouraged and informed by the writings of Thompson, Hobsbawm, Rudé, Natalie Zemon Davis, Tilly, and others. Then, in the summer of 1990, after I had embarked on this road,2 I began to read Sandria B. Freitag, whose work on urban riots in India under the British Raj in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, influenced by the genre of writings cited above, had likewise taken a direction I found informative. Riots, Freitag believes, should be linked \"to the larger world of collective activities in public spaces, involving crowds and rites, music and swordplay, sacred space and sacred time\"—that is, to a \"world often labelled by scholars as 'popular culture.' \" Referring specifically to Banaras, she remarks that \"in many respects, collective activities in public spaces constitute the heart of shared urban experience.\" But Banaras is not unique: \"Collective actions in the public spaces of an urban north Indian environment tended to be of three types: public space performances, collective ceremony, and popular protest. . . . Although distinct in ways, they developed out of shared cultural assumptions and, taken together, constitute a world that Page 223 should be considered a coherent whole and analyzed on its own terms. This world may best be described as composed of 'public arenas,' or activities that represent public expressions of collective values and motivations.\" 3 There is an important third perspective, which in a sense says something very different from the first perspective outlined above, and is closer in approach to the second. It applies in particular to situations of ethnic conflict that have become chronic. Conflict is not merely a situation of episodic and discontinuous riots with periods of peace and near­normal life in between; conflict has become an everyday and seemingly permanent state of affairs; it has turned into a state of civil war, in which the armed security forces of the state and armed rebels and opponents resort to violence as the primary vehicle of their dispute, so that it becomes a patterned mode of conducting politics by other means. I have suggested that the recent collective violence in the Punjab, the war between the Sri Lankan government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which is continuing (and with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna \\[JVP, or People's Liberation Front\\], which seems to have ended), the civil war in Kashmir, and the violent exchanges between Muhajirs, Sindhis, and the security forces in Karachi have virtually reached this state. Northern Ireland presents this condition of political warfare at its starkest. This third perspective, which has much to reveal, is impelled to focus on all the forms of collective violence being enacted, less as eruptions and results of underlying fissures and conflicts in the \"infrastructure,\" \"relations of production,\" or \"institutional structure\" of society, and more as a force and agency that has attained its own autonomy, has become \"a self­legitimating sphere of social discourse and transaction\" in its own right that actually structures and directs political action.4 The antagonists in this political warfare develop their own semiotics of violence: each side develops its repertoire of strategies and counterstrategies, actions, conventions, codes, and countercodes and espionage. All sides thus engage in a discourse of violence whose logic, techniques, strategies, and objectives they increasingly understand, anticipate, and counteract. The structuring role of this collective agonistic violence may reach a point at which it actually becomes efficacious in the construction, production, maintenance, and reproduction of ethnic identity and solidarity itself. What was previously seen as an effect now serves as a cause. Violence shapes the urban space of ethnic enclaves, barriers, shatter zones, liminal areas, barricades; it has become a mode of gaining or losing urban space, and of displacing, moving, and resettling populations. The organization, technology, and logistics of urban mass industrial production are adapted Page 224 and applied to clandestine war. The military operations and arsenal of the state's security forces are reproduced among guerrillas and insurgents who have devised their own command structure and cells, their bomb factories and arms dumps, and their offensive and defensive strategies. Elections and Violence In the course of this study of recent ethnic riots I increasingly realized that the manner in which political elections were staged, and violent events before, during, and after them, were germane to my subject of routinization and ritualization of collective violence. So as a prelude to this topic, let me recall three examples of recent election violence drawn from three different South Asian countries. Bangladesh Local government elections were held in Bangladesh in 1988 to select more than 44,000 mayors and members of local councils. The keenness of participation in the elections can be gauged from the fact that more than 133,000 people sought posts on 4,376 village councils. Bangladesh has a population of about 105 million people. The councils in question serve for three years and are chiefly responsible for development activities at the local level. Supporters of rival candidates in local elections battled each other with rocks, guns, and homemade bombs today, and 80 people were reported killed and hundreds wounded across the country. The death toll was based on reports from the police, hospitals, and journalists in outlying villages. They also said the injury toll could exceed 2,000. The police said more than 200 people were arrested. Voting was suspended at dozens of polling places because of the violence. . . . Some sites were ransacked, and ballots were stolen in others. 5 Less than a month later, national parliamentary elections were held in Bangladesh in similar circumstances: Rival party workers fighting with guns, knives, and bombs killed 13 people and wounded scores of others in Bangladesh during elections today, police officials said. Groups of up to several hundred men fought battles in several cities, and opponents of President H. M. Ershad \\[a former lieutenant general, who had seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982\\] tried to enforce a general strike to disrupt the parliamentary and municipal elections. The 12 party opposition alliance boycotting the election had called the polls a farce and urged the country's 46 million electorate not to vote. Voting at 170 polling places had been suspended because of ballot rigging, violence, or lack of election officials. The voting was to be rescheduled Page 225 there. The electoral commissioner said he could not detail the extent of fraud but added: \"It was as if I was seeing an election in England. It was almost peaceful.\" President Ershad, who had \"been under increasing pressure to leave office since November, when the main opposition parties agreed to settle their differences and begin a campaign of strikes and protests,\" ordered the deployment of 9,000 troops to monitor the voting. The streets of Dhaka were nearly empty, and shops were shuttered because of the 36­hour general strike. Near Dhaka University, people demonstrating against the Ershad government burned vehicles and set a fire station ablaze \"after police who had been besieged in the building fled.\" Ershad's Jatiya Party was leading in 41 of the 49 parliamentary seats for which partial results had been announced. The party was expected to win 245 of the 300 seats that were being contested. Ershad rejected the demands of the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party for his resignation. Asked whether he expected the unrest to continue, he replied, \"After this things certainly will improve.\" 6 India The second example concerns the November 1989 Indian elections to the Lok Sabha, which Rajiv Gandhi lost, enabling V. P. Singh and his coalition government to assume power. There were widespread charges of violence and corrupt practices obstructing the holding of democratic elections. Allegations were made that in Rajiv Gandhi's own constituency of Amethi, in Uttar Pradesh, policemen had been seen stuffing ballot boxes, and that the headquarters of the Janata Dal Party were ransacked. In the same constituency, the leader of a party of untouchables, Kanshi Ram, was shot in the arm during a scuffle with Congress Party (I) supporters; and Sanjay Singh, a nephew of the leader of the Janata Dal Party (V. P. Singh), was shot and wounded. It was reported that, on the first day of elections, \"armed gangs roamed through the constituency of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, terrorizing voters.\"7 It seems that the opponents of Congress (I) did not spurn similar intimidation and obstruction of polling. On the first day of voting, some twenty people died, and several dozen were wounded in election­related violence throughout the country. \"In Srinagar, on India's northwestern border with Pakistan, antigovernment Muslim militants set fire to several polling stations and planted bombs near the homes of party members supporting the coalition between Prime Minister Gandhi's Congress Party and the locally based National Conference of Chief Minister Faroo Abdullah.\" In Andhra Page 226 Pradesh, another opposition­controlled state, \"election officials threw out ballots from 125 polling stations and called for new voting on Friday. The officials said that unnamed politicians had snatched voting papers and ballot boxes.\" 8 Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, violence before, during, and after elections has been a common occurrence since before independence, but has subsequently increased in intensity and frequency. It reached an unprecedented level at the time of the first referendum held in December 1982 by President J. R. Jayewardene to get the electorate's approval of an extension of the term of the sitting Parliament by six years. On October 22, Jayewardene had been reelected president, which apparently gave him the power and leverage to take this step. The referendum itself was a novel and highly controversial move, undertaken to prolong the tenure of the incumbent members of Parliament, especially those of the United National Party, which then held 84 percent of the seats. In the event, the government's victory was narrow (54.66 percent in favor; 45.34 percent against), and was secured by resort to blatant thuggery and electoral infractions more extreme and effective than the opposition parties could muster. Ironically enough, the referendum was justified by Jayewardene as a means of saving the nation from \"a Naxalite type of people, bent on violence.\"9 The Conduct of the Campaign A state of emergency had already been declared on October 20, ostensibly to check violence after the presidential election held earlier, which Jayewardene had won more or less fairly and squarely. \"Under emergency regulation important opposition newspapers were banned, printing presses were sealed, opposition meetings were restricted and many opposition organizers and supporters and other critics of the government detained or arrested and interrogated. \"The Referendum Act prohibited the display of flags, banners, and posters in public except on the premises when a meeting was being held and only on the day of that meeting. The government party's symbol (a lamp) and other propaganda devices were openly displayed, while the same privilege was virtually denied opposition groups by hostile police. \"The increasing partisanship of the police . . . rendered opposition workers and 'pot' \\[the opposition's symbol\\] voters extremely vulnerable in the face of intimidation by government supporters,\" Priya Samarakone notes.10 The government party seemed so omnipotent that neither the police nor the elections commissioner felt able to move against it. Page 227 The agents of the government successfully harassed the cadres of the chief opposition party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. One destabilizing tactic employed was the temporary arrest and detention of the SLFP's key organizers, including its general secretary. Other key party workers, such as the assistant secretary and his wife, were subjected to interrogation as the \"main culprits\" in an alleged \"Naxalite plot,\" which was never proven to exist. Arrest and interrogation was an ordeal faced by opposition party workers at all levels. \"On many occasions, meetings were broken up by groups of government supporters, with the police watching but taking no action, or even protecting the disruptive elements.\" For example, in Kurunegala, an opposition meeting was disturbed by hooligans led by a UNP member of Parliament, and \"the police intervened only to protect the MP when the crowd tried to eject the troublemakers,\" Samarakone observes. Several such disruptions were reported, and the active participation of MPs in such disruptions and the partiality of the police were not unusual. The banning of opposition newspapers and the sealing of their presses was another tactic adopted by the ruling UNP, while the state­owned newspapers and printing establishments flooded the country with government propaganda. This action against presses publishing on behalf of the opposition had already begun at the time of the presidential election and was carried further during the referendum. Suthanthiran, a Tamil­ language opposition newspaper produced in Jaffna, was closed for preparing to print the Tamil­language text of a message to the Tamil people from Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the leader of the SLFP. Aththa, a Communist Party newspaper with wide circulation among the Sinhala­reading public, was closed for criticizing the referendum proposal itself. The state­controlled media—radio, television, and major newspapers—promoted the government's cause. The major dailies of Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd., such as the Daily News, and of the Times Group, such as the Daily Mirror, both owned by the state, not only carried government views but engaged in character assassination of politicians and lay leaders who opposed the referendum. Similarly, broadcasting and television time, which was available for only a limited time at a high price to the opposition, was freely and amply available to the ruling party. In addition to existing propagandistic films and edited news broadcasts, several new programs were launched \"to acquaint the masses with the performance of each minister in the interests of the common man.\" 11 Television time was denied to independent organizations such as the Civil Rights Movement and theoretically available for a period of 45 min­ Page 228 utes only to \"recognized political parties.\" A state­produced film praising the government's effort began its screening on November 21, and on December 17, the National Film Exhibitors Guild presented President Jayewardene with a copy of Towards the Dharmishta Society, \"which was screened that day in Sinhalese and English in cinemas in every district of the country.\" 12 The Conduct of the Polling Opposition campaigners had already faced threats and obstruction, and intimidation and thuggery increased as the election drew near, reaching a peak on the polling day itself. It appears, for example, that in the face of widespread intimidation, the SLFP Central Committee of Attanagalla electoral district decided to withdraw all its polling observers from the forty­seven stations in the electorate. Many opposition polling observers were taken into custody on false complaints, and were usually released two or three days after the poll. For example, SLFP observers in Yatinuwara (Kandy District) suffered this fate. The left­wing parties were subjected to similar harassment. On election day, threats against and physical assaults on opposition polling observers apparently resulted in their totally vacating the polling stations in many places. There were several recorded instances of intimidation of public servants administering the polls. As usual, organized mass impersonation was practiced, the secrecy of the ballot was violated at some polling stations, and many opposition supporters were prevented from reaching or frightened away from the polling booths. In his official report, printed as a sessional paper, the commissioner of elections confirms many of these allegations in moderate and guarded language: The Commissioner of Elections and Inspector­General of Police received representation on the 16th December that some Agents/Polling observers expressed doubt about their safety and requested that those assigned to this Polling Division be withdrawn. This withdrawal was officially intimated to the Commissioner of Elections and the Inspector­ General of Police one day before the poll. Alleged reason for such withdrawal was lack of security . . . and fear of intimidation and reprisals. Consequently they claim to have advised Agents not to attend the Polling Stations. . . . However divergent the interpretations could be, yet it becomes rather difficult in these circumstances, to deny the allegation that the failure to maintain the expected law and order in general and more specifically on the day of the poll, partly at least would have been the reason for the failure of some Polling Observers to assert their rights and be present at the Police Stations. . . . Page 229 The police assistance to the Elections Staff in the management of a Polling Station, therefore becomes indispensable. Allegations were made at the Referendum, that some impersonators had escaped while some were forcibly rescued, marked Ballot Papers were displayed by voters, Polling Observers had left the Polling Stations for lack of safety, and at times outside elements had disturbed the working of the Polling Stations. These allegations should not be dismissed as mere expression of disappointment and rancor. 13 The Referendum of December 1982 reached a high­water mark in election violence and introduced some new excesses. The open display of marked ballot papers, removal of opposition polling observers, or their total withdrawal from polling stations, and unconcealed intimidation of public servants administering the referendum were probably new developments. And perhaps never before had the police shown active partiality to such a degree or demonstrated such unwillingness to enforce the law. It seems not entirely accidental that the worst ethnic riots in the history of Sri Lanka took place in 1983, only six months or so after the referendum. ''The fact that violence has been used to meet criticism and political dissent in the country as a whole, including the Sinhala areas, may well have encouraged the belief among certain sections of the population that the ethnic problem could be dealt with in a similar manner,\" a document put out by the Civil Rights Movement in Sri Lanka observed.14 A new set of developments characterized the presidential election of 1988. Two insurgent groups, the LTTE (Tigers) in the north and east, and the JVP in the south (and in certain other places, such as Matale and Anuradhapura), the latter group in particular, exercised widespread intimidation and violence to prevent citizens from voting. Furthermore, on the government side, the police and, more weightily, the army were deployed, ostensibly to protect voters and to ensure that the elections would be held and completed. But as usual the security forces also used violence, and both the UNP and the opposition parties resorted to the usual election stunts and violations. In the event, the election was held and completed. The UNP's Ranasinghe Premadasa was elected president. But the pattern of voting and the variations in voter turnout indicated that the JVP and the LTTE were successful in keeping many people from voting in those constituencies in which they were concentrated. All this underscores a point made before: that the Sinhala­Tamil ethnic riots since 1956 are part and parcel of the violence, political tensions, and economic inequities in the country as a whole. The JVP insurrection by Sinhala youth, in some ways a mirror image of the Tamil rebellion, was Page 230 also generated by the defects of the island's political economy. Seen in this perspective, the brutalities of ethnic violence are an intensified and explosive version of the violence in other domains. This also applies to occurrences of ethnic violence in virtually all the instances outside of Sri Lanka alluded to above. The Repertoire of Collective Violence The concepts of routinization and, more important, ritualization of collective violence may help us to perceive some of the organized, anticipated, programmed, and recurring features and phases of seemingly spontaneous, chaotic, and orgiastic actions of the mob as aggressor and victimizer. These concepts should also go some way toward describing the syntactic features of ethnic riots, without claiming that they exhaust the contingent events of their pragmatic significance. Some of the components of this repertoire may well be drawn from the everyday forms of ritualized life and from the ritual calendar of festivities. They may be imitated, inverted, or parodied, according to their dramatic and communicative possibilities. Since these features are recurrent, either the same actors, or actors who as contemporaries have social links or intergenerational ties with previous actors, participate in them and reproduce them time and again. Focus on routinization and ritualization may also help us to comprehend why brutalities committed as a member of an inflamed mob pursuing what it considers to be a \"righteous\" political cause on behalf of the collectivity (whether it be an ethnic group or nationality) may not take a crippling psychic toll on the aggressor at the level of the individual/self. And why, after bouts of violence, the participants seemingly return to their normal daily lives and continue to live side by side with their erstwhile enemies. 15 There is little evidence that as aggressors and victimizers—in Colombo, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, and elsewhere—rioters experience a collective malaise after the event or are in any overt sense burdened with concerns and reactions that impede their return to everyday life, although that return may be one of increasing unease. It is noteworthy that reports on riots, whether by official commissions, nongovernmental agencies, or the media, do not address this issue: they neither ask the question nor seek information about it. To mobilize crowd action, manage mobs, and manipulate the media, politicians, faction leaders, and the professional thugs who can be hired for Page 231 the purpose deploy specific recipes, techniques, and stratagems. Elections are spectacles and contests of power; they are the performative enactment of power; they provide the pomp, terror, drama, and climaxes of crowd politics. Clifford Geertz's sketch of the traditional theater state, 16 which portrays state rituals as passively imaging the cosmic scheme, could be strengthened and energized by elucidation of the procedures and mechanisms used for domesticating and managing large crowds and persuading them to become adherents of the established order. Transposed and adapted to modern participatory democracy, the idea of the theater state will find in political elections an informative example of how participants are mobilized and deliberately urged to heightened action, which by an agonistic buildup eventuates in violent eruptions and spectacles—literal dances of death—before, during, and after elections. (Writing on religious riots in sixteenth­century France, Natalie Zemon Davis remarks: \"We may see violence, however cruel, not as random and limitless, but as aimed at defined targets and selected from a repertory of traditional punishments and forms of destruction.\")17 The following examples of components that might form part of a manual of communal violence in South Asia (and many places elsewhere) are frequently combined in the production of public events imbued with violence: 1. Processions prominently displaying portraits of public figures and carrying emotive public symbols such as black flags, Buddhist flags, and placards with inflammatory slogans (which are also vociferously and rhythmically chanted).18 Among public figures and charismatic persons today, some of the most effective crowd drawers and mobilizers are varieties of \"holy men,\" be they Buddhist monks, Hindu sadhus (mendicant ascetics), Muslim ulama, or even Indian film stars who by virtue of having played the roles of gods in the cinema have become quasi­divine in the public's eye themselves (such as Rama Rao of Andhra Pradesh and the late M.G. Ramachandran of Tamil Nadu). Processions as public spectacle are surrounded and witnessed by \"slow crowds\" of spectators. Exhibitionism on the one side and admiring spectatorship on the other are the reciprocal components of spectacle. 2. Rallies that conclude with public speeches given in large open spaces (see figures 6 and 7). A core component of mass oratory is the vigorous declamation of stereotyped orations composed of stock formulae and peppered with mytho­historical allusions, inflated boasts, group defamation, and scurrilous insults to and insinuations against opponents. These orations are transmitted and amplified to earsplitting decibels with the aid Page 232 Figure 6. Indira Gandhi at an election rally on her behalf around 1981. India Today. of microphones, loudspeakers, and, nowadays, television and VCRs. This kind of noisy propaganda contributes effectively to the \"demonization\" of the enemy and feelings of omnipotence and righteousness among the participants as representatives of an ethnic group or race. 3. Standardized forms of intimidation of the opponent, examples of which are obstructions by thugs at voting booths; throwing of bombs at public places and meetings; hate mail, including threats of assassination; and actual, selective cautionary murders. Some years ago, on a visit to Harvard University, Ambassador Karan Singh referred to the \"criminalization of politics\" in India, an apt phrase, so long as we remember that criminality too can become routinized. 4. Distribution of bribes, usually monetary rewards, liquor, caps, shirts, flags, and so on, to \"buy\" votes and \"inspire\" workers and supporters. Although officially labeled \"corruption,\" this is standard lubrication for the political process and facilitates the movement of crowds. It would seem that the exercise of democracy is an expensive business, and that it too generates its characteristic networks of patronage and forms of ''alliance,\" protection, incorporation, and mobilization. 5. An array of \"triggering actions\" that are publicly recognized as challenges, slights, insults, and desecrations inviting reprisal. Page 233 Figure 7. A rally with posters staged on behalf of Rajiv Gandhi. Sharad Saxena (India Today). Page 234 Triggering Events W. Norman Brown observed that the precipitating causes of Hindu­Muslim riots in nineteenth­century India \"might be a quarrel over ownership of a parcel of land and the right to erect a religious building on it, or the playing of music by a Hindu wedding procession as it passed a mosque where such a noise constituted sacrilege, or exaction of exorbitant rent or interest by a landlord or money­lender of one religious persuasion from a tenant or debtor of the other, or sacrifice of a cow by Muslims, or the clash of crowds when a Hindu and a Muslim festival coincided.\" 19 By one account, in the years 1900–1922, there were sixteen communal riots in India; from 1923 to 1926, there were seventy­two.20 They were usually triggered by irritation caused to Hindus by the slaughter of cows and to Muslims by the playing of music in front of mosques. But such disputes have a history extending back at least to late medieval times. There is evidence that religious riots did occur widely in India between 1770 and 1860, although one must bear in mind that what is labeled a religious riot may in fact—in addition to whatever differences in religious practices and norms may become salient in that context—involve a number of other interests and differences, whose contention and resolution are also at the heart of the matter.21 Diverse issues and the interests of multiple groups are involved in movements of collective violence that are retrospectively labeled and perceived as collisions between two monolithic population segments: Muslims versus Sinhalese, Hindus versus Muslims, and so on. That in retrospective summation the complex issues and diverse participants who participated in the events summarized as \"riots\" are reduced to a master principle of religious or ethnic allegiance is itself an important fact, whether that labeling is done by colonial rulers, independent governments, \"ruling elites,\" or the \"lower classes.\" Apropos of the 1809 riots in Banaras (focused initially on the Lat Bhairava shrine) and the anti­tax agitation of 1810–11, Gyanendra Pandey devastatingly deconstructs \"the communal riot narrative\" adopted by the British colonial regime—stereotyped depiction of a permanent \"religious\" divide between Muslims and Hindus, construction of a diachrony into which the events of \"riots\" fitted, and \"the description of violence as a means of describing native character\"—by which diverse events and episodes in Indian politics were emptied of their \"specific variations of time, place, class, issue'' and reduced to the play of religious differences between the Hindus and Muslims.22 Based on her \"public culture\" approach, Sandria Freitag says of the 1809 riots in Banaras between Hindus and Page 235 Muslims over the Bharat Milap shrine: \"Beyond the overt level of symbolism that classifies this conflict as 'religious' lie further meanings. From this vantage point, the specific identification of the combatants, not as 'Hindus' and 'Muslims' but as Marathas, Rajputs, Gosains, and weavers, becomes significant. Thus while not denying the religious characterization, we can find much additional meaning by placing these acts in the larger context of the political economy of Banaras at the turn of the century.\" 23 The so­called \"Cow Protection Riots of 1893\" offer another example of such labeling. These riots were preceded by movements to protect the sacred cow in the late 1880s and early 1890s in Uttar Pradesh. At a general level, the movements and the riots were focused on a religious issue and mobilized Hindus against \"a common 'Other' of Muslims.\" They first manifested themselves in cities and towns such as Kanpur, Lucknow, Gazipur, Aligarh, Banaras, and, above all, Allahabad, where they engaged both reformist elites and neighborhood populations; in the next phase, they engaged the surrounding rural areas, where they intermeshed with the parochial rural interests of dispersed village populations, militating against the more unified impact made in the cities and towns.24 Pandey argues that the clashes in Azamgarh, Ghazipur, and Ballia in 1893, and those in Shahabal twenty­five years later, reveal bitter antagonism between the dominant Hindu upper castes and Hindu lower castes seeking greater social mobility, and that there were simultaneously class issues that cut across the religious divide and united Hindus and Muslims on social and economic grounds. It is thus difficult to maintain that the anatagonism of Hindus and Muslims was the primary contradiction in the region.25 In the late 1980s, a television series called Tamas (Darkness), which portrayed and revived memories of the brutalities and violence of the early years of Partition (and by implication also addressed more recent clashes between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs), stirred disputes and violence in India, including demonstrations in several cities and an attack on a television station. The series began with scenes bound to agitate both Muslims and Hindus: \"In the opening sequence . . . a low caste Hindu is hired by a sinister Hindu businessman to kill a pig, which is then placed in front of a mosque as a provocation to Moslems.\" In reply, a cow is slaughtered, \"inflaming the Hindus and setting off a cycle of revenge in which the town is set ablaze and innocents are slain.\"26 In the recent past, violence and riots between the Sikhs and Hindus in the Punjab have been triggered by acts of ritual desecration. In the middle of political turmoil in 1982, with the talks between the Akali Dal politicians and the central government bogged down, radical young Sikhs, members Page 236 of the Dal Khalsa, carrying guns adopted shock tactics to force people to take sides: \"Just before dawn on the hot morning of 26 April, the bleeding heads of two cows were found in front of a Hindu temple in Amritsar. . . . The rioting in Amritsar following the discovery of the cows' heads resulted in one death and a 24­hour curfew. In retaliation, packets of cigarettes were tossed into Sikh gurudwaras \\[temples\\] to defile them \\[Sikhs spurn tobacco\\], and rioting spread to twenty Punjab towns.\" 27 Speaking of a standard form of ritual desecration and its devastating effect, Uma Chakravarty and Nandita Haksar cite the anguish of a Sikh named Balwant Singh at the burning of his gurudwara before his eyes: \"His deep hurt at finding that someone had urinated on the Guru Granth Sahib \\[the sacred scriptures\\] has perhaps not been captured in our translation,\" they observe.28 Such symbolic challenges, which are calculated to inflame, and fiendishly embellished and distorted by rumors, can rapidly spawn a spiraling tornado of violence. Rumors and Distorted News Among the components that figure in the mounting and the staging of ethnic riots (as in many other forms of crowd violence), mischievously and recklessly planted rumors attributing evil intentions and diabolical acts of outrage to the enemy have the dubious honor of inflaming the aggressor to orgasms of destructive violence. Rumors thus have a twofold character. On the one hand, they are a standard and expectable item in crowds formed for mass action against a nominated enemy. Most often the \"stories\" they relay cluster around themes and issues repeated again in history in diverse places and time. They relate to horrors such as the raping and disemboweling of pregnant women, the poisoning of public wells and water supply, and other standard kinds of desecrations and violations. At a time of charged emotions, such reports, repeated again and again, are seen as highly credible, although subsequently recognized, after the storm, to be improbable. They cause panic and paranoia, and they are also a product of fear and panic. They are believed at a time when distanced skepticism and critical evaluation are scarce, and when individuals are at the greatest risk of being provoked by one another into a state of collective frenzy. And to compound the matter, rumors planted by \"riot captains\" and agents provocateurs are circulated by the media and, in the telling and relaying, become elaborated and further distorted, in turn spawning other rumors. In time, it is virtually impossible to find out where and when and by whom a rumor was begun. In the end, the panic and fury rumors cause lead to the perpetration Page 237 of horrendous acts of the very kind attributed to that enemy. Rumors can thus be self­fulfilling. Just to keep in mind that we are not dealing with a peculiarly Asian diversion, recall a classic case. The cholera epidemic of Paris in 1832 coincided with the workers' armed insurrection of June of that year. \"The cholera claimed 39,000 victims, many of them from the crowded streets and tenements adjoining the central markets and Hôtel de Ville. It was widely rumored that the government or the bourgeoisie had deliberately infected the wells and poisoned the inmates of the hospitals and prisons.\" 29 One of the frightening aspects of our so­called revolution in mass media communications is that partisan newspapers and radio broadcasts by hasty commentators, or even calculating political leaders, can relay unconfirmed reports of incidents, many of them rumors or distortions of facts, and selective information about events, foregrounding the blame that accrues to the \"enemy\" and withholding blame that one's own side deserves. Such inflammatory news reaches thousands instantly and travels on with embellishments by word of mouth among gathering crowds. When television and radio are centralized government monopolies, and government controls the flow of news, both selective reporting and censorship contribute to the propagation of tendentious information. Thus both official and unofficial inquiries into the anti­Sikh riots in Delhi in 1984 following the assassination of Indira Gandhi have highlighted a number of noteworthy features.30 One is the mischievous, indeed diabolical, role of rumors. Rumors that the New Delhi water supply had been poisoned are said to have been broadcast from loudspeaker vans, and they were thereafter relayed around New Delhi by telephone. There were rumors, too, that Sikhs had large caches of weapons stored in their gurudwaras. Sikhs allegedly distributed sweets to celebrate Mrs. Gandhi's death and jubilantly danced the bhangra, a Punjabi dance associated with festivals. (In fact, this story seems to have begun when some college students, who had been preparing to stage a performance for a month, were noticed rehearsing on the day Mrs. Gandhi was killed.) A rumor, which reversed the actual truth, was that trains arriving in Delhi were filled with the corpses of assassinated Hindu passengers. Television also provided some of the essential ingredients of the riots. Television as a natural medium has spread across India only since 1980. Indeed, at the end of 1984, the government claimed proudly that 70 percent of the population was at last within range of a television signal. That signal is highly controlled. Most of the programming still emanates from New Delhi, another mark of the centralization of the Indian state which Mrs. Gandhi Page 238 fostered. In the wake of her assassination, the national television and radio networks repeatedly identified her killers as Sikhs. Television showed scenes of the crowds at the place where her body lay in state. Some people shouted slogans: \"Blood for blood!\" 31 The ethnic riots in Sri Lanka provide another graphic example of the havoc caused by rumors and tendentious political statements. The rumors swirling around when some students and I were trapped in Gal Oya in 1956 during the first postindependence riots, such as the story of the raping of a young woman, followed by her exposure naked in the street, the imagined invasion of a mythical army, and the frenzied flight of the original aggressors, have already been described in chapter 4. Rumor also helped to raise the passions of the Sinhalese public in other cases, however. One of the incidents associated with the riots of 1958, the second outbreak of Sinhalese aggression against Tamils, and by far the most violent and destructive up to that date, involved the Tamil Federal Party's plans to hold its annual convention in Vavuniya in the north to rethink its strategy after the failure to implement the Bandaranaike­Chelvanayagam pact. The preparations of the Federalists to travel to Vavuniya to attend the convention were retailed to the Sinhalese public in grossly distorted form as a threatened invasion by Tamils from Trincomalee and from Batticoaloa to capture and occupy the historic Sinhalese capitals of Amuradhapura and Polonnaruwa! This spurred the Sinhalese to attack a train from Batticoaloa that was supposed to be carrying the Tamil invaders when it arrived at the railway station at Polonnaruwa. A spate of violence was subsequently unleashed in Polonnaruwa town. As the violence spread from Polonnaruwa to the eastern provinces, the prime minister, Mr. Bandaranaike, made a broadcast to the nation. \"By a strangely inexplicable perversion of logic . . . \\[he\\] tried to explain away a situation by substituting the effect for a cause,\" Tarzie Vittachi observes. In the course of the broadcast, Bandaranaike said: \"Certain incidents in the Batticaloa District where some people lost their lives, including Mr. D. A. Seneviratne, a former \\[Sinhalese\\] Mayor of Nuwara Eliya, have resulted in various acts of violence and lawlessness in other areas—for example Polonnaruwa, Dambulla, Galawela, Kuliyapitiya and even Colombo\" (emphasis in original). Vittachi comments: ''The killing of Seneviratne on May 25 was thus officially declared to be the cause of the uprising, although the communal riots had begun on May 22 with the attack on the Polonnaruwa. Station and the wrecking of the Batticoaloa­Colombo train.\" Soon enough widespread arson occurred in the business sections of Colombo and in provincial towns of the southwest. \"The cry everywhere in the Sinhalese Page 239 districts was 'avenge the murder of Seneviratne'. Even the many Sinhalese who had been appalled by the goonda attacks on Tamils and Tamil owned kiosks, now began to feel that the Tamils had put themselves beyond the pale. . . . The Prime Minister's peace call to Nations had turned into a war cry.\" 32 Meanwhile, other fabrications were wreaking havoc: A female teacher from Panadura, the story went, who was teaching in a school in the Batticoaloa District, had been set upon by a gang of Tamil thugs. They had cut off her breasts and killed her. Her body was being brought home to Panadura for cremation. . . . In the bazaar \\[at Panadura\\] there was sudden pandemonium. The goondas \\[thugs\\] intensified their depredations. They ransacked Tamil­owned shops and beat up shopkeepers and passers­by. A gang of goondas rushed into the Hindu temple, and attempted to set fire to it. . . . They pulled an officiating priest out of the Kovil and burnt him into cinder.33 When the Ministry of Education examined its records, it found that there was no female teacher from Panadura on the staff of any school in the Batticoaloa District. Examples from South Asia and all over the world of distorted communication adding fuel to the fires of internecine conflict can easily be multiplied to confirm the role of rumors in creating stereotypes, causing panic, and serving as justification for brutalities. Richard Lambert documents, for example, how a tendentious campaign conducted by the press in India and Pakistan fed into the gathering storm in Calcutta and the subsequent Hindu­Muslim riots of 1949–50. A spiral of alarm, beginning with stories of looting of merchants' houses in Dhaka, countered by allegations about the East Bengal government's forcible occupation of Indian homes, and followed by stories of mass requisition of houses and the forced participation of Hindu children in Muslim prayers in East Bengal schools, eventually climaxed with \"stories of molested women.\"34 Processions and Parades Processions and parades, especially of a religious character or in celebration of national holidays, are usually fixed in a religious calendar. And especially in the case of the religious calendars of contiguous religious communities, it is not infrequent that different festivals calling for processions may fall at the same time. It is not unknown for the merrymaking of the Holi festival of the Hindus and the Shia Muslims' Muharram processions to be staged on the same days. In periods of benign coexistence, it is not unusual in India for Sunni Muslims to join in the Muharram celebrations of the Shias, as happened in Lucknow in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and for Muslims to participate in the annual festivals of a Hindu guardian deity, and so Page 240 on. 35 But in times of ethnic tension, processions predictably trigger violence between polarized communities, especially when they traverse the other's territory. Thus festival calendars can at sensitive times actually channel and direct the shape, expression, timing, and spatial location of ethnic violence. Sometimes the building of a new mosque or temple in an urban space where the community doing the building is gaining in strength and affluence has implications for the conversion of a neighborhood or locality that to start with was mixed, but is now on the way to becoming an exclusive enclave. Writing of Northern Ireland, Allen Feldman explains how it is that to march in and through an area is to lay claim to it: The typical spatial pattern of \\[Protestant and Catholic\\] parades is the movement from the center of the community (physical and/or symbolic), where the parade audience is ethnically homogeneous, to a march along the boundaries demarcating an adjacent community of the opposed ethnic grouping. Marching along the boundaries transforms the adjacent community into an involuntary audience and an object of defilement through the aggressive display of political symbols and music. . . . Ceremonial marches are important in the Catholic communities, but in the Loyalist (Protestant) community they are an axial rite. Among Loyalists marchers there is a tradition of \"taking\" a new street and incorporating it into the parade route. These new routes are either on the boundary or actually within the territory of adjacent Catholic communities. In the next year's marches, these new routes are vehemently defended from Loyalist incursions by outraged Catholics or the police. In the Loyalist community these parades synthesize historical symbolisms, the command of space, and boundary transgression. Violence symbolized or practiced, in this performative context is identified as the appropriate medium for colonizing the outer margins of community space, while kinship and residential structures are reserved as the central ordering apparatuses of the internal community proper.36 Processions and marches are not, of course, confined to the format of religious calendars and national holidays. Aside from processions at life­cycle rites such as marriages and funerals, they are standard when a public statement in a public arena is thought necessary, as in staging protests, strikes, and demonstrations; and in the course of electioneering and celebrating victories at the polls. Moreover, the actual enactment of politics is done in the form of competing and agonistic processions, public meetings, and oratorical rebuttals. The more the marchers, the louder their slogans, the more macho their getup, the more \"powerful\" the politician. In May 1981, the All­India Sikh Students Federation, led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale's confidant, Amrik Singh, began a campaign to ban the sale of tobacco within the walled city of Amritsar. Hindu traders objected, and a Hindu­led pro­cigarette procession of 10,000, some carrying Page 241 swords, marched through Amritsar on 19 May. On 31 May, 20,000 Sikhs, many brought in from the countryside by appeals from Bhindranwale, and almost all armed, paraded through the city. To understand this spiral of more and fiercer­looking processionists, one has to know that Sikhs spurn tobacco, while Hindus are not subject to this taboo. In the past, the question of smoking had not posed problems, but now it did. (As mentioned above, on another occasion, Hindus polluted Sikhs' sacred space by flinging tobacco into their gurudwara.) In the above example, processions were an integral medium, and indeed a primary form, in which an explosive religio­political issue was enacted. Any of these agonistic counterstatements could explode at one moment or another, both predictably and unpredictably, into a violent collision, a few killings, or even trigger a large riot. Processions can be precursors of violence as well as actually develop into riots, and both politicians and religious leaders, who are often both, know their histrionic value as well as their instrumental efficacy in defining and inscribing the region or territory being claimed as an ethnic group's homelands. In these days of motorized transport, loudspeakers, and mobile film and video shows, the spaces that are traversed and laid claim to can be vast. Bhindranwale's dramatic rise to political eminence in the Punjab was owing in part to his unflagging traveling in his bus along the network of newly constructed village roads and in part to his effective use of mass media and the expanding vernacular press at a time of dramatically rising literacy. Festivals, Rallies and Violence: An Illustration from Kashmir Kashmir, a princely state during the British Raj, was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were separated in 1947. The city of Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The fact that the majority of the people of this state were Muslim (in 1980, Muslims constituted 64 percent of the state's population of 5 million) made for contention between Hindus and Muslims from the beginning. For some four decades, Muslim activists, especially the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, have been agitating for secession from India and union with Pakistan. More recently, many of the militants have demanded independence and the status of a neutral country. It was also virtually inevitable that from the beginning Pakistan and India would be at loggerheads over border issues and Pakistan's alleged en­ Page 242 couragement of the cause of the secessionists. India has already fought three wars with Pakistan. And India has accused Pakistan of arming and training and harboring Muslim militants from Jammu and Kashmir. The demands and protests leading to violence, after a period of relative quiet, intensified in the early months of 1990. My reference to Kashmir at this point is not so much to give an informed account of its politics of secession but to illustrate some points made earlier about the repertoire of signs, devices, and strategies, such as processions, rallies, orations, and rumors, that is used to stage and enact mass politics. Furthermore, it is relevant that many of these components also constitute traditional festivals. It is, therefore, on the cards that festivals, rallies, demonstrations, and riots may spill over into one another as collective enactments, involving the participation of crowds experiencing heightened sensibilities. 37 The turmoil in Kashmir in the early months of 1990 offers a good illustration of the overlaps, conjunctions, and processes of spillover between festivals and mass politics and collective violence. To make my point, I shall manipulate the chronology somewhat by describing a later set of events before preceding ones. \"Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets of Srinagar today to press demands for independence for the predominantly Muslim border region,\" the New York Times reported in February 1990. \"It was the largest demonstration in decades.\" For the first time in seven weeks, ''the state government lifted the curfew in the city today to allow the marches to take place. The demonstrations also coincided with a major Muslim festival and a Hindu festival. Large gatherings are expected at mosques and temples to mark the separate occasions later tonight.\" Many joined the processions after the noon prayers at the mosques scattered across the city. \"Flags of the Kashmir Liberation Front fluttered from shops, roofs, and even a police­control point.\" Some demonstrators had traveled from the town of Anantnag, about thirty miles away. Wearing their traditional loose gowns (phirin), they sat on the tops of buses waving the green, white, and red flags of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and shouting slogans favoring independence. Thousands of protesters streamed into the heart of the city, largely on foot. According to a senior police official around 400,000 people—more than half the population of Srinagar city—were in the streets. The protesters eventually converged on the office of the United Nations military observers, where they delivered statements demanding a plebiscite in the Indian­controlled zone (and also in the adjoining area under Pakistani control, called Azad). Young men Page 243 shouted slogans from the roof of a building opposite the UN office, while men and women waved flags as they walked about. Near the UN office, \"young men served sweet watery milk to demonstrators from large drums.\" So far, the police, armed with bamboo staves and a few rifles, had watched quietly from a distance and had not intervened. Few paramilitary troops were visible. 38 The festival atmosphere and the boisterous, but still peaceful, rallies and demonstrations were actually an interlude in a fraught political atmosphere, which had already seen violence and would within weeks deteriorate again into a violent ethnic conflict, with the youthful Muslim protesters many turned into \"insurgents\" and labeled \"fundamentalists,\" combating the Indian police and armed forces, which did not refrain from shooting back. Since January 20, in the month preceding the demonstrations described, \"at least 82 people \\[had already\\] been killed . . . in frequent street clashes between militants and security forces in Srinagar and adjoining areas.\" Most of the victims were protesters defying the curfew imposed by the Indian government to stem the rising violence, incidents of which occurred daily. On February 10, for example, eight bombs exploded in Srinagar, the targets being two banks, a post office, shops, and businesses. A few hours earlier, a shopping complex in the city had been set on fire. Officials blamed the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front.39 Kashmir's dissident militants may be expected to continue with their mass politics combining festivals, processions, demonstrations, and violence. Since 1990 there has been a continuing violent conflict between the Indian armed forces and the Muslim dissidents. Page 244 9 Hindu Nationalism, the Ayodhya Campaign, and the Babri Masjid The Ideology of Hindu Nationalism Especially since the mid 1980s, the limelight in Indian politics has fallen on the movement called \"Hindu nationalism,\" whose clarion call is for the revitalized formation of the Hindu nation (Hindutva; Hindu Rashtra). Historically, the focal organization connected with the project of Hindu nationalism was the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), founded in Nagpur in 1925, whose mission was to regenerate the Hindu nation. Around it in succeeding years a family (parivar) of front organizations arose, namely, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, or World Hindu Council), formed in 1965 as a quasi­militant body, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, or Indian People's Party), which was constituted as a political party around 1980, its predecessor being the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Subsequently, around 1991–92, militantly nationalist offshoots such as the Bajrang Dal sprang up. The first leader of the RSS was Dr. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, whose successor in 1940 was Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, a Maharashtrian Brahman who had been a teacher at the Banaras Hindu University. The aims of the RSS were stated as follows: \"To eradicate differences among Hindus; to make them realize the greatness of their past; to inculcate in them a spirit of self­sacrifice and selfless devotion to Hindu society as a whole; to build up an organized and well­disciplined corporate life; and to bring about the regeneration of Hindu society.\" 1 The stress on the centrality of Hindu culture as the defining element of both religion and nation was given wide currency by Golwalkar in a little pamphlet, We or Our Nation Defined, first published in 1939. \"The nation,\" he said, \"is a compound of the famous five unities: geography, race, Page 245 religion, culture and language.\" 2 This formulation obviously had significant implications for the identity and status of India's immense Muslim population of nearly 110 million, and other groups such as Sikhs, Buddhists, and Christians. (The RSS claims that Sikhs and Buddhists are Hindus, which is at odds with their own sense of commitment to their distinctive religions.) Some RSS spokesmen do not choose to cite canonical authority from scripture or refer to any of the holy foundation texts of Hinduism or any defined dogma. Hinduism is not predicated on the historicity of an individual founder or on the authority of a book or canon. Hedgewar pointed to the overarching concept of dharma as forming the heart of Hinduism: on the one hand it relates to the proper \"rehabilitation of the mind\" and on the other to the \"adjustment of individuals towards a harmonious corporate existence.\" Since \"Hindu\" coincided with rashtriya, ''nationality,\" it was argued, Hindus were automatically true nationals of India. \"Members of other religions, if they denied they were Hindus, were also denying that they were Indians.\"3 After the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in January 1948, the RSS was declared an unlawful association, and Golwalkar and other leaders were arrested. The ban was later lifted. RSS volunteers, or swayamsevaks, were encouraged to think of themselves as a brotherhood dedicated to the improvement of Hindu society and eventual creation of a Hindu rashtra (nation). The movement was especially active in the Punjab and in northern India during the period of high communal tension at Partition, to which the RSS leaders have never reconciled themselves, viewing it as a profound tragedy perpetrated by Muslims. RSS ideology harps on the degradation and decline of Indian society by virtue of its disunity and the seduction of its elites by Western culture and values. There is a need, it argues, for a regeneration in order to recapture the glories of the past, and for a change in the life of contemporary Indians. After initiation in a public ceremony, youthful RSS neophytes, or shakhas (subordinate workers in local branches), experience an expanded identity as members of a collectivity devoted to the task of regeneration of Mother India—an identity larger than the parochial ones of caste and village. In general, RSS literature berates sections of the \"dehinduized intelligentsia\" influenced by Western education and culture who think that the Indian nation is a modern construct, and that Hinduism was not a definable religion, only a conglomeration of superstitious practices. Golwalkar charged the Indian National Congress with the fabrication of a new sense Page 246 of nationality on the basis of these British­hatched misconceptions. The commitment of the Indian National Congress, especially Jawaharlal Nehru, to a special definition of \"secularism\" as a solution to governing India and managing its religious diversity is rejected as concealing the reality of Indian life deeply grounded in Hindu culture. In terms of the RSS definition of the Hindu nation, four categories of people are enemies of India: Indian followers of foreign religions, such as Islam and Christianity; Communists and their sympathizers; westernized members of the Indian intelligentsia; and foreign powers. The powerful and explosive charge the RSS leaders (followed by the VHP and the BJP) made against the Congress is that after independence, Nehru and the Congress Party failed to build a new society because of their allegiance to the false dogma of secularism, which was used to win the electoral support of minorities, especially the Muslims and Christians. The success of the RSS and its allies is a reaction to a sense of personal failure or frustration experienced by many people, especially young men of the middle class, who feel that they have not shared in the benefits of the sweeping changes that have taken place in India since 1947 and that they have been marginalized by the urban elites in terms of opportunities for advancement and influence. The educated unemployed youth of India form a vast discontented and volatile constituency ready to be mobilized for populist politics of the kind promoted by the Hindu nationalists. The Ayodhya Dispute \"The Ayodhya dispute\" is shorthand for the complicated, confused controversy surrounding the sometimes violent attempts by Hindu nationalists belonging to the aforementioned groups to destroy the mosque called the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, if possible, and to build a Hindu temple devoted to the god Ram (Rama, one of the avatars of Vishnu) in its place. If this was not possible, it was felt, the next best move would be to build a temple to Ram at an adjoining site. Ayodhya, near Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh, is a sacred city for Hindus, a pilgrimage center and place of many Hindu temples. The Babri Masjid is said to have been built in 1528 by one of the Mughal Emperor Babur's generals on the site of an earlier Hindu temple dedicated to Ram, allegedly built by King Vikramaditiya in the fourth century A.D. It is popularly believed that this was the birthplace of Ram, the son of King Dasharatha of Kosala, whose capital Ayodhya was. (The use of some carved pillars in the construction of the mosque lends some credence to the claim of the preex­ Page 247 istent temple, but the pillars might have been brought from elsewhere.) Hindus call the place Ramjanmabhumi. The affair is thus labeled the Babri Masjid­ Ramjanmabhumi dispute. While the fact that the mosque was built in Babur's time is not disputed, everything about the antecedent state of affairs is. 4 In the nineteenth century, there had been some clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the Ayodhya locality. After the trauma of Partition, the Indian government closed the mosque and made it out of bounds to both Muslims and Hindus. In late December 1949, the image of the deity Ram (together with images of Lakshman, his brother, and Sita, his consort) \"appeared\" in the Babri Masjid. The Muslims considered this a defilement of their mosque, and riots ensued, which were quelled with great difficulty by police and army troops. However, in the following year, the Ramjanmabhumi Seva Committee managed to obtain permission to worship Ram's image once a year to commemorate its first appearance. In 1984, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad began its campaign to have the mosque opened for regular worship by Hindus. The Ayodhya issue, which itself served as a condensed symbol of many criticisms and grievances on the part of the Hindu nationalists against the governments in power, in particular the Congress (I) regime, became the prime electoral issue for the political party of the Hindu nationalists, the BJP, whose leader, L. K. Advani, leapt into prominence as the political challenger of successive prime ministers, notably V. P. Singh, the leader of the Janata Dal Party in 1990, and later Narasimha Rao of the Congress (I). Focusing on the Ayodhya issue enormously helped the BJP to achieve electoral success.5 From a mere two seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984, the BJP's tally rose to 85 in 1989, and two years later it had expanded to become the main opposition, with 120 seats. In 1991, the building of the Ram temple was the main issue, which like an immense umbrella encompassed many others, such as alleged favoritism toward Muslims and the corresponding plight of the Hindu majority, as instanced by the Shah Bano case (1980) and the Rajiv Gandhi government's decision to allow Muslims to follow their own \"personal laws\";6 the recommendation by the Mandal Commission of affirmative action in favor of the backward classes, which higher­caste Hindus found threatening; the violence in the Punjab and the threatened secession by the Sikhs; the violence likewise in Kashmir, exacerbating Hindu­Muslim animosities; the need for a uniform civil code for all Indian citizens; the \"pseudo­ secularism\" of the nation­state fathered by Nehru and perpetuated by Congress (I); the rejuvenation of the nation by making Hindu culture a bulwark against Western secularism, con­ Page 248 sumerism, and sexual eroticism; the continued corruption of the Congress (I) regime and the train of scandals it has spawned. All these grievances were grist for the rhetoric, propaganda, and slogans purveyed on the road to Ayodhya. This combative rhetoric came to a climax in December 1992, when the Babri mosque was demolished. The Demolition of the Babri Masjid and its Consequences On the one hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party tapped into and deployed traditional religious rituals, resources, and sentiments (avoiding narrow \"sectarian\" texts and doctrines) and also drew from the repertoire of \"public culture\"; on the other hand, it creatively used modern media for maximal propagandizing reach and modern modes of transportation for assembling its motorcades and rath yatras (\"chariot processions\") and for its \"electioneering\" in mass politics. The chariots themselves are an amalgam of the old and new: temple chariot superstructures mounted on modern trucks and vans, equipped with loudspeakers, electrical generators, and so on. They are, in fact, composite modern elaborations that also include decorative elements borrowed from Peter Brook's film of the Mahabharata, as in the case of the chariot in which Advani rode in 1990. The \"religious'' goals of \"pilgrimage\" and \"holy war\" were conflated with electoral calculations and pursuit of political power. Young recruits became voluntary \"holy workers\" (karsevaks); sadhus and sants mixed their ritual chantings with militant thuggery; and rituals of offerings called pujas and yajnas to deities were piously attended by politicians representing themselves as aspiring revivers of the Hindu nation and prospective ministers of state. \"Sacrifice for Unity\" of Mother India (Ekamata yajna) rallies and processions were staged in 1983 to create national unity. Huge images of Mother India (Bharat Mata) were carried in chariots, and holy water from the Ganges was mixed in pots (kalashas) with water from other sacred rivers and sold to temples. This campaign is alleged to have mobilized some 60 million people, and processions traversing the sacred geography of the subcontinent, from Hardwar in the north to Kanyakumari in the south, and from Gangasar in the east to Somnath in the west, from Kathmandu in the northeast to Rameswaram in the deep south, are alleged to have covered 85,000 kilometers. India, as Bharatvarsha, has long been considered a \"geographical unity\" and a global sacred field (kshetra). In 1984, the first procession to Ayodhya was staged. It was called \"a sacrifice to liberate the spot where Rama was born\" (Ram janmabhumi mukti Page 249 yajna). The objective was to \"open the lock\" (thala kholo) to the mosque and thus \"liberate Ram\" and make the deity accessible to worship. By 1989, with the temporizing of the courts, which were unwilling for good reason to adjudicate the rival Muslim and Hindu claims, passions over the Ayodhya mosque issue had mounted, and they escalated further in the face of the unstoppable violence by Sikh extremists in the Punjab and the resurgence of the Hindu­Muslim animosities in Kashmir. Sacred bricks (Ramshilas) were transported in convoys of trucks in 1989 for the mahayajna (\"great sacrifice\"), namely, the ceremony for the laying of the foundation of the temple of Ram (Ram Janmasthan Mandir). Sanctified bricks made of the \"local earth\" in multiple places were transported together with sevaks (workers) to the radial center of Ayodhya, and, in reverse, earth dug in Ayodhya was redistributed to different parts of India. This amounted to a periphery to center (centripetal) and center to periphery (centrifugal) double participatory process. In 1990, there was a procession to build the platform (Ram mandir) of the temple. The most dramatic features of this campaign was BJP President Lal Advani's 10,000 kilometer rath yatra, planned to start at the Sonmath Temple in Gujarat and conclude at the disputed Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya, and his arrest on the way. Intruding upon this sequence and adding further spin to it were the riots and immolations by students (of upper­ and middle­caste status) in many towns and cities triggered by Prime Minister V. P. Singh's decision to reactivate and implement the Mandal Commission's provisions for affirmative action in favor of the \"Other Backward Classes\" (OBC's). 7 On December 6, 1992, as mahants, pandits, and sadhus were getting ready to start the puja on the newly built platforms for the temple to Ram, the Babri Masjid was demolished by karsevaks, who broke the security cordon, scrambled on top of the domes, and smashed them, some of them plunging down with the debris (see figure 8). There was evidence of preparations for the demolition among the rank and file, and it was preceded by an immense massing at Ayodhya of leaders, activists, and workers of the Sangh Parivar, the family of organizations of the Hindutva movement. All the leaders of the movement—Advani and Vajpayee of the BJP, Joshi of the VHP, and leaders of the RSS, the Bajrang Dal, and the Shiv Sena—were present. And, unsurprisingly, incidents of arson and injury accompanied the demolition. By the end of December 8, two days after the demolition, virtually all the sevaks had left Ayodhya in buses and trains. But news of the destruction of the Babri Masjid—celebrated as the beginning of Ramraj and Page 250 Figure 8. Hindu nationalist militants storm and demolish the Babri mosque in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. Prashant Panjiar (India Today). Page 251 Bharatvarsha by Hindu militants—plunged the country into a political crisis and set off murderous Hindu­Muslim riots, further compounded by police shooting in at least six Indian states, which was responsible for most of the deaths that resulted, and by the strike (bandh) called by the BJP to protest the arrest of its party leaders. It was the worst outbreak of sectarian violence in India since the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984. After two days of fighting, more than 400 were reported killed in various parts of India, but the actual number was believed to be much higher. By this time, the arrest of the Hindu leaders, the banning of five Hindu and Muslim organizations, and the one­day general strike called by the BJP had added considerably to the intense tensions and violence. Among the Indian cities, the worst incidents of violence took place in Bombay, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Varanasi, and Jaipur. In Pakistan, Karachi and Lahore were much inflamed, as was Dhaka in Bangladesh. Incidents of arson involving Muslims and Hindus, Indians and Pakistanis, took place as far away as the United Kingdom. By December 11, UPI News reported, \"Authorities said Friday that violence was diminishing after five days of vicious communal clashes that killed 1,050 people and injured more.\" The BBC also reported a return to normalcy on the same day, with a death toll of \"over 900 so far.\" The number of deaths throughout India frequently reported as the final count in numerous press reports was 1,200. In virtually no case did the riots last longer than six or seven days (from the evening of December 6 to December 11 or 12), once again showing that civilian riots are generally short­lived and unstable, and that once past their peak, in about three days, they simmer down as the army and other security forces begin to exert their authority and take effective preventive action. The Bombay Riots One notable departure from this pattern is the flow of events in the city of Bombay, where there were two spells of rioting, the first, as in other places, from December 6 to December 12, 1992, and then, after an interval of a month, with only minor incidents, a second outbreak of even greater intensity from January 7 to January 16, 1993. On the face of it, Bombay was an unlikely site for the violence: it is a bustling center of finance and commerce and considered one of Asia's most cosmopolitan cities. It is also said to be India's most populous city. At the census of 1991, the population of greater Bombay was 9.9 million, and its Page 252 density was an extraordinary 16,432 persons per square mile. The metropolitan agglomeration was estimated as 12.6 million in 1991, making Bombay the sixth most populated city in the world. 8 But Bombay is also a city of startling economic disparities and mounting tensions. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, there was a large decline in the kinds of employment that fed and clothed numerous manual, semi­skilled, and skilled workers. Nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, and textiles made way for chemicals as the city's major employer. Declining employment prospects were further compounded by deteriorating labor­management relations and large streams of migrants from other parts of India, adding to the variety of religious and linguistic communities living in close proximity. This could lead to explosive zero­sum contests between the local Maharashtrian \"sons of the soil\" (bhumiputra) and migrants, as exemplified by the attack of Shiv Sena militants on South Indian migrant labor in the late 1960s. Bombay has its affluent residential enclaves and plush hotels and shopping centers, needless to say, but \"more than half its population lives in slums in most miserable conditions. These slums have mixed populations of various religious and regional as well as caste communities. These are usually a maze of narrow lanes and bylanes, making it easy for the miscreants to hide themselves and difficult for the law­enforcing agencies to pursue them.\"9 \"Taken together, the communal violence of December and January \\[1993\\] spread to every part of the metropolis. . . . In the first phase, south­central Bombay was the first and worst affected area. Rioting then spread to some suburbs. . . . In the second phase, the riots spread over almost all of greater Bombay, that is, downtown and central Bombay, as well as the western and eastern suburbs, to Dahisar in the west and Mulund and Deonar in the east.\"10 In the first phase, in December, fifteen police station areas were under curfew; in the second, the number increased to twenty­four. As noted earlier, exact casualty figures—the numbers of those killed, injured, displaced, or expelled—and details of damage to and looting of property, and so on, are notoriously difficult to compile in riot situations. In Bombay, widely diverging figures were cited by the police and army, by hospitals and morgues, by relief workers, by journalists and unofficial investigating teams, and by the local residents on both sides of the divide. Whatever the wide variations in figures—the government's official sources always depressing them and the victimized neighborhoods exaggerating them—it is clear that the Bombay toll was very large. Page 253 According to the figures compiled by the Times of India, 227 people died in the December riots, and 557 in the January riots; another 317 succumbed in March bombings related to the riots, allegedly the work of Muslim terrorists linked with the Gulf states (which unfortunately cannot be gone into here). 11 Somewhat higher estimates are given by Asghar Ali Engineer: \"In the first phase, the Government admitted more than 200 deaths, but the number is more than 300.\" For the second phase, while the official figures put the toll at 650, Engineer surmises that \"the figure may exceed 1000.\"12 The Times of India calculated that 10,000 houses, from 70 to 300 bakeries, over 70 percent of Bombay's timber warehouses, and about 500 trucks and 150 taxis were set on fire and damaged or destroyed. Some fifty thousand people were rendered homeless. Property damage was estimated at 40 billion rupees,13 not counting damage to the public transport system (railways and buses) and electricity supply, or loss of manufacturing output, services, and trading and working days, which can only be very roughly quantified. Although, especially in the second phase around January 10, middle­ and upper­class residential areas such as parts of Malabar Hill, Warden Road, and Central Dalal Estate were attacked, by far the worst cases of arson, homicide, and displacement of people occurred in Bombay's sprawling working­class and poverty­stricken slums. In the first phase, the most frequently mentioned locality was Dharavi, others being Govandi, Mahim, Bhendi Bazar, and Null Bazar; in the second phase, localities such as Dongri, Nagpada, Pydhonie, and Tardeo figure in the reports. The terms slum and shanty settlement give the impression that these are merely dense concentrations of the very poor, but the areas mentioned include markets and bazaars, temples and mosques and saints' tombs, timber godowns, groceries, and artisans' shops. These so­called slums are where the majority of the urban population—shopkeepers, workers, artisans and craftsmen, transport workers, taxi drivers, \"coolies,\" construction workers, and so on—live, but wedged inside them are also lower­middle­class and white­collar communities of brick­built pakka (proper) houses. The areas in question were populated by different proportional mixes of Muslims and Hindus (themselves differentiated by region of origin, primary language, and sectarian affiliation). Some were predominantly Hindu or Muslim; others were characterized by co­residence and contiguity of the two groups. Although on various occasions, the Muslims (who Page 254 made up 15 percent of Bombay's population) were the attackers or engaged in exchanges of violence, by far the largest number of victims were Muslims, most of them passive targets. Perhaps to a degree unknown in the case studies previously outlined, the Bombay riots present us with the worst instances of active police participation in the shooting of victims. While in the rioting areas of Bombay, the police in some measure were taxed and had to act in self­defense, many reports charge the police with indiscriminate shooting, the larger number of their victims being Muslims. The vast majority of the police force in all ranks were non­Muslim, and, as I have argued before, a police force so constituted is bound to share the political values of the majority. When the rioting was over, the death count over the first week was reported as 259. Engineer estimates that in all over 400 Muslims were killed or injured. 14 \"What started off as a clash between Muslim youths and armed police trying to protect public property turned communal as the riots spread from the densely­ populated Muslim areas of south and central Bombay to the huge slums of Dharavi, Deonar and Ghatkopar,\" India Today noted.15 It was also accepted, and conceded by Police Commissioner Bapat, that the vast majority of deaths in Bombay were caused by police firing, and that Muslim crowds were the primary victims of this police action. Toward the end of the first phase of the upheaval, in the face of police complicity and mostly unilateral involvement, the home minister of Maharashtra State called for the deployment of thousands of Indian Army troops to head off further rioting. The deliberate, calculated use of violence by the Shiv Sena movement as a mode of conducting politics, and to gain economic advantage and greater power for its leaders and their lieutenants, is a noteworthy aspect of the Bombay riots. The phrase \"criminalization of politics,\" commonly used in India today, aptly applies to the activities of this organization. Virtually all reports on the Bombay riots unfailingly point to the Shiv Sena, led by Bal Thackeray, as taking the lead in organizing and planning violence against Muslims in what has been described as a pogrom. Thackeray's movement has been explicitly compared to Hitler's Nazis and its activities to present­day \"ethnic cleansing\" in Bosnia. Founded in 1966 for the express purpose of conducting a campaign to reserve jobs for \"sons of the soil,\" the Shiv Sena grew subsequently into a more organized and multifunctional mafia­style operation. At one stage in the mid 1980s, it captured power in, and virtually ran, the Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC), and it still has its elected members in the BMC. Aside from Thackeray, the next most conspicuous figure is Madhukar Sar­ Page 255 potdar, a member of the Maharashtra State Legislative Assembly and an active figure in local politics and protection rackets. The Shiv Sena runs its own newspapers and has links with others, which support it; it controls certain labor unions, which function as right­wing enforcers against left­oriented unions; and it has ties to some of Maharashtra's barons of industry, who finance it. By the early 1990s, the Shiv Sena's leaders found it advantageous to renew their political presence by supporting the cause of Hindu nationalism and became like the VHP, a militant body, participating in the rath yatras and espousing the BJP's political rhetoric. During the Bombay riots, especially in the days before and during the second phase in January 1993, it successfully staged maha­aratis, rituals of collective worship, at various Hindu temples in Bombay, in order to mobilize crowds for launching of violent actions. Devised to contest and rival the traditional Muslim Friday afternoon prayers (namaaz) at mosques, where large numbers of Muslims met and heard their preachers, the Shiv Sena used the maha­aratis to convene Hindu worshipers and urge them to put an end to the \"appeasement\" policies of the government toward Muslims by attacking and displacing the local Muslims. The nexus between Bombay's politicians, businessmen, police, and the Shiv Sena deserves deeper study, for it would also show how the city's politics is linked to the state's, and the state's to national politics. During the riots, one of the tangles that exacerbated the difficulties of slowing down the violence were the alleged rivalries and animosities between Naik, Bombay's chief minister, and Sharad Pawar, a fellow Maharashtrian, who had gone to Delhi as defence minister but later returned to Bombay, on the orders of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, to replace Naik. These rival politicians were themselves patrons of, and associated with, allegedly criminal gangs. The impact of the riots and the displacement of Muslims on the spatial and occupational distribution of population in metropolitan Bombay is also noteworthy. The spatial factor relates to the control of land as real estate in a city where land—including land occupied by slum dwellers—is expensive and has much more profitable alternate uses. The Shiv Sena's direction of attacks on Muslims, and their dispossession and displacement, and counteractions by Muslim gangs on a lesser scale were thus to a significant degree also concerned with the conquest of space. Concurrently, the displacement of Muslims in specialized crafts and artisanal work (weaving, leather working) affected the division of labor in the city and deprived it of essential services. The increased polarization of the Hindu and Muslim communities and the partial rearrangement by \"ethnic cleansing\" of Bombay's Page 256 residential areas and business sites, and of its ethnic composition in employment, are serious consequences of the pogrom conducted against the Muslims of Bombay, both poor and rich, slum dwellers and occupants of middle­class or affluent apartments. The expulsion of occupants of shanties—even in the slums of Dharavi and Behrampada, their tiny spaces are valuable and salable—or pushing Muslims and Hindus into homogeneous enclaves, when previously they lived jumbled together at various sites and in interstitial areas, the invasion of the residences of upper­middle­class Muslims, and the looting of their property or complete takeover of their apartments—these actions, if not reversed, would lead to \"a geographical reorganization of a complex and historic city along communal lines.\" 16 The war against one another to capture real estate was engaged in by a number of interest groups—whether they be businessmen looking to redevelop, traders displacing rivals, the poor looking for tenement space, Shiv Sena youth gangs looting and burning, or other ad hoc gangs of both Hindus and Muslims on the rampage. Their acts had little to do, as the riots developed and continued, with the original \"grand\" cause of protecting the Babri mosque or of liberating Ram—that is, with the alleged great national communal divide between Hindus and Muslims. Such collective ethnonational charters become secondary to the pursuit of personal political and property concerns. At their worst moments, irrespective of whether they were Hindu or Muslim, the rioters may have been battening on and cannibalizing their own kind. Equally significant, the \"ethnic cleansing\" furthermore had much to do in the context of high unemployment with displacing \"outsiders\" from the jobs they held and the occupations they followed. In 1966 and subsequently, the Shiv Sena was out to eject South Indian Tamils from jobs that Maharashtrians envied. The Bombay riots of 1992–93 resulted in the flight of many Muslim families, especially those of small business, craft, artisan, and other working­class status, and it is unclear how many of them will return, and, even if they return, whether they will be able or permitted to resume their former occupations. Although the worst of the violence had passed by February 1993, the signs of hatred continued. It was reported that labor unions run by Shiv Sena were intimidating Muslim workers, preventing them from returning to their jobs in some of the city's largest industries, including Otis Elevator, the Mahindra jeep and tractor plants, and companies on the docks. There were also reports of warnings issued to Hindus not to patronize or work for establishments run by \"antinational\" Muslim employers. Page 257 The Processes of Nationalization and Parochialization Earlier chapters introduced and illustrated a pair of interrelated processes, namely, focalization and transvaluation, which were perceived in the unfolding and trajectory of the 1915 Sinhalese­Muslim riots in Sri Lanka and the Karachi riots between Pathans and Muhajirs in 1985. These two concepts were coined to label the manner in which microevents at the local level, through chainlike linkages, accelerate and cumulatively build up into an avalanche, whose episodes progressively lose their local contextual, circumstantial, and substantive associations, while the violence, lasting a few days, is retrospectively generalized and made into a macroevent or master narrative labeled an \"ethnic conflict\" between two antagonistic ethnic groups. Now is the time to introduce another pair of concepts, nationalization and parochialization, to describe and sum up processes of unfolding that are the very opposite in sequence and significance to those pertaining to focalization and transvaluation. The RSS, BJP, and VHP, which aspire to power at the union center and in state governments, claim to be movements sponsoring causes with national significance, exemplified by the very concept of Hindutva. The building of a new temple to Ram in Ayodhya was portrayed as an all­India Hindu nationalist cause. For these movements, Ayodhya was an axis mundi and a locus classicus, a condensed symbol signifying the whole. Processions carrying sacred bricks, unity campaigns, and rath yatras started from various dispersed peripheral points and radiated toward the center, the birthplace of Ram. Correspondingly, earth dug at the center and sacred water from the Ganges were distributed in centrifugal fashion to various parts of the subcontinent. Radiating out from India's metropolitan centers to its peripheries, this phenomenon in due course affected hundred of towns and villages, engaging with local power structures, local complexes of castes, sects, and ethnic groups, and playing itself out in relation to these particular cleavages, which adapted and concretized the national cause to suit their local political contexts and contingencies. This reproduction of a national issue in diverse local places, where it explodes like a cluster bomb in multiple context­bound ways, I call parochialization. Nationalization and parochialization thus relate to each other as a top­down, center­to­periphery process, while focalization and transvaluation involve a bottom­up, periphery­to­center aggregating and generalizing process. The Bombay riots are a prime example Page 258 of how a ''national\" cause and a \"national\" event worked themselves out in terms of local causes, networks, and interests, and thus became parochialized. The two contrasted sets of processes, focalization and transvaluation, and nationalization and parochialization, thus together provide us with a way of describing and interpreting current ethnonationalist conflicts and their paths of collective violence. Violence in Democratic Politics The rath yatras, juggernauts, and other processions associated with the Ayodhya dispute and enacted as a religiocultural cause dedicated to religious devotionalism and Hindu revival were also simultaneously political theater, carrying and employing a number of institutionalized and organized components, which constitute a repertoire of collective violence deployed in elections and the conduct of democratic politics. These components are part of that repertoire: 1. Motorized cavalcades, consisting of hundreds of cars and vans snaking through towns, stopping for roadside rallies and explosive speeches, sparking violent incidents, even riots. 2. The call for national strikes (hartal), usually lasting one day, that result in the stoppage of transport services and the closing of bazaars and shops. 3. Collisions between matchers and police, troops, and paramilitary forces, resulting in some deaths and injury to the people in the crowds, both protesters and onlookers, and to members of the security forces. 4. When collisions develop into \"riots,\" standard actions are arson and destruction of vehicles (cars, jeeps, buses) and buildings, especially if these are \"government property.\" 5. Timing rath yatras to take place at the time of festivals such as Dassehra, in October, when Ram and Ravana are alive and well in dramatic performance of the Ramayana, 17 and pilgrimage climaxes such as circumambulations which not only ensure the spectator­presence of hordes of pilgrims and celebrating civilians but also lend to the processions, which embody a large potential for violent acts, the atmosphere of permitted license, euphoria, and effervescence associated with \"holi\" days and carnivals. Moreover, politically motivated \"self­immolations\" and \"homicides\" are staged as \"religious acts\" and the slogans of past \"holy wars\" and \"historical battles\" serve as challenges and triggers to violence in the current holy war. Page 259 These acts and events form a repertoire of collective violence linking up with and drawing from the collective calendrical festivities and celebrations of public culture, and insofar as that repertoire is systematized through repeated performance over a period of time, it foregrounds violence itself as a mode of conducting politics and begins to shade into civil war, when violent conflict becomes an everyday state of affairs. The Indian media have been effectively harnessed and deployed in various ways to propagandize causes such as the Ayodhya temple issue, notwithstanding that India is a country in which 65 percent of the population are illiterate (and only 2 percent know English). Lloyd Rudolph has recently perceptively commented that \"the increasing prominence of the media has accelerated a trend away from locally based, bottom up politics, a trend that was already well launched before the 1989 elections.\" There is, Rudolph asserts, a shift in Indian politics from party based campaigns, relying on local workers who approximate ward organization, toward plebiscitary campaigning organized around simple slogans and whirlwind visits by great personalities. Since 1971, when the link between national parliamentary and state elections was broken, electoral waves (6 to 9 percent shifts in party vote shares) whipped up by nationally resonant slogans such as \"abolish poverty,\" \"restore democracy,\" or \"preserve national unity\" have come to settle parliamentary elections. Then came audio cassettes featuring candidates' and leaders' voice messages and party songs, followed by the spread of national television, radio and VCRs. The collaboration of television, radio and VCRs has clearly accelerated the shift from party­based campaigning to the plebiscitary mode.\" 18 This observation catches much of the tenor and tempo of contemporary Indian electoral politics. One may, however, wish to modify somewhat Rudolph's illuminating top­down globalizing plebiscitarian perspective by reminding ourselves that the \"national\" and \"nationalizing\" issues also have their distinctive \"parochial\" unfoldings and denouements, which are sensitive to local fault lines, local alignments and factions. Moreover, there are also bottom­up instances, where a chain of local events escalates and spreads, and, undergoing the processes of \"focalization\" and \"transvaluation,'' cumulatively becomes more generalized and simplified, concluding as a binary global divide such as those between Muslims and Hindus, Sinhala Buddhists and Hindu Tamils, Pathans and Muhajirs, and so on. But here too local media have played their communicational roles. All things considered, this observation seems valid: mass politics and mass religious fervor in many places—ranging from Iran to India to Ar­ Page 260 menia—now make efficacious and explosive use of communication media and high­tech devices. Aside from radio and films, followed by television, perhaps the most sensational recent development is the use of VCRs and audiocassettes, by means of which both villagers in remote rural areas and the unlettered in cramped urban slums can hear messages and see visual images propagated by leaders and ideologues from metropolitan centers. Moreover, the further import of these new cassette media, widely available and cheap to acquire and distribute, is that they can serve as a counter­weight to, and a subverter of, governments, which have been hitherto monopolized television and radio broadcasting, censored newspapers, and been the primary sources and purveyors of information. The causes of ethnonationalities and minorities fighting the centralized powers of states and authoritarian regimes are advanced through this revolution in information transmission. Moreover, rumors, which are notorious for instigating and fueling violence by interweaving rage with panic and fear of the \"enemy,\" circulate all the more speedily through the media. The Weiner Paradox \"How does one explain why India's democratic institutional structure persists, and how does one explain the paradox of a democratic system continuing to function in the midst of sharp social cleavages and large scale violence?\" Myron Weiner asks. India's democratic system continues to flourish, says Weiner, although \"conflicts among religions, castes and tribal communities have shown no signs of abating,\" and although the record of democracy is not an unblemished one, as illustrated by the period of emergency from 1975–77. 19 The same question with some modification and greater skepticism can be asked about Sri Lanka. Indian democracy is widely celebrated for good reasons. But my answer to the Indian puzzle is that participatory democracy, competitive elections, mass militancy, and crowd violence are not disconnected. They were not disconnected in Europe: in Britain, for instance, the latter part of the nineteenth century saw the parallel rise of democracy and industrial militancy, through the two suffrage acts and the emergence of the \"new unionism.\" And before that the French Revolution had ushered in the crowd as an enduring political force, with the storming of the Bastille as the stereotypical image of crowd politics. Thereafter, the political doctrines of democracy had to speak directly of the people, for or against it, and governments had to shape techniques to control the militant crowd as a manifestation of peo­ Page 261 ple's power, just as intellectuals had to accommodate it as a central concern in their social and political theories. It seems that theorists of South Asian politics should make room today for militant electoral politics and collective violence as an integral component of their theories of democracy at work. The ideal normative description of democracy is that of a rational system of representative government where citizens as individuals—with \"one man, one vote\"—make rational choices according, to their interests and values, about which parties to support and which candidates to elect. And this theory also holds that the governed hold their governors to account through periodic elections and by recourse to judicial process. But democracy in South Asia is also a manner of conducting mass politics. The mobilization of the crowds and the wooing of their support—through election speeches, rallies, mass media propaganda, and dispensation of favors through election machines—is the central process of persuasion and vote­getting. This reliance on crowds and mass mobilization opens the door to the invention and propagation of collective slogans and collective ideologies, to the appeal to collective entitlements for groups in terms of divisive \"substance codes\" of blood and soil (to borrow a term from McKim Marriott). 20 Today \"ethnicity\" is the most potent energizer, embodying and radiating religious, linguistic, territorial, and class and caste identities and interests; it is also the umbrella under which personal, familial, commercial, and other local scores are settled. In the practice of democracy in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, the Weiner paradox is facilitated by presenting public policies through state­controlled media as though they were the outcome of rational debate, and by making public ritual and spectacles parade as the process of consultation of the masses and seeking their legitimacy and consent. There are other processes in the practice of democracy that are also related to the generation of collective communal violence. An increasing number of commentators, both Indian and Western, are drawing our attention to the dangers of the Indian state becoming a relatively independent and dominant actor, with its own interests that dictate specific policies in relation to ethnic and cultural groups in the polity. Engaged in its unrealistic project of creating a homogenized nation­state, it frustrates the cultural and social pluralism of India.21 In addition, the nation­state project articulates two other, antithetical social aims. The alleged push toward equality and the goal of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number open the way to the proliferation of Page 262 bureaucratic and hierarchical administrative structures, in which officials of various sorts make citizens subject themselves to obvious forms of obeisance, subordination, inequality, and extortion. To adapt and echo an argument made by Ralf Dahrendorf, the sensitive points of contest and conflict in modern societies, including third world countries, with their bureaucratic expansion, lies in the differential distribution of power among officials and citizens, and the dominance of the former over the latter in daily encounters. It should therefore come as no surprise when protesting crowds attack and destroy government buildings and public property and immobilize public services and utilities, the very social capital and the infrastructure allegedly instituted to serve them. It is a form of political Luddism. Coda: Elections and Collective Violence Ethnonationalist conflicts and collective violence are obviously nothing new. They have occurred at other times in many places. In third world countries, \"democratic\" political elections are, however, a major contributor to collective violence. Moreover, because the stakes in the election process and its outcome seem so high in these societies, and because elections permit and indeed encourage calculated expressions and enactments of polarizing hostility, such outbreaks may well overshadow earlier cases of routinized periodic violence. The general theme of whether democracy as a political process and the democratic state as a system intensify the occurrence of violence is an old one in the history of political theory. From the Greeks onwards, even up to the nineteenth century, many theorists, perhaps most, associated democracy with civil strife, and it is only subsequently that this became a minority view. Gustave Le Bon's characterization of the crowd as violent and irrational was linked to his antipathy to the French Revolution and subsequent democratic development in France. It is apposite here to mention the concerns and remedies voiced in The Federalist, composed by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay at the time of the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1787–88. 22 The authors used the term republics, by which they meant political systems that derived their legitimacy from the electoral process. A central argument against republics in the Federalist papers was that they have short lives, because they exhaust themselves in bouts of internal violence. This happens because the \"principle of liberty\" that they must endorse allows the open expression of hostility, and once such expressions are permitted, it becomes virtually impossible to check or defuse them. Page 263 Madison seems to have taken it as axiomatic that contentious motivations propelled human beings. In Number 10 of The Federalist, he asserted: The latent causes of factions are. . . sown in the nature of man. . . . A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre­eminence and power; or to persons of other description whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to cooperate for the common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities. . . . the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. 23 My concern here is not to take a position on the essential contentiousness or goodness of human beings, but to take note that, concerned with \"that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties,\" the framers of the Constitution fashioned \"controls on government\" that would check the \"destructive passions\" of democracy. In defending the separation of powers in the new government, Madison cited these words of Thomas Jefferson's: ''An elective despotism was not the government we fought for; but one which should not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits, without being effectually checked and restrained by the others.\"24 South Asia exemplifies the widespread propensity to collective violence in the conduct of politics in the circumstances of our modern times. Majoritarian domination of minorities leads to elective despotism (the so­called \"tyranny of majority rule\"). Communal or ethnic collectivities, based on race, territory, religion, or language—or a combination of these—and committed to the cry of collective entitlements, result in exclusivist claims and in separatist remedies, thereby making negotiated settlements difficult. And overly centralized governments that are insensitive to the concerns of pluralities, balk at devolution of powers, and resist the idea of pluralism as the necessary coexistence and tolerance of diversity are in danger of being controlled by political and bureaucratic \"elites\" and sections of the army, or of being hijacked by a fundamentalist majority. If competitive democratic politics, ethnic conflicts, and collective violence are linked in the postcolonial, postindependence politics of South Asia, it may be asked, are there defensible alternatives to democratic forms of government? Having become committed to democracy, it would now be Page 264 ideologically impossible for these countries to entertain and justify any form of unelected authoritarianism, although in practice distortions toward it have occurred and will continue to occur. If collective violence is an actual as well as potential destabilizing force in South Asia, we may be led to ask whether certain kinds of collective identity issues can be or may have to be regulated or taken out of the political arena. Ethnonationalist politics in its various forms continually escalates into disputes over community boundaries, exclusions and inclusions of persons, and separate but not equal group claims. These issues eventually deteriorate into riots, civil wars, pogroms of \"ethnic cleansing,\" and secessions. (Some theorists would hold that social class politics are so different from ethnic contests because they are usually concerned with the distribution of power and resources within a society, without raising the question of community or collectivity boundaries and the explosive threat of secession.) With regard to the issue of the top­heavy character of postcolonial governments and their failure to achieve political integration with and at all levels of society, James Manor has made observations about Sri Lanka that may have wider applicability. Among other things, Manor connects the regular swings and alternations of power between two parties and their coalition allies to weak political integration between the elite and the masses, the lack of intermediary organizations linking them, and the inability to settle ethnic conflict because politicians resist devolution of power to \"local government\" and regional constituencies. Elections, Manor points out, produce ecstatic hopes, soaring, unrealistic expectations, and postelection disappointments. The intoxication with politics and the air of unreality and unspecificity that swirls around it lead to heady elections and social turbulence. 25 There are other matters diagnostic of an insufficiently grounded unitary nation­state. The crisis of the nation­state in South Asia (and many other places) is dialectically linked with the surge of ethnonationalism. In India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, the attempt to realize the nation­state on a Western European model has virtually failed. The nation­state conception has not taken deep roots in South Asia or generated a widespread and robust participatory \"public culture\" that celebrates it in widely meaningful ceremonies, festivals, and rituals. The \"independence day\" parades and speeches, the opening of Parliament, the weak affirmations of the secular state in the face of sectarian claims to special treatment, and other markers of nation­state existence pale in public support and relevance when compared to the scale and intensity of calendrical religious and eth­ Page 265 nic festivals. The rituals and affirmations surrounding the monarchy as embodying national unity in Britain and the celebrations of \"civil religion\" focused on nation­ making events in the United States have no real parallels in the new nation­states of South Asia. The truly engaging foci of a public culture are to be found in the arenas and festivities linked to features of communal life, associated with literature, recitations, texts, sagas, mythologies, and popular theater, which celebrate and enact religiopolitical and social memories and concerns of collectivities in place for a long time. This is why, for instance, the divisive themes but effective presentations of Hindu nationalism, Sikh nationalism, Sinhala Buddhist nationalism, and Dravidian nationalism so greatly constitute and dominate mass politics and participation in elections. Page 266 10 Entering a Dark Continent The Political Psychology of Crowds So far we have investigated these sociological features of rioting crowds: the identity of the faces in the crowd (their social position, occupational status, sex); the extent to which the riots were organized (in the sense that there were leaders and agents provocateurs who mobilized crowds, fed them with information regarding the designated targets, armed them, provided vehicles); the sites and locations where the riots took place and the nature of the arson, looting, and killing; and, finally, the overall trajectories, phases, and duration of riots. From the examination of these particularities, we then moved on to the interpretive tasks of locating certain patterns and processes. The concepts of focalization and transvaluation were introduced to describe the trajectory of riots, especially the way in which riots as particular incidents and local conflicts build up into a massive avalanche labeled \"ethnic riots.\" The complementary concepts of nationalization and parochialization were coined to describe the processes in the opposite direction when nationally mounted issues at focal centers have their dispersed and fragmented manifestation in local places in terms of local cleavages. Patterns of routinization and ritualization of collective violence were established, and the stereotyped strategies and acts that syntactically and recursively constitute collective events such as riots, elections, festivals, and so on were identified. All this should be borne in mind as contributing to our understanding of crowd formation and crowd behavior as we move on to still another analytical and interpretive level, which concerns the processes by which individual participants merging into crowd formations experience and manifest certain heightened psychic states and convulsive behavioral impulsions. This exercise ideally calls for the matching and intertwining of communicational and interactional processes with psychic and experien­ Page 267 tial processes at both the personal and interpersonal levels when crowds form and move as collectivities. Unfortunately, the issue of dialectically linking these processes and their feedback at the individual and interpersonal levels has so far produced little systematic theorizing. In fact, the territory of \"crowd psychology,\" a label modern psychologists have eschewed in favor of \"political psychology,\" despite well­known writing on the subject by Gustave Le Bon, Gabriel de Tarde, Sigmund Freud, Elias Canetti, George Rudé, and others, remains one of the least mapped in the social sciences. Some writers are attracted by the idea of archetypal fixations and expressions embedded in the collective unconscious that become manifest in crowds. Others are sympathetic to arguments in favor of processes of suggestibility, imitation, homogenization, weakened intellectual reasoning, and heightened emotional states that occur when people become massed as crowds. Still others have linked crowds to their central fixation on, and identification with, charismatic leadership, and seek in turn to link this propensity to relationships and experiences in the family between parents and children. And a few neanderthal theorists have even indulged in fanciful imaginings about the primordial human horde and its herd \"instincts\" and propensities, its bonding as a group, and its territorial and/or mating imperatives. Given these interpretive possibilities, which in our present state of knowledge we obviously cannot accept as systematic truths, I have decided to present my thoughts and evidence in this chapter in the form of a \"post­modern\" discourse: episodic, even disconnected sometimes, suggestive, multivalent, and polyphonic. It is generally regarded that, although he had predecessors in Thomas Carlyle, Hippolyte Taine, Jules Michelet, Gabriel de Tarde, and others, all retrospectively making judgments about the role of the crowds in the French Revolution, it was Gustave Le Bon's Psychologie des foules, published in 1895 and translated soon afterward as The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, that initiated \"crowd psychology\" and the \"crowd mind\" as a subject of explicit formal study and intellectual theorizing. Le Bon's text, which I shall treat in detail later, had its special emphases and limitations. His \"crowd,\" covering many phenomena, was discussed in the abstract as a single entity. An admirer neither of the French Revolution nor of the trends toward popular democracy in the nineteenth century, the conservative Le Bon reduced the crowd to its lowest common denominator of intellectual weakening and irrational impulses, destructiveness, and imitative suggestibility. He finally attached the crowd to the phenomenon of the leader, a theme that Freud was to acknowledge and develop as his central Page 268 theoretical issue in his Massenpsychologie und Ich­Analyse, translated as Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1926). Freud's discussions may be pertinent for the study of charismatic leaders spearheading revolutionary movements, such as Moses, Napoleon, Lenin, Hitler, Mussolini, Gandhi, and Khomeini. 1 Le Bon's and Freud's theses have been extended and magnified by Serge Moscovici, who apocalyptically identifies the twentieth century as the epoch of mass psychology. This dramatic claim stems from Moscovici's retrospective viewing of the mass characteristics of the Nazi and Fascist movements, whose leaders generated the euphoria that carried their publics enthusiastically into the imperial objectives of World War II, and imposed their genocidal policies on designated enemies, especially the Jews.2 But the ethnic riots and communal violence I am discussing are not sustained, large­scale movements led by charismatic leaders, whose dialectical relation to the crowd is seen by certain theorists as the central issue for explication. They are volatile formations that periodically erupt and are organized, if at all, by transitory and subnational leaders and by lower echelons of collaborators commanding parochial networks and acting according to political circumstance and context. They are not led by the Nehrus, the Bhuttos, or the Bandaranaikes, and their structure and dynamics are better approached in ways I have illustrated earlier. Le Bon's Heterogeneous Crowds Le Bon, who is of central relevance for us, even as a foil, and as an aid to clarification, phrased the problem of the \"mental unity\" of crowds in terms that are in some respects still valid for us today as setting one interpretive task: From the psychological point of view the expression \"crowd\" assumes . . . \\[this\\] signification. Under certain circumstances, and only under those circumstances, an agglomeration of men presents new characteristics very different from those of the individuals composing it. The sentiments and ideas of all persons in the gathering take one and the same direction, and their conscious personality vanishes. A collective mind is formed, doubtless transitory, but presenting very clearly defined characteristics.3 Le Bon classified crowds into two types, heterogeneous and homogeneous. Heterogeneous crowds are composed of \"dissimilar\" elements—that is, of individuals \"of any description, of any profession, and any degree of intelligence.\"4 They are \"anonymous\" crowds, best exemplified by street crowds. It is these heterogeneous, anonymous, and temporary crowds that form the primary subject matter of Le Bon's Psychologie des foules. Le Bon Page 269 defined homogeneous crowds, which he excluded from his study, as formed of \"elements more or less akin,\" exemplified by groups such as sects (political, religious sects), castes (military, priestly, or occupational), and classes (middle classes, peasant classes). Insofar as Le Bon applied this label to groups acting as special­interest associations and pursuing their objectives over a period of time, we can see the point of his dichotomy. Thus the issue for elucidation posed by heterogeneous crowds is as follows: \"Whoever be the individuals that compose it, however like or unlike be their mode of life, their occupations, their character, their intelligence, the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd puts them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would feel, think, and act were he in a state of isolation.\" 5 Although I myself would today avoid some of the words in this passage, Le Bon's problematic is not irrelevant, indeed, it must be faced, especially since the crowds he was concerned with are not unlike the civilian crowds I have described as taking part in the ethnonationalist conflicts of South Asia: crowds composed of cross sections of urban populations, especially of the middle and lower orders, and that as short­lived collectivities engage in volatile and violent actions that they would ordinarily avoid as individuals. But with respect to South Asian riot mobs, there is a serious shortcoming to the way in which Le Bon set up his problem. In the organization and direction of the ethnic riots and communal violence I am dealing with, one quite frequently sees the hands of professional politicians and their parties or factions, of business or trading groups distinguished by caste or language, of agents provocateurs and their gangs, while the crowds so mobilized or called into action by them may well become the heterogeneous, anonymous, and temporary formations that Le Bon focused on. This qualification is not unimportant. For where I shall deviate from, and, I hope, improve upon, Le Bon (and Canetti) is by insisting on the circumstances in which the politicization of ethnicity and communalism has occurred in contemporary plural societies, and on the claims to group entitlements that in current mass politics provide the initial basis for collective identity, mobilization, and action. There is, therefore, a certain politico­economic purposiveness and directedness in the actions of crowds to some degree backed and orchestrated by interest groups. What I label \"leveling\" tendencies are pegged to the larger historical contexts and considerations of political economy, and the distribution of power within the society in question, which must be aligned with and dialectically related to other manifestations of \"leveling,\" the homogenization, suggestibility, and eu­ Page 270 phoria that Le Bon isolates as the key issues of crowd psychology. Moreover, the two interwoven strands of leveling must also be keyed to interpersonal communicational processes, including especially the role of rumors, which operate throughout the period of violence. The role of the media in transmitting information and misinformation, and in the heightening of aggressive sentiments, cannot be emphasized enough. The comments of witnesses to the Delhi riots of 1984 clearly pose in graphic language the multiple, even paradoxical, facets of mob violence that Le Bon's simplified notion of \"heterogeneous\" crowds misses: See the mob is a mob. Woh kuch nahin sunta. \\[They don't listen to anything.\\] The mob is blind. It listens to no one. But all this could happen only if the mob had some backing or the promise of some reward. There was absolutely no sign of fear in the mob's actions. When we asked them, \"Aren't you afraid of the army, aren't you afraid of the police?\" they said they had nothing to fear. 6 This comment by a middle­class housewife who witnessed the brutalities inflicted by crowds on the Sikhs in a train at the Tughlakabad railway station, on the line from Bombay to Delhi, contains many themes and many interpretive possibilities. The mob's intensified \"blind\" passions explain its conduct—but the mob is at the same time possibly backed by organized interests, both political and economic, and it has a stake in the rewards of looting and leveling, which imply that the mob's actions are to some degree purposive, directed, and legitimated in advance. Moreover, the mob is not afraid of the army or the police, either because it feels omnipotent as a mob, because it knows that the security forces are in sympathy with it and will not interfere (at least in the early phase of the riots), or because both these attitudes are co­ present. I find Elias Canetti a more congenial interpreter of crowds than Le Bon. In Crowds and Power (1978), Canetti speaks, not of the crowd in the abstract, but of different types of crowds, which are capable of enabling as well as destructive actions, and the bases and impulsions of which can be dealt with apart from the apical leader as a necessary component. Canetti is not hobbled by a revolutionary and reactionary obsession about a crowd's perennial regression to irrational violence, and, although he himself does not situate his typologies in thick descriptions of politico­economic contexts, he is open to the possibility that both archetypal and circumstantial features may be deciphered from their actions.7 Before engaging with Canetti's vivid sketches, let me provide an example of my own that resonates with his soundings. Page 271 A Rioting Mob: An Illustration These incidents occurred in a bout of rioting in Colombo on July 28, 1987. The proximate reason was the Indo­Sri Lankan Accord, which made it possible for an Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to occupy the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka with the objective of implementing the accord. The rioting in Colombo was done by the Sinhalese majority, who opposed the Jayewardene government's alleged giving of too many concessions to the Tamils and allowing an Indian intervention and occupation. The riot lasted only one day, but enough damage was done: nineteen civilians were killed and more than a hundred were reported wounded when police fired into the crowds. The mobs set fire to eighty buses, scores of cars, and a number of buildings, including shops, hospitals, and the Ministry of Women's Affairs. 8 The organizers had called upon the protesters to assemble at a junction in the Pettah shopping district in the center of Colombo, in close proximity to the central bus station and the Fort Railway Station, which facilitated travel to the site. Those who assembled at this well­chosen strategic spot were said to represent \"The Movement for the Defense of the Motherland,\" a coalition of some twenty parties and associations, united in their opposition to the treaty. The ruling United National Party sent not only police to keep order but also its henchmen belonging to a government union called Jatika Sevaka Sangamaya to show muscle and to disrupt the gathering. The SLFP was prominently represented by Mrs. Bandaranaike, her son Anura Bandaranaike, several members of Parliament, and party organizers. (Prins Gooneskera, a civil rights lawyer who had defended many people accused by the government of subversive activities, and Gamini Iriyagolle, a vocal nationalist, both anti­UNP, were also sighted.) The next most conspicuous presence was that of hundreds of Buddhist monks, the most prominent of whom were Reverend Muruttetwe Ananda, who held the unusual position of head of the Nurses Union (which had conducted a strike against the government), and Reverend Maduluwave Sobhita, who was known to be a left­wing sympathizer.9 There were many young men and women present, and it was alleged that many members of the JVP were also there. The mood was generally antagonistic to President Jayewardene, who was seen as having betrayed the country. The protest meeting was at first orderly. Reverend Sobhita said that there were only twenty­four hours left to stop the proposed Indo­Sri Page 272 Lankan Peace Accord from being signed. With emotions mounting, it seems that the police acted first by firing tear gas into the crowd—perhaps for \"preventive\" purposes, perhaps, at the same time, as a provocative serving of notice. From Gas Station junction and the Fort Railway Station end, the packed crowd split and streamed out in different directions—toward the bus stand in Pettah; down Gas Works Street into Pettah; toward the Fort (where the president's house and the main department stores, banks, and posh shops were located); toward Maradana, Borella, Panchikawatte, and so on. The main thoroughfare of Colombo, Galle Road, was avoided. The crowd in the vicinity of the Pettah bus stand burned some buses. The police appeared in vehicles and forced many monks into them. Seeing a massive crowd forming in the Fort with a view to besieging the president's house, the police fired tear gas again. And when a police van was immobilized, the police fired into the crowd and killed some sixteen to seventeen persons. An attempt by the crowd to block the road to Kotte where Parliament was to meet that day was foiled. The physical damage done by the crowd on this occasion is instructive. Only a few shops were burned or looted. The fury was directed against government property—buses, buildings (including the Ministry of Women's Affairs, which was on the route taken by a crowd stream), and a couple of railway stations. The protesters, many of whom were lay and monk students, who lived in the satellite suburbs ringing Colombo, such as Kelaniya, Nugegoda, and Moratuwa, where the new universities and cheap housing are located, planned to stage many processions into central Colombo the next day. But the government decided to block all the main arteries leading into the city—roadblocks were constructed at the Kelaniya Bridge and at main junctions in Ratmalana, Dehiwela, Nugegoda, and so on. This time, the crowds, blocked from entering the city's central parts, turned into destructive mobs, which went on a rampage, burning buildings mainly in suburbs such as Nugegoda and Ratmalana and farther afield in the satellite towns of Avissawella, Panadura, and beyond. The rioting and the Government's harsh response, a day before Mr. Gandhi is to fly in to sign the accord, increased doubts here about the chances for a peaceful resolution of the violent divisions in this nation of 16.6 million. Not far from the reviewing stand \\[being erected for the visiting prime minister\\], police retreated as windows were systematically smashed in the downtown shopping district, which also contains Government offices and international hotels. Page 273 In the back alleys of the central market area, rival mobs of young men armed with wooden staves, metal bars, and fluorescent light bulbs battled each other. They broke down shuttered storefronts and made bonfires of their contents. They tossed red and yellow grains into the air, smeared their faces with flour and hammered canned goods against the ground in a frenzy of destruction. Store owners hid in back rooms or on rooftops as the sounds of breaking glass and shouting approached them. They spoke in whispers, as if afraid to be heard on the street outside. Near the central railway station, amid black smoke from a burning police truck and several buses, the protesters taunted the police, hurling stones and bits of brick as well as rotting bones and hard fruits called wood apples from the marketplace. Helmeted police officers, crouching behind wicker shields, dropped to their knees and fired at the protesters past the burning vehicles. With each volley, flocks of birds rose from the tin roofs of the market stalls. Bodies lay in the hot sun as the melee swirled around them. A young woman in a blue dress, her head covered in blood, writhed slowly in the ground beside an overturned lottery booth. The rioting began in the early morning when thousands of political supporters of a former Prime Minister, Sirima Bandaranaike, carrying small black plastic flags, joined 150 monks in orange robes who sat in the shade of a sacred Bo Tree near the market place. The men with black flags stopped passing buses and forced their passengers to join them. Speaking into a hand­held microphone, the monks urged the crowd to protect the nation from division and warned of an eventual takeover by India. As the monks spoke, the police suddenly opened fire with small canisters of tear gas, and the day's running battle began. Some members of the crowd held back angry monks as they tried to charge police. As the police repeated volleys of tear gas, the crowd moved into the alleyways where Tamil, Sinhalese, and Moslem shop owners were already pulling shut their iron gratings. As the crowds grew, racing from one part of the old city area to another, pockets of outnumbered police officers pulled back with promises not to fire tear gas if the protesters left them alone. One chief inspector at the scene said the police were also having difficulty commanding their own mostly Sinhalese men. ''You cannot ask them to take strong action, you know,\" said the chief inspector, who asked that his name not be used. \"When it is Sinhalese doing it, the police sort of soft­ pedal.\" The chief inspector, a Tamil, said: \"I can't push my orders too hard. I have got to be careful.\" 10 This description of crowd behavior in Colombo could be replicated from many other parts of our globe, especially at the present time, when explo­ Page 274 sive behavior on the part of crowds is being reported almost daily. Two examples will suffice. In December 1989, for example, in the context of civilian protest actions against the Noriega dictatorship, \"Looters . . . swarmed through Panama City's downtown business district, leaving an ankle­deep carpet of glass shards that made many sidewalks all but impassable. In some areas, hardly a windowpane was intact. . . . Some store owners took up rifles and stood guard in front of their shops.\" 11 On the same day, in Bucharest, Romania, \"Residents hurled portraits of \\[former president Nicolae Ceausescu\\] onto bonfires that blazed around town. They fed the flames with signs ripped down from buildings that praised him and bore his statements on building communism.\"12 Canetti's Sketches Elias Canetti's Crowds and Power is a storehouse of observations on the behavior of crowds, some of which illuminate the behavior of mobs involved in ethnic riots. Canetti lists four general attributes of the crowd: (1) it always wants to grow; (2) within it, there is equality; (3) it loves density; (4) it needs a direction—it is in movement and it moves toward a goal. Ordinarily, human beings fear the touch of the unknown and avoid physical contact with anything strange, Canetti observes. \"It is only in a crowd that man can become free of this fear of being touched. . . . The feeling of relief is most striking when the density of the crowd is greatest.\"13 \"Only together can men free themselves from their burdens of distance; and this, precisely is what happens in a crowd. . . . It is for the sake of this blessed moment when no one is greater or better than another, that people become a crowd.\"14 Bill Buford amplifies this point by Canetti. He gives a powerful sense of the \"unusual intimacy\" felt in a densely packed football crowd: Something, I felt, was being communicated there; just about every member of that crowd of nine thousand \\[watching a game between Cambridge United and Millwall\\] was pressed closely against someone else and was held, as we were held, tightly together, waiting for a goal . . . there is no sport in which the act of being a spectator is as constantly physical as watching a game of English football on the terraces. The physicalness is insistent; any observer not familiar with the game would say it is outright brutal. . . . The English football game expects the spectator to become one with the crowd.15 It seems that a physically dense crowd also produces a psychic density. Individuals surrender themselves to the crowd, they all become equal, and distinctions, even of sex, do not count. And this is why, says Canetti, a \"crowd seeks to close in on itself.\" A rioting mob is an \"open crowd\": Page 275 \"there are no limits whatever to its growth; it does not recognize houses, doors, or locks and those who shut themselves in are suspect.\" However, an open crowd's spontaneous growth is at the same time its danger, \"for just as suddenly it originates, the crowd disintegrates.\" 16 The destructiveness of riot crowds is their most conspicuous feature. \"Of all the means of destruction the most impressive is fire. It can be seen from far off and it attracts even more people. It destroys irrevocably; nothing after a fire is as it was before. . . . After the destruction, crowd and fire die away.\"17 \"The crowd particularly likes destroying houses and objects; breakable objects like window panes, mirrors, pictures, and crockery . . . the noise of destruction adds to its satisfaction; the banging of windows and the crashing of glass are the robust sounds of fresh life, the cries of something new born. . . . But it would be wrong to suppose that the ease with which things can be broken is the decisive factor. . . . Sculptures of solid stone have been mutilated beyond recognition\"18 or have been hauled down. \"The destruction of representational images is the destruction of a hierarchy which is no longer recognized. It is the violation of generally established and universally visible and valid distances. . . . The more usual kind of destruction . . . is simply an attack on all boundaries.\"19 The destruction of windows and doors of houses is also the destruction of the individuality and separateness of houses and inmates. An Underlying Axis: Double Exchange Between Assailants and Victims There is, I suggest, a double exchange between assailants and victims that functions as the underlying axis of their relationship. These exchanges are dialectically related and derive from the tensions between the \"similarities\" (shared features) and the \"differences\" that relate the two parties. First, when a minority, or another community, is under attack by a crowd in the name of equalization of entitlements, then the wanton destruction of the lives and property of the \"enemy\" is inseparably accompanied by the personal appropriation and incorporation of that enemy's status, genius, and wealth. This orientation is what has already been labeled \"leveling\"—that is, eliminating the alleged advantages enjoyed by the opponent and redressing the inequality allegedly suffered by the aggressor, usually a majority. The looting of the victim's possessions, the raping of his womenfolk, are simultaneously forceful acts of incorporating the enemy, while destroying him. Thus these actions, which seem to be at the negative pole of reciproc­ Page 276 ity between self and other, also imply an extreme cannibalistic form of the fusion of self and other, and the obliteration of that dyad. The obliteration of the body of the victim by fire, cremation, simultaneously removes all evidence of the killed and the killer. A double anonymity is sought. The second exchange takes as its point of departure the fact that assailants and victims are frequently not strangers to one another. They have been \"neighbors\" in the loose sense of having lived in the same towns, or resided intermixed or side by side in contiguous districts and in neighboring towns, for long periods of time, and have had transactions of various kinds. \"The degeneration of a difference in convictions into hatred and fight occurs only when there were essential similarities between the parties,\" Georg Simmel notes. \"The 'respect for the enemy' is usually absent where the hostility has arisen on the basis of previous solidarity. And where enough similarities continue to make confusions and blurred outlines possible, points of difference need an emphasis not justified by the issue but only by that danger of confusion.\" 20 As Simmel has perceptively said, it is because of the sudden imposition of difference on the basis of previous solidarity and coexistence, and because of the \"blurred\" nature of the social landscape, that a perhaps overdetermined hatred and repudiation are unleashed in denial of \"confusions\" or lack of firm partitions between the antagonists. One might extend Simmel by saying that the greater the blurrings of and ambiguities between the socially constructed categories of difference, the greater the venom of the imposed boundaries, when conflict erupts, between the self and the other, \"us\" and \"them.'' No international military code of humane treatment of \"prisoners of war\" deriving from \"respect for the enemy\" regulates the conduct of Serb and Bosnian Muslim, Armenian and Azerbaijani, Hindu and Muslim in Kashmir, Sinhalese soldier and Tamil insurgent in Sri Lanka. Can we push this process of creating and repudiating the intolerable \"other\" in current ethnonationalist conflict any further? Can we say that it is because that component of \"sameness\" that the ethnic enemy shares with you, and because your enemy is already a part of you, that you must forcibly expel him or her from yourself, objectify him or her as the total other? Accordingly, that component of \"difference\" from you, whether it be allegedly \"religious,\" \"linguistic,\" or \"racial,\" is so exaggerated and magnified that this stereotyped \"other\" must be degraded, dehumanized, and compulsively obliterated? There is a third consideration which we should take into account as possibly central to the dynamics of ethnonationalist conflicts. The drive for the desired and imagined unity and homogeneity of an ethnic collective as Page 277 \"one nation\" is frequently difficult to consummate and doomed to be contentious and fractious because of multiple internal contests and differences and cross­cutting interests. And this situation may also engender a process that René Girard has elaborated on in Violence and the Sacred: the internal divisiveness and conflicts within a group or collectivity may drive its members to seek out a scapegoat and \"sacrificially\" kill it to gain its own uncertain unity, making of this cleansing a sacred act of generative unanimity and duty. 21 This links up with the suggestion, made earlier, that the targeted and victimized enemy next door usually shares much content and texture with the aggressor, and that the expulsion or annihilation of that enemy may therefore be a substitute for expelling or annihilating the enemy one harbors within oneself, which may account for the overdetermined brutality against and guiltless obliteration of the \"other.\" Interpretive Forays Canetti's allusive and intuitive reflections on the crowd's destructive and leveling tendencies are more soberly but perhaps even more powerfully recorded by Rudé, who appropriately cites Carlyle's aphorism: \"A short argument, fire.\" The major devices of the preindustrial crowds of England and France for 150 years or more, the expression of their leveling instinct, \"were direct action and the imposition of some form of elementary 'natural' justice.\" \"Strikers tended to destroy machinery or 'pull down' their employers' houses; food rioters to invade markets and bakers' shops and enforce a popular price control or taxation populaire; rural rioters to destroy fences and turnpikes or threshing machines and work houses, or to set fire to the farmers' or landlords' stacks; and city rioters to 'pull down' dissenters' meeting houses and chapels, to destroy their victims' houses and property, and to burn their political enemies in effigy.\"22 \"In England, arson, particularly the burning of the farmers' stacks of hay and corn, was a well established weapon in agrarian disputes.''23 Canetti's literary brushstrokes and Rudé's realism stir the memory of those of us who have seen riots, the smell of smoke and the sight of flames rising from rubber tires, serving as the necklaces of death, the burning cars and houses, the hauling down of statues of stately Queen Victoria, of proud British governors, of feared dictators like Stalin, and of once, and not so long ago, famous postindependence national leaders, the brazen crossing of boundaries by crowds, their invasion of the hitherto forbidden inner spaces of homes, and of the boardrooms and sanctums of government ministers and unapproachable bureaucrats, guarded by recalcitrant secretaries and officious \"peons.\" Page 278 On the basis of many accounts of, and visual information on, ethnic riots, it seems that crowds in action, even when they have been organized and led, become in their density and anonymity aggregates of deindividualized equals, who engage in destructive attacks on property and possessions and unleash impulses aimed at leveling the society and its hierarchy, or to obliterate differences among its groups. This may include the desecration of sacred pantheons of gods, saints, and heroes who represent that hierarchy and differences of status. In these ways, a riot mob may be said to be temporarily crossing boundaries, dissolving category distinctions and classifications, and acting as the creator and embodiment of liminal time. The rioting crowd is a \"hunting pack\" and a \"baiting crowd\"; it is out for killing and it knows whom it wants to kill and to expropriate. It strategically corners its enemy, and its feeling of omnipotence is a function of its immense superiority in numbers and weapons, and its knowledge that the victim can do nothing to retaliate. Also because the rioting is preceded by and can draw on the legitimation of populist politicians and populist tracts, the mob feels that the designated victim, if not actually sacralized for sacrifice in the Maussian sense, has nevertheless been made over to it for destruction, and that it therefore need not fear the sanction attached to killing. \"A murder shared with many others, which is not only safe and permitted, but indeed recommended, is irresistible to the great majority of men,\" Canetti observes. 24 And a victorious crowd can hold together only as long as it scores successes in quick succession. But a baiting and hunting crowd, so omnipotent and immunized against the guilt of killing, can also itself turn into a \"flight crowd\" the moment it feels that the enemy who survives, previously a helpless victim, but now feared as a threat, is on the warpath. Such is the black comedy and farce that surrounds crowds as fragile formations. During the Sri Lanka riots in 1983, after a few days when the Sinhalese mobs in Colombo had with some thoroughness destroyed Tamil houses and shops (but not actually taken many human lives), a rumor spread like wildfire that armed Tamil \"tigers\" had landed and were marching on the capital. The result was a headlong, undignified, panic­stricken stampede by masses of Sinhalese along Galle Road fleeing south—and when the fleers realized that the rumor was false the next day, they turned on the Tamils with added fury and committed brutalities from which they had previously refrained. Such reversals and tendencies of mood in rioting crowds give us a glimpse of another insight: the baiting and hunting mob, in attempting to eliminate its enemy, is thereby also trying to exorcise the possibility of its own death. And the more it kills the enemy, the more it feels menaced by Page 279 the enemy's imagined secret strength. And it is because fear sits side by side with the rage of destruction that a mob can by a sudden twist of events feel menaced by the enemy's revenge and its own death. At this point, it disintegrates and takes to flight. When in certain contexts of ethnic conflict, ethnic communities living side by side in their respective concentrations clash, chameleonlike reversals of hunters into fleers, and vice versa, are part of the sport of violence. And as long as this mood lasts, there is no dampening of passions, only periodic bloodletting, and a spiral of escalating violence. Eugéne Ionesco describes this mutual entanglement and death embrace in war in terms that are perhaps equally applicable to ethnic violence: I must kill my visible enemy, the one who is determined to take my life, to prevent him from killing me. Killing gives me a feeling of relief, because I am dimly aware that in killing him, I have killed death. My enemy's death cannot be held against me, it is no longer a source of anguish, if I killed him with the approval of society: that is the purpose of war. Killing is a way of relieving one's feeling, of warding off one's death. 25 To sum up, certain kinds of rioting crowds in pursuit of collective entitlements are essentially \"levelers,\" destroying property and life in a public cause that absolves them of individual crime and guilt. The leveling down of an ethnic group as an overprivileged enemy, an acquisitive other, an obstacle to one's own group's prosperity, is an orgiastic, short­lived action. If the ethnic group that is victimized still has in its possession the specialized knowledge, the material and symbolic capital, the networks that provide access to resources, it can usually pretty quickly recoup and regain its former position, thus inviting another act of leveling and conspicuous, methodical destruction of its property, a reverse potlatching. It is when such periodic leveling is accompanied by systematic political acts of discrimination and denial that succeed in robbing the victimized group of its special skills, resources, and channels of attainment that ethnic conflict moves from periodic bloodlettings, destruction of property, and displacement of people from their homes to a different level of attempted permanent subordination of a minority by a majority, and the countermove of secession on the part of the minority. Jubilant Destruction Canetti, Rudé, and others have missed out one conspicuous feature frequently noticed about riot crowds bent on arson, looting, and destruction. This is their ebullience and their near festive mood while engaging in destruction. The authors of two reports on the Delhi riots of 1984 wrote of Page 280 this with some puzzlement. Who Are the Guilty? (1984) 26 authored by two eminent Indian political scientists, remarked: It is significant that wherever we went, we did not find any sign of mourning or grief on the faces of those who were participating in the looting and burning. Attempts to pacify them by the peace marchers were met with derisive laughter. Listening to their raucous exultation and looking at their gleeful faces, one would have thought it was a festival, but for the arson and looting that was going on. The authors also report that when the peace procession in which they marched, organized to defuse the riots, pointed out that the innocent Sikhs who were being attacked were not responsible for Mrs. Gandhi's death, and raised the slogan \"Hindu­Sikh bhai bhai,\" disrupters shouted the counter­slogan \"Hindu­Hindu bhai bhai,\" proclaiming the brotherhood of Hindus and rejecting interethnic unity. The official Misra Commission remarked in passing: \"The mob was jubilating and dancing. There was no sign of sorrow and grief on their faces. They were no mourners of the Prime Minister.\"27 This report, astounded that the mobs were not grief­stricken but actually jubilant, readily resorted to the comfortable explanation that the riots were perpetrated by \"gangsters,\" \"anti­social elements,\" who were driven by \"mob frenzy\" and a \"lust for stolen articles.'' It was these elements who \"monitored the activities of the mobs and played the principal role in killing, looting, and arson.\"28 Little did the commission recognize the truth—which I have established earlier—that the rioters included a cross section of the ordinary citizens of the poorer urban settlement of Delhi and were quite often led by lower­level Congress (I) workers and activists, and by some higher­level politicians as well. It is my thesis that the jubilant and festive moods of rioting crowds are of a piece with their collective identity, their temporary sense of homogeneity, equality, and physical intimacy, their sense of taking righteous action to level down the enemy's presumed advantage and claim their collective entitlements. The same configuration also explains the crowd's lack of a sense of grief or remorse at its acts of destruction: because what participants have done does not call for individual personal accountability, a sense emboldened by the collusion of the police; it has received a patriotic benediction and has merged in an impersonal anonymity. It also participates in routinized and ritualized sequences of violence that further remove conduct from personal choice. But as we have seen, these jubilant, righteous crowds are also stricken by lurking anxieties and fears, which may become collective panics. The invention and circulation of rumors also portrays the Page 281 dual features of their energizing and stimulating the crowd as well as revealing the crowd's latent fears, which it projects onto its victims. Before I discuss rumors, I would like at this point to reiterate two implications of the concept of leveling. One relates to the politically motivated, purposive character of crowd violence devoted to diminishing or erasing the margin of advantage allegedly enjoyed by the rival designated as the enemy. This is leveling conduct motivated by the ideology of group entitlements. The second implication of such leveling is its psychic manifestation: fused in a relationship of leveling identity, the participants seem to suspend their individual wills and everyday restraints as they are swept into a collective passion, which expends its energy in destruction. The two processes of leveling meet and fuse in crowd actions. The Circulation of Rumors I would like to suggest certain connections between rioting crowds and their suggestibility to rumors, in a state of intensified passions. Rumors, let us note, although they are frequently planted and disseminated by agents provocateurs, generally appear anonymous in origin, and they cannot be traced to definite culpable sources; they are eminently oral utterances, they circulate at high velocity by word of mouth, nowadays through telephones, the radio, and TV, and are the currency of mass movements—whether they be revolutions, insurrections, or riots. 29 In the case of ethnic riots, they take a vicious form. All theorists of crowd psychology from Le Bon and Tarde to Freud are agreed that there is a leveling process in the second sense, by which individuals' reasoning powers are weakened or abrogated and reach a lowest common denominator. (The theorists diverge, however, on the precise relations between the individual and the crowd that engenders this state.) It seems plausible to suggest that leveling crowds engaged in communal violence are simultaneously prone to two psychic tendencies. They are aggressive and aggrandizing in the service of an imagined collective cause, and their courage comes through mutual stimulation; what they will not do individually, they will together. At the same time, they exhibit a marked anxiety and a lurking fear that their fortunes might well be reversed if their victims retaliate. A hunting crowd quickly turns into a crowd in flight. This double condition that makes aggressor crowds susceptible to rumors explains a curious twist. Frequently, the most inflammatory and gruesome rumors in riots are hatched and circulated by the aggressors about the victims (although at the later postmortem stage the victims in Page 282 turn convey their own horror stories to the authorities). In riots that last only a few days, the rumors begin to circulate the first day and have done their worst in terms of impact by the second, and it is usually on the second and third days that the worst brutalities to life and limb are committed and justified as \"reprisal.\" Riots subside after a few days, not only because law and order are restored, after a fashion, and the police and army once again parade the streets, but also because the mob's heightened psychic state cannot last beyond that time. Two processes working at two levels thus bring about the subsidence. Most participants cannot long remain without the restoration or recovery of their sense of separateness and \"individuality\" and the need to break away from the collective euphoric oppressiveness that elated them and to return to their everyday lives. Once the violence is spent, as in an orgasm, there is a return to quiescence. Then there can be a slow buildup of tensions, quarrels, frustrations, and demands pertaining to the same or similar continuing political conflict, to erupt again in violence at another time. The Spiraling of Rage and Panic: A Window onto \"Excesses\" and the Breaching of Boundaries Right through these chapters on ethnic conflict and collective violence, I have tried to probe, among other things, one perplexing and absorbing issue: how do crowds engage in destructive aggression to the point of arson and homicide? Although murder is not unknown in daily life, mass homicide—that is, a number of killings by crowds in the brief period of a riot—is an excessive act that breaks through ordinary norms of restraint. Yet for the most part, this homicide in ethnic conflict is usually seen as legitimate and justified, and it is not accompanied by public remorse on the part of the aggressors. In any case, it is rarely followed by arrest and prosecution in courts of justice. I have all along tried to provide some clues to this conduct: for example, the powerful stimulus and legitimation provided by a hegemonic mytho­historical ideology (compounded of race, religion, language, and territory) stating a collective entitlement to rule and dominate; the attribution of unfair differential advantages to the ethnic enemy, and purposive attempts at leveling by destruction of property, business, and manpower; from a certain point onwards, the direction of communal violence by \"organized\" leaders and riot captains and their henchmen; and the championing of ethnonationalist causes by political parties and movements that mobilize re­ Page 283 cruits and crowds for militant action. I have also suggested that the feeling that the community has endorsed the killing may free individuals from the burden of remorse and guilt. Le Bon's elucidation of the puzzle as to \"why crowds are not killers in their own eyes\" is in accord with my preceding statements. \"Certain acts of crowds are assuredly criminal, if considered merely in themselves,\" but the actors do not think so. \"The usual motive of the crimes of crowds is a powerful suggestion, and the individuals who take part in such crimes are afterwards convinced that they have acted in obedience to duty, which is far from being the case with the ordinary criminal.\" 30 The marauding crowd participant acts in \"obedience to a suggestion, which is all the stronger because of its collective origin, and the murderer's conviction that he has committed a very meritorious act, a conviction all the more natural seeing that he enjoys the unanimous approval of his fellow citizens.31 Now I want to push a little further into the mentality of killing crowds by advancing a more complex formulation than I have attempted so far. It takes as its point of departure the observation made a few pages earlier that a \"hunting pack\"—that is, a crowd bent on pursuing and killing its victims—can also quickly turn into a panic­ stricken \"flight crowd.\" (Incidentally, this phenomenon of mass flight is well illustrated in James Thurber's story \"The Day the Dam Broke.\") Some well­known and oft­repeated incidents in Colombo in July 1983 nicely illustrate the co­presence and oscillations of anger and panic. On the fifth day after the riots began, a Thursday morning, a mob assembled at the Fort Railway Station (Colombo's largest station, located at its commercial core), met the train arriving from Kandy, beat a number of Tamil passengers, and burnt them to death. On the following day, Friday, July 29, in Gasworks Street in Pettah, shots were fired by soldiers (the exact circumstances are not known). This incident was converted into a panic story of an attack being launched by invading Tamil Tigers. Ambassador Dissanayaka reports that frightened city workers . . . who owned cars drove at breakneck speed on both sides of the road as well as on the pavements. Others clambered on any type of vehicles \\[sic\\], cars, buses, lorries, vans and trishaws. While office workers behaved in this pitiable manner the slums of Colombo erupted again. Slum dwellers came out armed with axes, crow bars, iron rods and kitchen knives. . . . That day there were six tigers in Colombo. They were all in Dehiwela zoo.32 There was a massive stampede of civilians, even policemen and soldiers, fleeing from the enemy, in a tidal wave down Galle Road, the main seafront artery to the south. When the same crowds in flight realized their mistake, Page 284 they unleashed the worst brutalities thus far inflicted on the Tamils: cars were burned with passengers inside them, and any Tamil trapped by the crowd was branded a Tamil Tiger and lynched. Jonathan Spencer reports that after some stranded students got back to their provincial home in Sabaragamuva Province that weekend, carrying news of the alleged Tiger attack on Colombo, the dangerous presence of terrorists in that city had become an established fact for the residents in their remote village. 33 The suggestion I am making is that two seemingly antithetical states of mind and sets of experienced emotions may be co­present in the aggressor community and interact with each other with regard to its perception of an ethnic \"enemy.\" These are, simultaneously, rage and anger at the enemy's alleged attack on the integrity, values, or well­being of the community in question, on the one hand, and successively, or in oscillation, fear and mounting panic that the ethnic enemy is violent, dangerous by nature, and has the capacities and resources to launch an attack and do great harm, on the other. The rage and anger push the community to prepare to attack at the slightest \"provocation.\" The panic and fear push it toward collective hysteria and may lead to a wild swing toward retreat and flight. The two states of collective perception and emotion dialectically act on each other and produce a mounting tension and a heightened mood, which when it explodes may lead to terrible brutalities and acts of destruction, which may be labeled \"excesses.\" In this spiral of rage and panic, rumors that attribute gross brutalities to the \"enemy\" play a vital energizing and instigating role. Thus we begin to see how the \"demonization\" of the enemy is produced. It entails the attribution to the \"enemy\" and victim of violent and inhuman intentions, as well as superhuman propensities. An increasing alienation and polarization between the self as a ''son of the soil\" and the other as alien develops, and much that was previously shared now gives way to a suspicion­ridden separation and dehumanization of the other, so that to treat him as nonhuman and deserving of degradation and destruction becomes imperative and justifiable. So the aggressor community in attacking its enemy finally comes to perceive its actions as defensive and protective. Even a majority community may feel beleaguered and imperiled in this way. The enemy, already converted to the status of \"traitors\" and \"terrorists,\" must be punished, displaced, and destroyed. Rioting crowds are heterogeneous in composition, short­lived, and unstable. On the one hand, the sheer massing of persons in a crowd gives them a feeling of great power, even of omnipotence. But at the same time, since the crowd's members have tenuous links, united by heightened affect Page 285 but no long­lasting interactional bonds, they are liable, under certain circumstances, to disintegrate and lose their sense of mutuality. The reverse of their sense of power is their sense of vulnerability. The rumors that circulate from member to member like wildfire both energize them with anger and at the same time cause panic. One of the central features uncovered in this discussion is that neither the rumors nor the anger and panic that they create bear much realistic or \"objective\" relation to the danger that allegedly threatens the crowd. Panic frequently leads to the disintegration of the crowd and the evaporation of the emotional ties that hold it together temporarily. \"The mutual ties have ceased to exist and a gigantic senseless fear is set free,\" 34 which disperses the crowd in disarray. But the crowds reform again, spurred on by street leaders and riot captains and their use of rhetoric, rumor, and techniques of mobilization. They go on the attack again, feeling euphoric and omnipotent, but retreat is not far behind. I would like to illustrate this thesis by reference to the outbreak of the 1983 riots in Sri Lanka. I shall use as my sources separate essays by two anthropologists, Elizabeth Nissan and Jonathan Spencer, who describe the mood of the Sinhalese before and during the violence they committed against Tamils, and the justification they gave for their actions.35 It is noteworthy that Nissan's view of the riots is from the vantage point of Anuradhapura, a populous historic city in the \"distant\" North­ Central Province, and Spencer's view is also from a relatively remote village on the southern edge of Sabaragamuwa Province in the central highlands. The 1983 riots began in Colombo and then spread outwards,36 and our two commentators report first on the provincial moods at their field sites and then move from the periphery to the center and back as violence radiates out from the capital. Nissan reports these views expressed by Sinhalese citizens of Anuradhapura just before and during the riots: \"Those Tamils\" had come to \"our country\"; \"they come here and now they are trying to divide the country\"; ''we have given them a lot but they always want more.\" These judgments were grounded in the premise that Sri Lanka was inherently a Sinhalese state, and that Tamils challenged it, thus bringing the wrath of the Sinhalese down on their heads. They had only themselves to blame. But at the same time, Nissan reports that although there were only a few Tamils now left in Anuradhapura after their extradition some six years previously, and no actual violence was unleashed there during the 1983 riots, yet \"there was fear in Anuradhapura that the town would be attacked Page 286 by Tamil Tigers, descending on this most northern Sinhalese town from the Jaffna peninsula.\" This fear was \"not just local, but . . . had been generalized to the point where, in Colombo panic broke out on Friday 29 July when it was believed that Tigers were attacking the city.\" 37 Spencer similarly reports many stories circulating in his village about Tamil Tigers being sighted in the vicinity and carrying out murders in the area. These are evidence of the \"panic that swept through Sinhalese areas in the build up to the riots\" and the expectation of imminent large­scale violence.38 And the Sinhalese newspapers fed this mood by failure to report accurately or misreporting incidents as the work of Tamil terrorists. In another essay, Spencer elaborates on the rumors feeding panic and the mounting demonization and fear of the Tamils: In the months before the rioting, fear of the Tigers, and the possibility of attacks in the south, had been built up in the Sinhala press. . . . With the imposition of curfew and censorship and the apparent breakdown of the civil administration, rumors about the Tigers grew and developed dramatically—how they were on their way to attack the Temple of Tooth in Kandy, how they were going to poison the water supply of major towns, how they had travelled south from Jaffna hanging on the underside of trains (for 300 miles in a week when the trains were not running) or dressed in military uniform under disguise as priests. . . . In other words, the actions of the Tigers in the north, filtered through a propagandist press and a mesh of cultural stereotypes about the violent Tamil provokes an air of panic in which ever more outlandish rumors spread and flourished. . . . The worst attacks in 1983 were, in the atmosphere, conceived as defensive responses to the threat of superhuman Tamil violence.39 Ever since the late 1970s, when Tamil youth in desperation became militant insurgents, and thereafter successfully withstood and even got the better of the Sinhala army of occupation, Sinhalese chauvinists had been frustrated and flustered over the puncturing of their virile right of domination, established by Dutthagamani.40 Increasingly, then, \"the actions of the Tigers began to be interpreted in terms of dominant representations of violence and otherness. They were believed to be superhumanly cruel and cunning and, like demons, ubiquitous.\" \"This is the background to the panic which gripped the country in July 1983. . . . The rumors . . . clearly express partly developed but usually unacknowledged collective fears, and in their rapid development they seem to represent a kind of instant mythologizing in which terrifying new experiences were reinterpreted in terms of more familiar cultural structures\"41—especially, it would seem, a repertoire of demonic images, whose grip on Page 287 the Sinhala imagination has been vividly described and interpreted to us by Bruce Kapferer. 42 Yet another process of image transference, which both Nissan and Spencer document, ex post facto justified the killing of Tamil civilians to the rioters and their supporting public. This was an identification \"between all Tamils and those involved in violent separatist activity,\"43 and, by extension, identifying all Tamils as both terrorists and enemies of the Sinhala state. The ultimate implication was that the Tamil is an inherently violent and dangerous creature, made even more fearsome by his cunning. And \"for many Sinhalese people, away from centers of trouble, the Tamils, far from being victims, were assumed to be at least equal partners if not the protagonists in the rioting.\"44 Spencer describes well how by converting every Tamil into a \"terrorist\" and reading any defensive act on the part of an ambushed Tamil to be evidence of terrorist inclinations, the rioters were able to justify and live with their violence. Although the greater part of the violence was directed at property and not at people, killings did take place. \"Whenever any Tamil attempted to defend himself or his property he became, by definition, a 'terrorist', and the mood of the crowd (and, in some cases, of the security forces), changed dramatically.\" Firing into the air to disperse the crowd could actually provoke a massacre.45 \"In other words, a thread of insane logic links a number of these incidents—aggression against the crowd, even in some cases simply running away from the crowd, was, ipso facto, evidence of terrorism, of being a Tiger. Clearly and objectively, this was never the case; equally clearly and objectively, this was what the crowd believed to be the case.'' \"Embarrassed and ashamed by the news of murder, many Sinhalese people were relieved to hear that those killed had been 'terrorists.'\"46 Fear and Panic During the Delhi Riots These examples from Sri Lanka can be matched with utterances and events pertaining to the Delhi riots of 1984. Although the growing antagonism between the Sikhs and Hindus has progressively involved large numbers on both sides in inter­ and intra­community violence, especially in the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, yet in the case of the riots of 1984 in Delhi, the aggressors were an enormous majority of Hindus and the victims a small minority of under 10 percent of that city's population. This radical situation suitably illustrates the double play of rage and panic on the side of the aggressors. Page 288 As the documentation of interviews with residents shows, it was the majority Hindu assailants who manufactured and propagated rumors of sinister unpatriotic and criminal behavior by the Sikhs and also attributed to their victims aggressive propensities and greater resources of wealth and knowledge. Speaking to the authors of The Delhi Riots about events in his colony, \"which witnessed the murder of more than 300 Sikhs, large scale arson and looting,\" Mala Ram, a pradhan (local community leader) of Block 18 in Trilokpuri recalled that the day after Indira Gandhi's assassination, a factory in nearby Noida went up in flames: It was a very large fire and there was a lot of noise. . . . After the fire subsided a very large kafila \\[collection of people\\] . . . entered our colony and they were shouting \"Sardars are coming, Sardars are coming. . . . They are armed with kirpans \\[dagger or sword, one of the five Sikh symbols\\].\" Everyone got into a panic thinking that the Sardars would attack them and ran into their homes. That mob then did all the gadar \\[disturbance\\] in our colony. 47 The interviewer then posed this question to Mala Ram (and his neighbors): \"Tell us something about this panic you felt that the Sardars were coming. Everywhere in Delhi we have heard that people reacted in the same panic stricken way when they heard that the Sardars were coming. . . . Now suppose the word had gone around that the Harijans \\[depressed scheduled castes\\] were coming, no one would have run off.\" Mala Ram and his neighbors, who are themselves Harijans, had this to say: \"We are weak so who would be scared of us?. . . . Harijans are weak economically as well as politically. Harijans are weak in every sense. . . . The Sardars are economically strong; they are also in good positions everywhere.\" No satisfactory reply came when the interviewers pointed out: \"But the Sardars who were killed here were poor scheduled caste people.\"48 As we saw in chapter 5, a middle­class lady from Gujarat named Ratnabehn witnessed horrible attacks on Sikh passengers at Tughlakabad railway station by a crowd armed with iron rods, cycle chains, and kerosene. To the question, \"What was the mob saying as they attacked?\" Ratnabehn replied: They said that the trains were being fired upon by Sikhs at Nizamuddin with guns. They told us to hide in the upper berths to save ourselves, otherwise we might get killed. They said that the trains are coming from Punjab with dead bodies of Hindus. They said, \"You don't know what the conditions of your brothers and sisters are, they are cutting off the hands of your Hindu sisters.\" \\[Hands wearing bangles and rings, which were looted?\\] In fact, at no time during the Delhi riots, as such, did Sikhs attack trains or kill any passengers. Page 289 The Moors are Coming: Rumors in the 1915 Riots in Sri Lanka In the 1915 riots in Sri Lanka, A. P. Kannangara reports, rumors sped along the routes by which violence spread, \"igniting riots in one place after another.\" These rumors, although \"modified and embellished on their way, were everywhere of a religious character.\" In Kandy and its suburbs, and as far as Gampola, the rumour was that the Muslims had attacked or were about to attack the Dalada Maligawa \\[the Temple of the Tooth Relic\\]. Further afield the commonest rumour was that the Moors, some said armies of Moors, were advancing on the Sinhalese, intent on the destruction of Buddhist temples, and on murder and rape. These rumours were accompanied or followed by others which suggested that Sinhalese who joined in taking revenge against the Muslims would go unpunished. Since Great Britain was at war with Turkey, the government would, it was said, welcome attacks on the Moors, and had decided to allow six days during which Sinhalese would be free to carry out their attacks. Another rumour was that since the governor \\[Sir Robert Chalmers\\] was a Buddhist, he would pardon Buddhists who punished the Moors for their sacrilege. 49 The effect of these rumours on the bazaar­poor in Buddhist areas may be gauged from that which they had in some other quarters. In Kotte, a township outside Colombo, the rumours brought out several leading Sinhalese residents, including government officials. Near Kandy, Walgampaya, who . . . was the chief lay trustee of the Gadaladeniya Devale, collected a crowd on the premises and went out at their head, sword in hand, presumably to head off the advancing Moors. Some European officers engaged in trying to quell the riots felt impelled to check rumours that nearby temples and bazaars had been attacked by the Moors. There was also the police magistrate who was at Heneratgoda when rumours arrived that two thousand Moors were advancing towards that town, and crowds of Sinhalese gathered to defend it. He told the Police Inquiry Commission that he had believed these rumours, promised the Sinhalese to help them in repelling the invasion, and made preparations to do so. In Kotahena, Mutwal and other Catholic localities further north of Colombo, church bells were rung when rumours arrived that the Moors were coming to attack the churches, and large crowds came out in defence. In Mutwal it was the local policemen who first ran out to repel the Moors, shouting the alarm to local residents. To some places the rumours were brought from Colombo, Kandy and other towns and bazaars by people such as carters, pilgrims, traders, city­workers and visitors to weekly markets on their way home. But many set out in order to carry the fearful news or, like the gangs of people who moved from bazaar to bazaar attacking Muslim shops, the example of what ought to be done to punish the Muslims. At Nawagamuwa, and perhaps at some other temples too, Buddhist monks and others, convinced that a Muslim attack was imminent, sent men on bicycles to raise the alarm and summon help. In several bazaars Page 290 the rumours reached crowds which had already assembled for some special occasion or another. Kandy, as we have seen, was crowded with Wesak pilgrims. In Gampola the bazaar was crowded with people who had come to attend a religious procession which had been arranged for that day. In Wattegama and some other towns the rumours arrived while weekly fairs were in progress. But generally the crowds were assembled by the force of the rumours. Some of these crowds started at once to attack the local Muslims, to punish them for what their co­religionists had done elsewhere. Other groups moved from bazaar to bazaar attacking Muslim shops and mosques. But in most places the first impulse was defensive. In Hanguranketa, Panadura and several other towns, the crowds collected in the local temple or marched towards it in order to defend it. Some crowds travelled several miles either to meet the advancing Moors or to make their stand at a point along the road leading to the township. Others made for places where their fellow caste members were said to be under attack. Yet the desire for revenge quickly supervened. Some crowds, having been turned back by force or by persuasion began, as for example at Malabe, to burn and loot the nearest Moorish shops, houses and mosques. Others turned to the attack when the Moors whom they were awaiting or marching to meet did not arrive. In many bazaars crowds often hesitated and hung back from attack, for several hours in one or two places. Then someone would throw a stone at a mosque or a Moor shop, and the rest would follow suit. 50 Kannangara's account thus confirms a number of features noted in connection with other ethnic disorders: the aggressor group is the source of the initial rumors, which quickly spread; these rumors usually allege that the group to be attacked threatens the core values, institutions, and persons of the aggressor group; offensive actions are thus claimed to be defensive; the rumors themselves operate to collect crowds; while rumors are publicly, anonymously, and insidiously passed from mouth to mouth, there are usually a few key mobile circulating agents provocateurs and riot gangs who are key points of transmission, coining new rumors and embellishing old ones; and \"panic and rage\" feed each other in the spiraling of violence. This would seem to lend support to the supposition that we are touching here on phenomena typical of crowd actions. Projection and Aggression Some aspects of the psychological theory of projection may be harnessed to add further depth to our exploration of the construction and transmission of rumors that in turn kindle physical violence. To begin with, when any group or community constructs its own myths of origin, stories of victories and conquests, and lives of exemplary culture heroes, it also directly and indirectly denigrates and blackens the traditions of the opponent neighbors and contestants against whom its accomplishments are measured. Page 291 There is a further dimension to projection. What is of greater significance is \"the need to have others as containers for one's own disavowed aspects.\" 51 So in rumors during ethnic conflict, one can see that the aggressor's negative characterization of the other may in part at least consist of separating off negative propensities and tendencies one fears in oneself and then projecting and externalizing them and pinning them on the victim. The projection may substantively consist of excesses one fears in oneself as well as weaknesses one senses one harbors; they are the shapes of one's rage as well as one's panic. When, in the course of ethnic conflict, two groups are simultaneously or in turn aggressor and victim, the rumors and prejudices and distortions emanating from both sides may reveal the disavowed and feared aspects of one's own collectivity as much as the stereotyped misperception and mistranslation of the other's traditions and practices. The Relative Motions of Ethnic Crowds The illustrations given from the 1915 and 1983 Sri Lankan riots pertain to situations where a dominant majority community (the Sinhalese) launched riots against minority communities (the Muslims and the Tamils). (Unfortunately, we have no parallel account of the moods, anger, and fears of the Tamils and Muslims before and during the riots.) In the Delhi riots of 1984, it was again a majority that attacked a minority, and similar rumors were spawned by the aggressor majority against the demonized victims. In the 1958 riots in Sri Lanka, the same trends have been documented. These trends suggest the following hypothesis. In ethnic conflict, when a majority periodically attacks a vulnerable minority, the physical violence directed by the former is also accompanied by distorted rumors detrimental to the victim. Thus while it may be that the prejudice and distorted perception may precede and lead to violence as cause and effect, the more important truth perhaps is that the motion toward collision combines distorted perception and active violence as parallel and complementary processes, and the faster the motion toward collision, the greater in intensity are the rumor­waves of prejudice and demonization produced. This process also implies the opposite motion: that when riots subside—and they do so quite rapidly—there is a cooling effect and a diminution of distorted rumors and prejudices, until the pressures toward collision mount again. In grappling with conceptualizing processes manifested by collective violence in the course of widespread ethnonationalist conflict in the world today, processes that defy understanding in terms of traditional models of Page 292 order, stability, and transformation and change, I was prompted to explore whether there were formulations in the physical sciences that I might, in a loose analogical sense, creatively try to \"translate\" into nonmechanistic theories of communicative processes and intersubjective understandings. I request the indulgence of the reader with regard to the remaining part of this chapter while I try my experiment of translating certain notions pilfered from physics such as \"the Doppler effect\" and \"catastrophe,\" \"chaos,\" and \"turbulence\" theories to describe some of the processes of collective violence outlined earlier. Thus let us go back to the hypothesis stated a few paragraphs back, the dynamics of which could be characterized as the two effects of the relative motions of ethnic collectivities described in terms of the Doppler effect. 52 When two collectivities compete within the same arena and space for what are perceived to be limited resources and rewards, their misperceptions and animosity increase in tandem. The waves of prejudice, accusations, and rumors increase in frequency, and the preparedness for violence intensifies, as the waves cumulatively back into each other and create the \"blue shift\" effect—the high frequency of blue­ and white­hot intensity. Again, as the sound waves of mutual reproach emitted on both sides approach each other, and their frequency of emission also increases, the louder and shriller the noise produced grows. The collision produces maximum noise and heat, generating a destructive explosion. The opposite motion of two collectivities is conducive to the \"red shift\" effect. When two collectivities move away from each other, in the sense that they are not competitors within the same space, and each collectivity finds its niche in an environment of \"division of labor,\" \"pluralism,\" and therefore of tolerance, the waves of mutual antagonistic perception become weaker and are of lower frequency, and therefore of a warmer hue and lower pitch of sound. Ethnic groups in this context do develop their distinctive cultural stereotypes of one another, but they are not mutually annihilative and intolerant. There is in this phase a greater chance of a tolerance, accommodation, and even appreciation of diversity. Attack and Flight: The Unstable Extreme What is called catastrophic instability is also detectable in the volatile behavior of crowds. Suppose that we can in some measure gauge the level of anger and rage in the members of a crowd (a state of affect produced dialogically and through interpersonal effects) and then postulate that when that anger reaches a certain threshold, it is expressed or transformed into the form of Page 293 physical attack. Suppose that, as is plausible, the members of the crowd are simultaneously in a state of fear and panic, and that when panic reaches a certain threshold, it is expressed as or transformed into flight. If our two control variables anger/rage and fear/panic increase together among the members of a crowd, and if the two thresholds are approached simultaneously, the crowd's behavior becomes unpredictable and unstable, and can switch abruptly from attack to flight and vice versa. In this \"catastrophe model,\" we have two incompatible control variables, which are continuous, but in interacting antagonistically produce discontinuous or unstable states. Such modeling, even if difficult to apply empirically to rioting crowds in terms of \"measurement,\" at least helps us to understand dimly how in many of the descriptions of rioting crowds given earlier, there are many instances of crowds attacking and retreating, coalescing quickly and breaking up in flight equally quickly, the onslaughts coming in waves of attack and quiescence, especially at that phase of the riots when aggression, rumormongering, and fear have reached the climactic point of unpredictable oscillation, maximum brutality, and demonization. Social Dissociation and Stereotyping Continuing in the spirit of ludic speculation, let me now, taking a leaf from \"psychology,\" propose that a process of \"social dissociation\" is increasingly at work in situations of collective violence as a result of the communicational processes discussed earlier (including rumors), thereby further sharpening and narrowing the stereotyped image of the ethnic or sectarian enemy in the eyes and minds of the aggressors, in terms of both perception and affect. An aspect of this social dissociation is the depersonalization of members of the opposed collectivity so that they are homogenized and leveled into an undifferentiated, simplified negative stereotype. Such intensified stereotyping allows for a narrowed and focused obsession directed at the vilified enemy, and under the sense of collective legitimation, permits people to engage with concentrated energy in transgressive acts of violence against which there are restraints in everyday life, but virtually none in the altered state. Let me insert the reminder that these intensified collective communicational states and acts are temporary states, of relatively short duration, from which the actors make an exit when the riots are over. The temporary experience of merging the self in such narrowed, focused dissociation in a collective context may perhaps also give us a clue to why rioters, after a spate of orgasmic violence, retrospectively recollect and speak of their actions in a distanced and neutral tone, cordoning them off as separate and Page 294 not imperative to remember and to bring into intimate relation to their everyday selves. (At the same time, we need to remember that riots can occur serially and intermittently, and that aggressors can therefore make parallel intermittent entries and exits.) By contrast, it is the victims who remember and tell and retell the story of the violence and their experience of victimization and suffering, and thus by repetition shape their narratives into a standardized or ritualized lament, which is then progressively shared by the community of sufferers as a collective memory, with its stereotyped narrations. On the victims' side, the individual, personal, familial, sudden, and inchoate experience of first strike, arson, displacement, and injury are progressively and retrospectively shaped into more coherent and ratified reports of collectively shared suffering, and crystallized into a collective memory. The collectivity of aggressors would in time prefer their individual remembrances to be eroded by amnesia. It is the victims who do the work of remembering and memorializing as a collective experience. The Turbulence of Crowds There are many features of the outbreak and trajectory of collective violence such as civilian riots that are difficult to predict or chart in terms of systematic process. When exactly—on what day and time—in the atmosphere of a charged political context does a riot break out? In which place and site among a number of possible sites does it begin? What phases does violence go through, and when and how does violence change into a frenzied state of arson and carnage? And how does it dissipate itself, and calm down? I have tried at several places to describe and chart the course and duration of the cases we have examined. It seems that while we are about it, we might with a sense of playful curiosity dip into some formulations in physics concerning \"turbulence\" and see what analogical transfers we can make. This is not an entirely outrageous move. Some anthropologists of the pre­postmodern era (especially the \"structural­functionalists\") did play with notions of \"steady state equilibrium,\" \"moving equilibrium,\" ''oscillating equilibrium,\" and so on (I may add to this collection my own interest in the zoologist Stephen Jay Gould's concept of \"punctuated equilibrium\"), although none ventured into \"chaos\" theory. Turbulence in fluid dynamics signifies \"a mess of disorder at all scales, small eddies within larger ones,\" James Gleick writes. \"It is highly unstable. It is highly dissipative, meaning that turbulence drains energy and creates drag.\" Page 295 When flow is smooth, or laminar, small disturbances die out. But past the onset of turbulence, disturbances grow catastrophically. . . . Like much of chaos itself, phase transitions involve a kind of macroscopic behaviour that seems hard to predict by looking at microscopic details. . . . At a certain temperature and pressure, the change becomes sudden and discontinuous. A rope has been stretching; now it breaks. 53 The material has entered a new realm. It is gratifying to find that physicists investigating various branches of \"chaos theory\" do not believe in unending and unaccountable disorder and are trying to discern the patterns and processes that lead to, maintain, and slow down turbulence. But the answers sought have to be in terms of a theory of nonlinear systems. How does a social flow cross the boundary from smooth to turbulent? How might small­scale tensions and petty conflicts that are usually settled or mitigated by the usual norms of restraint and mechanisms of social control get out of hand and cumulatively produce social turbulence. Looking back to the allusion above to the \"blue shift\" and \"red shift\" effects of rumors created when two sources meet in collision or recede into distance—processes and effects that can be extended to all forms of agonistic communicative events—can we envisage a state of turbulence being generated by a piling up of competing and unstable new waves and motions, with their different frequencies, such that they not only simply additively accumulate but also create rhythms with overlapping speeds and sizes, quickly reaching a state of unstoppable turbulence? When more energy comes into a system a Russian expert on fluid dynamics has conjectured, ''new frequencies begin one at a time each incompatible with the last, as if a violin string responds to higher bowing by vibrating with a second, dissonant tone, and then a third, and a fourth, until the sound becomes an incomprehensible cacophony.\"54 I have sought through the concepts of focalization and transvaluation to describe the piling up of different local conflicts to form a larger­scale turbulence, and the parallel crystallization of small­scale crowds in multiple locations, which at times merged in short­lived larger outbursts, to break up into fragments again once the orgasm of destruction had dissipated the frenzy of energy and passion. The concepts of nationalization and parochialization were employed to describe, as, for example, in the case of the demolition of the mosque in Ayodhya and the subsequent urban riots, the opposite processes whereby causes and campaigns promoted as \"national\" in scope have an impact on multiple local sites and communities and work themselves out according to local fault lines and locally significant issues. Page 296 But these (and other processes) have to be fitted into the larger context of constraints, parameters, and capacities that obtain in a particular situation of ethnic conflict. The parameters and the degrees of freedom within which a particular instance of collective violence is staged have something to do with factors such as these: (1) the nature of the locality and the demographic distribution of the groups involved, and the presence of leaders who can organize and of personnel who can be mobilized for action; (2) the antecedent relations between these groups, both competitions, tensions, and collisions and cooperation, coalitions, and accommodation; (3) the logistics of the available transportation system and communication media; (4) the technology of violence currently available to the actors; (5) the disposition and commitments of the police and security forces, and of the larger apparatus of state power; and (6) the targets and sites chosen for attack and defense. The repertoire and capacities that constitute the cultural capital and arsenal from which the component units and phases of collective violence are drawn include the following: the calendar of festivals; the stock of performances, processions, orations, and public protests; stereotyped labelings and rumors, formally recognized insults, triggering actions, and shamings; and the array of communications media (newspapers, posters, television, VCRs, tapes, etc.) available and deployed. All these help shape the swirls, cumulative rhythms, and phased transitions, in the rise and fall of collective violence in public arenas. Page 297 11 Reconfiguring Le Bon and Durkheim on Crowds as Collectives Le Bon on the Age of Crowds Although he has been subject to many ambivalent evaluations—regarding the originality of his ideas (many of which had previously been articulated by the Italian Scipio Sighela and the Frenchman Gabriel de Tarde), regarding his political conservatism and deep antipathy to socialist and democratic ideals and practices (Robert Merton calls him \"a dismayed if not hopelessly frightened conservative\"), 1 and, finally, regarding his tendency to reduce the essentials of crowd psychology to a \"racialist basis\"—Gustave Le Bon's Psychologie des foules is nevertheless a classic, and even if it is flawed, it is worth treating as a foil. Le Bon's characterization of his time, \"the age we are about to enter will in truth be the era of the crowds,\" was prescient, in that it all too well described the epoch of Nazism and Fascism and World War II. Serge Moscovici has elaborated on this theme.2 And now in the 1990s, with the competition among nationalities and subnationalities throughout Eastern Europe, and especially in the successor states to the defunct USSR and Yugoslavia, Le Bon's prophecy seems to have come alive again. It is alive not only in Europe but worldwide. Ethnic conflict, accompanied by civilian riots, army actions, and insurrectionary movements, is rife in many places. I am not concerned here to restate and reexamine Le Bon's argument, but to recover from his work theses that seem relevant to my theme, which I shall adapt and reformulate to suit the style of our time. I find these of Le Bon's ideas interesting and relevant to ponder: (1) that in crowds there is \"an intensification of the emotions\" and \"the inhibition of the intellect\"; (2) that in crowds \"unconscious mental processes\" dominate over conscious, rational, and critical processes; and (3) that because of Page 298 a \"lack of emotional restraint\" and \"an incapacity for moderation and delay,\" there is thus a rush of \"intolerance\" toward the other. I am even tempted to leap over or bypass Le Bon's dichotomy between intellect and emotion—a lowered intellect and heightened emotion—by postulating that when large crowds form, there is a tendency for ideas with high emotional valence—like images of fatherland, motherland, one people, the brotherhood of man, and so on—to constitute collective sentiments with a strong impulsion toward their collective realization in action. Le Bon put the matter in this way: \"We see then the disappearance of the conscious personality, the predominance of the unconscious personality, the turning by means of suggestion and contagion of feelings and ideas in an identical direction, the tendency immediately to transform the suggested ideas into acts.'' 3 The processes of interaction between the persons who constitute a crowd that transform them into a fused collectivity are a related set of themes touched on by Le Bon, who speaks of the role of \"emotional contagion\" and \"suggestibility\" in the crowd and in organized groups, which create a homogeneity and conformity of sentiments and actions. (Tarde's notion of \"imitation\" focused on the same issue.) It is in adumbrating these features of homogeneity and conformity of sentiments, and the impulsion to act upon them, that Le Bon uses the felicitous term leveling, which Elias Canetti seemingly coined independently or used without attribution. I have throughout this book referred to manifestations of leveling behavior on the part of rioting crowds in ethnic conflict. Let me now try to differentiate and formalize the various forms of leveling conduct: in the domain of collective ideology, mytho­ history, and collective \"entitlement claims,\" stemming from and rooted in conceptions of imagined communities of nation, people, language, and territory, we see leveling in terms of all members holding the same or similar images and visions of their legacy and their destiny. \"Appeals to sentiments of glory, honour, and patriotism are particularly likely to influence the individual forming part of a crowd, and often to the extent of obtaining from him the sacrifice of his life.\"4 I have described rioting ethnic crowds, imbued with ideas of unfair and illegitimate advantages allegedly enjoyed by the enemy group, usually a minority, engaging in acts of destruction, arson, looting, and killing in order to reduce the enemy's margins of advantage in material resources, educational, professional, and commercial skills, manpower, and cultural capital. There is a double imagery here: the attempted leveling of social advantages is accomplished as a physical leveling to the ground of buildings and a mowing down of persons. Page 299 Another context and site of leveling is in the processes and techniques of indoctrination and transmission of collective dogmas by means of a tailored rhetoric of persuasion and incitement through oratory exercised in rallies, processions, electoral meetings, and legislative assemblies, printed propaganda, and the electronic media. My earlier elucidation of the cultural repertoire of ritualized and stereotyped forms that are drawn upon in staging public events such as elections, protest movements and strikes, and civilian riots can be further enriched by grafting to it these insights. The oratorical rhetoric that influences crowds exploits these devices: themes and issues tend to be radically simplified and at the same time exaggerated, as often happens in advertisements. Furthermore, the simplified and exaggerated truth is simply affirmed as true, in the manner of axioms, and ex cathedra pronouncements, and not demonstrated by argument (crowds are impatient of reasoned lectures). Finally, \"affirmation has no real influence unless it is constantly repeated, and so far as possible in the same terms.\" 5 In my previous analysis, I have underscored and repeatedly returned to the matter of the invention and circulation of rumors that are simultaneously anonymous, secretive, and public, and that energize crowds with their distorted news. Le Bon's own treatment of this issue may well add something. How does one explain \"the facility with which are created and propagated the most improbable legends and stories\" noticed among crowds?6 There are two features to the answer Le Bon gives. The first, which we might expect once we grasp his perspective, is that crowds become \"excessively credulous,\" because \"hovering on the borderland of unconsciousness,\" they tend to lose their critical faculty and the influence of reasoning upon it. They uncritically fall prey to contagious suggestion. The second feature represents a more interesting and also controversial interpretive move. The crowd's \"imagination\" in a throng is heightened and transformed because it thinks in, and is susceptible to, \"images\"; and an image, a distorted vision, once let loose by one individual, is the starting point for a \"contagious suggestion.\" The crowd may thus actually see and confirm an illusion, such as St. George appearing on the walls of Jerusalem to all the Crusaders, or a candle signaling from an upper story to besiegers during the siege of Paris. \"Such is always the mechanism of the collective hallucinations so frequent in history—hallucinations which seem to have all the recognized characteristics of authenticity, since they are phenomena observed by thousands of persons.''7 Le Bon raises, but does not actually explain \"the mechanism of a collective hallucination.\" Nor to my knowl­ Page 300 edge have his successors. But we cannot deny the reports one repeatedly receives of collective illusory or hallucinatory visions that are \"seen\" by crowds and spur them to action. They are as potent as rumors similarly taken to be true. The question of the role of leadership in the creation of the crowd mentality he described was up to a point taken up by Le Bon and not too well integrated into his general description. One important explanation of why crowds are so suggestible, credulous, and mobile, and show a decline in intellectual critical attitudes and an upsurge of unconscious emotional intensity, was that they fell under the influence of leaders. Le Bon dramatically referred to the \"thirst for obedience\" that marks the crowd conformist. \"A crowd is a servile flock that is incapable of ever doing without a master\"; the leader is \"the first element in the organization of heterogeneous crowds, and paves the way for their organization in sects.\" 8 Since Le Bon's \"heterogeneous crowds,\" despite their simplified stereotyping, are similar in some ways to the kinds of crowds we have encountered in ethnic riots, it is of interest to see how he characterizes the role of crowd leaders. The leaders of these crowds \"are more frequently men of action than thinkers. . . . their convictions are so strong that all reasoning is lost upon them.\" The leaders of crowds wield a very despotic authority, and this despotism indeed is a condition of their obtaining a following. It has often been remarked how easily they extort obedience, although without any means of backing up their authority, from the most turbulent section of the working classes. The ringleaders and agitators may be divided into two clearly defined classes. The one includes the men who are energetic and possess, but only intermittently, much strength of will, the other men, far rarer than the preceding, whose strength of will is enduring.9 The first­mentioned are violent and audacious, but their energy, although a force to be reckoned with, is transitory, and scarcely outlasts the exciting cause that has brought it into play. They themselves are led by, and follow as their beacon, a man or an idea. At the upper end of the hierarchy are the second category of leaders of enduring strength of will, the true founders of religious and great undertakings.10 We may well wonder how Le Bon's characterization of \"ring leaders and agitators\" in short­lived volatile heterogeneous crowds fits our information on civilian crowds engaged in ethnic conflict. In the cases I have examined, there are certainly no great charismatic leaders of enduring, stable mass movements and associations at work. What we have are vigorous, violence­prone, patronage­conscious lesser politicians, demagogues (such Page 301 as Cyril Mathews in Sri Lanka and Dr. Ashok Kumar and H. K. L. Bhagat in the Delhi riots), riot captains, and leaders of gangs that employ force on behalf of their patrons, be they politicians, businessmen, or populist or fundamentalist leaders, who rise and fall quickly. In one sense, however, our evidence and analysis goes beyond the framework of Le Bon's elucidation. Although he speaks of types of crowds and offers copious illustrations of crowd behavior from the French Revolution and nineteenth­century French politics (for example, the short­lived popular movement associated with General Boulanger in the later 1880s and mass politics in the Third Republic), Le Bon fails to describe and track in detail a single popular movement and its participants, the faces in the crowd, and the larger political and economic contexts in which these movements rose and fell. In failing to do this, Le Bon also fails to link the crowds he speaks of to the networks of power and politics of their time. The trails I have mapped in my South Asian case studies do link ephemeral riot crowds and their agitators, agents provocateurs, and mobilizers to the less visible, but powerfully present, institutions of and participants in democratic party politics, state machinery, and bureaucratic stakes, and to competition between parties and by ethnic groups among themselves and vis­à­vis the centralizing state and the project of the nation­state. At certain points, the trails lead us to the shadowy depths of the party machineries of Congress (I) in India, the People's Party in Pakistan, and the UNP in Sri Lanka—to mention only some major actors—and their calculations and strategies. Here the shortcomings of Le Bon's political prejudices emerge too. Because he abhorred and feared democracy and socialism, he argued that political institutions, structures, and personnel engaged in the practice of democracy were irrelevant to, and only superficially implicated in, the underlying, enduring, timeless, essentialized, unconscious, and basically racial propensities upon which were projected those processes that create crowds and make our epoch \"the era of crowds.\" I have conversely sought to establish an altogether different thesis, that ethnic strife that generates civilian riots and other crowd phenomena is inseparably linked with the communicational processes and practices of mass politics in the societies I have examined, a thesis that is capable of extension to many other contemporary societies. There is one other limitation to Le Bon's theorizing of the crowd as a general phenomenon in politics. As demonstrated in some of my case studies—especially the Sinhala­Muslim riots of 1915 in Sri Lanka, the Hindu­Sikh riots of Delhi in 1984, and the Karachi riots of the mid 1980s—what Page 302 comes to be labeled a monolithic \"ethnic riot\" is not enacted by a single crowd, but by many crowds, and a number of \"local\" collisions fueled by \"local\" disputes may simultaneously or successively occur and build up by chain reaction and cumulative force into a regional or societywide explosion. The concepts of focalization and transvaluation were used to describe this snowballing process in which particular contextualized happenings progressively lose their local meanings and become assimilated to generalized ethnic and national slogans, claims, and rhetoric. It is because of such internal structuring that we have to remind ourselves constantly that the subjective and interactional crystallizations of the large collectivities who call themselves Sinhalese, Tamils, Sikhs, Hindus, Maharashtrians, and so on are episodic and context­bound. These same collectivities are internally divided and crosscut by factional, sectarian, caste, class, regional, and economic interests, which provide the ground for cleavages and rivalries. This is one reason why ethnic riots that temporarily mobilize large numbers are short­lived. In this way, we should deconstruct the labels, causes, and identities grouped under the general term ethnic conflict, and save this concept from excessive reification. Now if we apply this lesson to Le Bon's treatment of the crowd, we can say that the French Revolution and the political turbulence of the Third Republic should be viewed, not as unitary events enacted in each case by one monolithic, single crowd, but rather as the creations of many crowds, with many faces, fighting different causes and different local enemies, which must also be closely followed and monitored in their chainlike linkages, before we postulate a \"revolution\" as a generalized and unitary phenomenon. The French Revolution, aided by its very labeling, is all too often mistakenly seen as a single coherent movement that fought for the glorious ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity under the charismatic leadership of Danton, Robespierre, and their ilk. Durkheim on the Effervescence and Euphoria of Crowds Emile Durkheim published his epochal work Les Formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse: Le Systàme totémique en Australie in 1912. It was translated into English in 1915 with the title The Elementary Forms of Religious Life: A Study in Religious Sociology. 11 Le Bon's book, The Crowd, had been published in its original French version in 1895. Although Durkheim's work, published some seventeen years later, deals at important points with crowd behavior, he does not cite Le Bon as a relevant text.12 But Page 303 as Steven Lukes observes, in advancing the thesis that certain social situations characterized by collective effervescence generate and recreate religious beliefs and sentiments, Durkheim was doubtless affected by the crop of studies in crowd psychology that had appeared at the end of the nineteenth century, by Scipio Sighela, Gustave Le Bon and, indeed Gabriel Tarde among others, but there is no evidence that he was specifically influenced by any of them; and, unlike them, he did not see crowd behavior as pathological, undesirable and an argument against democracy. On the contrary, he argued that it was \"out of this effervescence itself that the religious idea seems to be born,\" that \"after a collective effervescence men believe themselves transported into an entirely different world from the one they have before their eyes,\" that sacred beings, the creations of collective thought, \"attain their greatest intensity at the moment when the men are assembled together and are in immediate relations with one another, when they partake of the same idea and the same sentiment.\" Moreover, the \"only way of renewing the collective représentations which relate to sacred beings is to retemper them in the very source of the religious life, that is to say, in the assembled groups.\" 13 While Le Bon belongs to the tradition of viewing processes of crowd formation and the actions and sentiments stemming from them as destabilizing, destructive, and degenerative, Durkheim advances the opposite thesis of crowd contexts as positively enabling the generation of \"sacred\" sentiments and of collective representations and practices that produce and celebrate social solidarity and integration. Secondly, insofar as Durkheim sees heightened crowd contexts as generating the sense of the sacred and holy, we may ask to what degree this perspective enables us to appreciate how in the context of ethnic riots, participants accede to the call of violating and victimizing the enemy as a moral imperative, socially induced and legitimated. In other words, Durkheim may have something distinctive to contribute to the subject of how violence relates to the sacred and the religious as collectively experienced and legitimated sentiments. There are many other observations and implications in Durkheim's work that in one way or other bear on the interactional and subjective processes generated when people assemble in crowds to celebrate their religious rites at sacred sites and in other public arenas. Durkheim set out to analyze Australian totemism because he believed that through the analysis of \"the simplest religion known,\" he could determine \"the elementary forms of the religious life.\" He had chosen to study a \"very archaic religion\" \"because it has seemed to us better adapted than any other to an understanding of the religious nature of man, that is to say, to show an essential and permanent aspect of humanity.\"14 This Page 304 stance is, I think, the very opposite of Freud's in both Totem and Taboo and Group Psychology and the Analysis of Ego. Freud, with his evolutionary paradigm and his aligning of the phylogeny of the \"species\" with the \"ontogeny\" of the individual, explained certain \"obsessive\" and \"neurotic\" features of modern man's conduct as a ''regression\" in his unconscious life to \"primordial\" infantile experience and desires. Durkheim's aim was to establish that the study of archaic religion reveals in a clear manner something universal and permanent in all humanity, including the modern man, that derives from the fact of his being a social being. What is the origin of the \"idea of totemic principle or mana\"? The stimulating action of society is felt by us as some current of energy coming from outside us. Moral power, although immanent in us, represents within us something not ourselves, namely, moral conscience. In similar manner, \"we are forced to localize \\[our cultural capital—our language, our treasury of knowledge and traditions\\] outside ourselves,\" since they exercise over us a pressure of which we are conscious. 15 (In modern jargon, Durkheim is discussing parallel processes of objectification.) Collective sentiments themselves propel, constitute, and structure ritualized conduct. In this observation about the collective impulsion toward ritual, Durkheim has an insight that escapes Freud's theory of individual pathological rites being the basis of collective religious rites: \"Since a collective sentiment cannot express itself collectively except on the condition of observing a certain order permitting co­operation and movements in unison, the gestures and cries naturally tend to become rhythmic and regular; hence come songs and dances.\"16 One may add to this insight the suggestion that many situations of mass assembly—ranging from demonstrations, strikes, and public protests to audiences listening to an orator or watching a spectacle—quite easily allow for low­level leaders, cheerleaders, and the like to orchestrate a crowd and make it follow routines of sitting and standing, cheering and jeering, raising and lowering flags and placards, reciting slogans and singing rousing songs. The coupling of rhythmic conduct with social regimentation is a topic worthy of study. Into this aspect of the discussion may also be fitted Durkheim's reference to \"the demon of oratorical inspiration\" as something dialectically generated by the interaction of public speaker and audience. The \"exceptional increase of force\" felt by the speaker \"is something very real; it comes to him from the very group which he addresses. The sentiments provoked by his word come back to him, but enlarged and amplified, and to this degree they strengthen his own sentiment.\"17 In amplification of this, I may add that it is not only in public oratory Page 305 that this intersubjective dialogical stimulation occurs between performer and a participatory audience. We constantly witness a phenomena in sports arenas whereby processes of interstimulation between athletes and cheering fans raise the performance level of the home­team athletes to an even higher level than that achieved in previous moments, which first lit up the fans. A crescendo of noise and a quick flurry of unstoppable plays by the home athletes go hand in hand. The visiting team, consisting of no lesser athletes, is for a while collectively deflated, dispirited, and out of rhythm and seems actually to have lost physical energy, while the home team seems to have acquired a higher energy level, a lift of the spirits, prowess, and skill that in retrospect amazes them. By virtue of the close surrounding presence of spectator fans, basketball produces this demon of athletic inspiration more visibly than other sports, and the so­called \"home court advantage\" applies supremely to that game. I think it is possible to rephrase and extend Durkheim on another matter. One of his central theories in Elementary Forms was that \"sacred things are simply collective ideals that have fixed themselves on material objects.\" He explains their sacredness thus: \"They are collective forces hypostatized, that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the separate spectacle of society, and not from sensations coming from the physical world.\" 18 Aspects of this formulation may fruitfully be aligned with the concept of the \"objectification of charisma\" in statues, images, amulets, relics, and sacred spots that I first developed in Buddhist Saints of the Forest.19 In that book, I discussed how the \"charisma\" of saintly persons is ritually transferred to objects, which are seen as embodying the virtues and energies of the saints and transmit and radiate them to their lay possessors or worshipers, who also in turn treasure them, care for them, and invest those objects with portions of their own biography and personal experiences. I employed the neo­Peircean terms indexical symbols and indexical icons to describe these object­person relations. Durkheim can thus be seen as suggesting that the religious force and energy generated by collective assemblies are externalized and objectified in totems, sacred objects to which are attributed power in their own right. But then in turn, by their very display and presence in collective rites, these objects generate and constitute collective sentiments and cognitions in the human participants. We can see therefore why the embodiments of objectified charisma—national flags, banners, standards, holy books, images, and portraits—are deployed in the collective rites, ceremonies, protests, elections, and processions that I have identified as fundamental to Page 306 ethnic conflict and collective violence, exemplifying the process of \"participation\" elaborated on in my book Magic, Science, Religion and the Scope of Rationality. 20 It is possible to separate analytically at least two orientations to our cosmos, two orderings of reality that people everywhere are capable of experiencing, although the specific mix, weighting, and complementarity between the two may vary among individuals, among groups within a culture, and among cultures taken as collective entities. These two orientations I label participation and causality. Causality is quintessentially represented by the categories, rules, and methodology of positive science and discursive mathematico­logical reason. In ideal terms, the scientific focus is perceived as involving affective neutrality to and abstraction from events in the world. Particularly in the so­called hard, natural sciences, cause and effect in space and time are conceived of in terms of measurable impacts of energy and force, and by the progressive atomization of information, by which entities are progressively broken down from molecules to atoms, and from atoms to subatomic particles, whose interactions then provide the image of causality. Participation can be represented as occurring when persons, groups, animals, places, and natural phenomena are in a relation of contiguity and translate that relation into one of existential immediacy and contact and shared affinities. (In the language of semiotics, humans, on the one hand, and places, objects, and natural phenomena, on the other, are represented as mutually representing one another \"iconically,\" and also as transferring energies and attributes \"indexically.\") Participation among people, places, nature, and objects is manifested when Trobriand Islanders relate their myths of origins in terms of emerging from holes in the ground or being associated with primordial rocks; when the name of a peasant in the Kandyan highlands of Sri Lanka is a lexical string that successively denotes his village of origin (vasagama), the ancestral house in that village (gedera) with which his family was associated, and finally his personal name, fusing location, territory, residence, caste, family status, and ancestry in a single composite identity; when in a present­day Calabrian village, grandparents speak of their ancient rootedness in farms and villages of origin; when Americans, young and old, terrified by nuclear devastation and industrial waste, turn out in droves to protect their environment and their ecology, their flora and their fauna; when the Romantic poets, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley, waxed eloquent in the presence of, and communion with, nature; when national monuments such as the Lincoln and Page 307 Jefferson memorials, graveyards such as the Arlington National Cemetery, and battlefields such as Gettysburg are believed to enshrine a people's history and radiate their national glories. And people participate in each other as well: the bonding and relation between parents and children, between kinsmen by the ties of blood and amity; the transmission of charisma, or metta, through amulets and talismans between a Buddhist saint and his followers, or between Thai royalty and their subjects; the Indian concept of the darshan of a deity, whose eyes fall upon the worshipers as much as the worshipers view their deity—all these are intimations of participation. The connectedness between persons and the sense of being a part of an ensemble of relationships are also bridges to the reality of participation. Although \"causation\" and \"participation\" may seem different or contrastive orientations to the world, the analyst must maintain that both are projected on the experiential and symbolizing capacities of the same sensory modalities of man—the modalities of touch, taste, hearing, and seeing. While much of the discourse of causality and positive science is framed in terms of distancing, neutrality, experimentation, and the language of analytic reason, much of the discourse of participation can be framed in terms of sympathetic immediacy, performative speech acts, and ritual action. If participation emphasizes sensory and affective communication and the language of emotions, causality stresses the rationality of instrumental action and the language of cognition. But these are ideal type exaggerations, and neither can exclude the devices of the other. Durkheim was well aware—and here perhaps he intersects with Le Bon—that the \"effervescence\" created and experienced in crowds could result in \"excesses\" of both a positive and a negative kind. Le Bon the conservative mainly saw the \"negative\" aspects of crowd conduct. Durkheim seems to have been more evenhanded about the creative and destructive aspects of crowd excitation: A \"general effervescence . . . is characteristic of revolutionary or creative epochs,\" he observes. Men become different. The passions moving them are of such an intensity that they cannot be satisfied except by violent and unrestrained actions, actions of superhuman heroism or of bloody barbarism. This is what explains the Crusades, for example, or many of the scenes, either sublime or savage, of the French Revolution. Under the influence of the general exaltation, we see the most mediocre and inoffensive bourgeois become either a hero or a butcher. 21 Indeed, the effervescence and agitation can lead to excesses: it \"often reaches such a point that it causes unheard­of actions. The passions released are of such an impetuosity that they can be restrained by nothing.\" Page 308 Ordinary morals, such as rules governing sexual relations, are contravened. Australian tribal totemic rites, usually staged at night, \"produce such a violent super­ excitation of the whole physical and mental life that it cannot be supported very long: the actor taking the principal part finally falls exhausted on the ground.\" 22 But he has experienced extraordinary powers, which excite him to the point of frenzy. Page 309 12 The Moral Economy of Collective Violence Rites of Violence George Rudé's judgment of the European preindustrial crowds he describes as methodically destroying property and indulging in arson is that they were moved by economic and political \"injustices,\" and that their acts of destruction signified the \"leveling instinct . . . common to all such occasions, which prompts the poor to seek a degree of elementary social justice at the expense of the rich, les grands, and those in authority regardless of whether they are government officials, feudal lords, capitalists, or middle class revolutionary leaders.\" 1 And, as we have seen, Le Bon and Canetti, too, refer to the leveling passions of the crowd. E. P. Thompson's thesis of the \"moral economy\" and Natalie Zemon Davis's perspective on \"rites of violence\" both address the issue of the purposive motivations of preindustrial crowd violence in Europe and the conventional moral parameters within which it was exercised. As Davis puts it, summarizing the cumulative work of historians such as Hobsbawm, Thompson, Rudé, Tilly, and Le Roy Ladurie: The sixteenth century itself had its own generalizations about crowd violence. . . . Most of the time . . . the image was of chaos. Learned writers talk of grain rioters in Lyon as \"the dregs of populace, with no order, no rein, no leader . . . a beast of many heads . . . an insane rabble\" and of the Paris mob as an \"ignorant multitude, . . . governed by the appetite of those who stir them up \\[to\\] extreme rage, just looking for the chance to carry out any kind of cruelty.\" Nowadays, this hydra­headed monster is perceived as having a more orderly shape: We may see these crowds as prompted by political and moral traditions which legitimize and even prescribe their violence. We may see urban rioters not as Page 310 miserable, uprooted, unstable masses, but as men and women who often have some stake in their community; who may be craftsmen or better; and who, even when poor and unskilled, may appear respectable to their everyday neighbors. Finally, we may see violence, however cruel, not as random and limitless, but as aimed at defined targets and selected from a repertory of traditional punishments and forms of destruction. 2 Davis uses the phrase \"rites of violence\" to label the religious riots in sixteenth­century France. \"Is there any way we can order the terrible, concrete details of filth, shame, and torture that are reported from both Protestant and Catholic riots?\" she asks, and answers: \"I would suggest that they can be reduced to a repertory of actions, derived from the Bible, from the liturgy, from the action of political authority, or from the traditions of popular folk practices intended to purify the religious community and humiliate the enemy and thus make him less harmful.\"3 The violence, however cruel, was not random or limitless, Davis suggests, but \"aimed at defined targets and selected from a repertory of traditional punishments and forms of destruction.\"4 Destruction by water and fire purified, exorcised, and removed pollution. Making victims wear crowns of thorns or ride backward on asses had their biblical precedents, now reproduced in mockery. Even the extreme ways of defiling corpses—dragging bodies through the streets and throwing them to the dogs, dismembering genitalia and selling them in mock commerce—and desecrating religious objects—roasting the crucifix, daubing human excrement on holy water basins, greasing one's boots with holy oil—had their perverse connection with concepts of pollution and purification, heresy and blasphemy. From another angle of vision, the rites of violence merge with the realm of comedy and the ebullience of festivities, processions, and Mardi Gras games. Examples are mock trials imitating magistrates' proceedings and the killing of victims as enactments of \"farce.\" Indeed, the occasion for most religious violence was during the time of religious processions and mass rituals. Collisions and confrontations were inevitable when different styles of worship collided in the same public space and during the same sacred time: \"When festive Catholicism took over the streets with dancing, masks, banners, costumes and music, the sober Protestant procession was a parade of armed men and women in their dark clothes, going off to services at their temple or outside the city gates, singing Psalms and spiritual songs that to Catholic ears sounded like insults against the Church and her sacraments.\"5 South Asian riots also give ample evidence of such \"rites of violence\" drawn from the repertory of religious lore and ritual, folk sanctions and Page 311 punishments, and rituals of purification and exorcism. Muslims and Buddhists clashing over processions; Hindus and Muslims fighting about cow killing; May Day rallies and Wesak festivities; inflammatory election speeches and the strident sermons of Buddhist monks at public rituals; collective vow­taking to eliminate the profane enemy in imitation of vows taken before the powerful god Kataragama in his manifestation in the Sinhalese Buddhist pantheon as a guardian of the island, granter of boons, and punisher of enemies—these all powerfully instigate and even legitimate acts of violence (in the eyes of the assailants) \"for the sake of religion and country\": the demonizing of victims and their expulsion or annihilation in the idiom of exorcism; ultimately, the forced immolation of defenseless and terrified victims in mock imitation of both the self­immolation of conscientious objectors and the terminal rite of cremation. Is There a Moral Economy of Ethnic Violence? One critical question we must confront is whether the demonstration that there is ritualized and patterned conduct in ethnic riots that finds its precedents in religious and other ideological lore and beliefs, cultural practices, and social customs automatically legitimates that violence in ethical and moral terms. There is no doubt that the majority of those involved in such violence, be they Hindu or Muslim, Sinhalese or Tamil, Sikh or Hindu, Bengali or Chakma, Pathan or Bihari, feel at some level that their cause is legitimate and justified—and this is why they can by and large live with their violence (although they cannot totally escape doubts and pangs of remorse). But even if it manifests elements describable as \"rites of violence,\" can collective action in ethnic conflict for that reason claim the right to commit violence—violence that violates human rights, equality before law, fair trial, and habeas corpus, and denies the premisses of citizenship, rights to property, and freedom from fear and hunger and injury? Do these rights and criteria, which the United Nations and its agencies declare ought to apply to all humans in our time, supersede the interests, punitive traditions, and extralegal actions of a country's component groups, be they majorities or minorities? Must these groups not bow and bend to the general good of the country, constituted as a democracy, of which they are members? Moreover, how are we to understand \"the right of self­determination\" of peoples as a recognized \"universal right,\" and when are the rights of self­determination of component \"nationalities\" or ''ethnic communities\" in a plural society held to be justified and to take priority over a centralizing authority in the name of nation­state making? Page 312 The concept of moral economy formulated by E.P. Thompson may help us to answer these questions. Thompson argues that eighteenth­century English \"food riots\" constituted \"a pattern of social protest which derives from a consensus as to the moral economy of the commonwealth in times of dearth.\" 6 Rejecting \"the spasmodic view of popular history\" that denigrates the popular protests of that time as the actions of \"mobs,'' a label that denies common people the status of historical agents in their own right, or vulgarizes their actions as merely attempts to stay the rebellions of the belly (a form of gross economic reductionism), Thompson advances this sympathetic portrayal of motive and normative expectations: \"It is possible to detect in every eighteenth century crowd action some legitimating notion,\" the belief of the men and women of the crowd \"that they were defending traditional rights or customs\" and that they \"were supported by the wider consensus of the community.\" \"On occasion this popular consensus was endorsed by some measure of license afforded by the authorities.\" It is true that riots were triggered by soaring prices, by malpractice among dealers, or by hunger, but \"these grievances operated within a popular consensus as to what were legitimate and what were illegitimate practices in marketing, milling, baking, etc.\" This in turn was \"grounded upon a consistent traditional view of social norms and obligations, of the proper economic functions of several parties within the community,\" which can be said to constitute \"the moral economy of the poor.\"7 This moral economy impinged very generally upon eighteenth­century government and thought; it supported definite and passionately held notions of the commonweal, which found some support in the paternalist tradition of the authorities. By a \"paternalistic model of the marketing and manufacturing process,\" Thompson meant regulation by the authorities on behalf of the poorer segments of the populace: markets should be controlled and supervised to protect ordinary consumers: they should conduct sales at stated times and employ accurate weights and measures; the poor should have the opportunity to buy grain, flour, or meal in small parcels without hindrance; and dealers should be hedged around with restrictions against malpractice and profiteering. The authorities should also ideally provide consumer protection; millers and bakers should be considered servants of the community, working not for gross profit but for a fair allowance. The market practices of laissez­faire capitalism were resisted by the poor with decreasing success. The paternalist norms provided exasperated crowds with legitimation for their food riots, although direct action itself through rioting and con­ Page 313 fiscation or destruction of property in an effort to restore fair practices was not sanctioned by the paternalist authorities themselves. The Moral Economy Perspective and the Subaltern Historians The moral economy perspective had its first interesting, and, in the eyes of many readers, persuasive Asian application in James Scott's The Moral Economy of the Peasant (1976), 8 in which he interpreted certain peasant rebellions in Burma and Indo­China in twentieth­century colonial times as motivated by peasant grievances against breaches of traditional understandings in landlord­tenant relations, especially with regard to the guarantee of subsistence security in times of poor harvests and uncertain prices. The erosion of these norms in an expanding market economy with monetized rents, which were not adjusted to cushion poor seasons, and inflationary prices fueled peasant insurrections such as the Saya San rebellion in Burma. With regard to India, the moral economy interpretation has been invoked as a guiding principle in the reconstruction of Indian colonial history by some historians of the subaltern school. A case in point is Gyanendra Pandey's treatment of the peasant revolt and riots in Awadh, North India, in January 1921.9 Pandey writes: The idea of a just, or moral, struggle appears to have been fundamental to the peasants' acceptance of the necessity of revolt. Exploitation as such was not unjust. It was inevitable that some ruled and some conducted prayers and some owned the land and some labored and all lived off the fruits of that labor. But it was important that everyone in the society made a living out of the resources that were available. . . . It was . . . when the landlord decided to levy new and oppressive imposts in a period of considerable hardship for substantial sections of the peasantry that resistance was taken up in Awadh as morally right and necessary.10 The peasant rebellion in Awadh studied by Pandey diverges from the pattern of most of the short­lived South Asian ethnic riots sketched in Part I of this book, in that it lasted some three years, from 1919 to 1922. Pandey's essay is thus more comparable with the discussion in chapter 9 above of Hindu nationalism and the Ayodhya dispute, a series of campaigns and contests that have occurred over a number of years and are still continuing. Pandey's account is structured in terms of three phases. The first lasted until about the end of 1920, when the peasants were forming associations Page 314 and in the main making protests against the excessive exactions of the landlords. The second was a militant phase from January 1921 onwards, when peasants rioted against and attacked landlords and merchants and their agents and properties, there were engagements between peasants and the police, and trials of the offenders were subsequently held by panchayats (village or local councils). The last phase erupted after a brief period of quiescence, toward the end of November 1921, in the form of the Eka (unity) campaign. This consisted of many Eka meetings, attracting hundreds of people and lasting a few days. The whole peasant movement, however, soon went under, being unable further to resist the police. A reason suggested for this outcome is that Indian National Congress politicians on the whole failed to support the movement, thereby preventing it from becoming more general and widespread. This in turn may also have contributed to the peasant movement's inability to sustain itself against the government's security forces. Although he does not explicitly postulate a system of moral economy norms applicable to the society of Awadh at large, of which the rural population was a part, as Thompson does for England, or that orientated landlord­tenant relations, minimizing the risks of going under and of starvation for the peasants, as Scott does for Burma, Pandey convincingly demonstrates that the \"inferior right holders\" in land and tenant peasantry and laborers, already subject in the late nineteenth century to heavy taxations and exactions, suffered even more excessive, illegal, and \"unjust\" exactions and expulsions at the hands of their landlords in the years of depression and inflation following World War I. The peasants of Awadh, by this persuasive account, were justified in their revolt, for they had genuine grievances. And when the peasants, organized as collectivities, were moved to militant action in 1920–21, they assembled in large numbers and \"rioted\" in unison in many parts of Awadh. For example, in the Rae Bareli, Faizabad, and Sultanpur districts, peasant violence took the forms of \"the looting of bazaars, attacks on landlords, and battles with the police.\" There were several instances of attacks on landlords' property: In Rae Bareli large bands appeared in several estates, destroying the taluqdars' crops and looting and destroying storage places. \"From 5 January for some days the district was in a state of anarchy.\" . . . In Faizabad the terminal weeks of 1920 and the early days of 1921 brought isolated attacks on the servants of taluqdars, and the looting and the burning of their straw. Then following a meeting on 12 January 1921 which led to an attack and the looting of Zamindars of Dankara, widespread rioting broke out in the district. Bands of Page 315 11 500–1000 men, women and children marched from place to place for the next two days, settling scores with their enemies. In the forefront of the riots, Pandey says, were \"the lower castes and landless labourers\" and members of \"'criminal' tribes,\" lower­caste Ahirs, Bhars, Lunias, and the untouchable Pasis and Chamars, \"the castes that provided the majority of the small tenants and agricultural labourers.\" It is noteworthy that after the initial attacks on the landlords, their agents and servants, and the houses and properties of \"high­caste villagers,\" the actions of the rioters after December 1920 were \"extended to the bazaars and other points where wealth was concentrated. The chief targets were the banias (merchants) who had exploited the difficult times to make large profits, but sunars (goldsmiths), weavers, and others who were thought to have profited from the situation were also attacked in some places. The houses of upper caste and prosperous villagers were attacked, and quantities of clothes, jewels and so on burnt and destroyed.\"12 Pandey is unequivocal about the purposiveness and motivation of the riots: the peasants organized for action in peasant associations; they were motivated by just grievances and inspired by consciousness of their condition; they mobilized effectively to hold meetings and protests; they pledged to resist oppression by landlords. Although Pandey does interestingly, if all too briefly, refer to the energizing role of rumors (about the alleged multiple simultaneous appearances of the national charismatic Gandhi and the local charismatic Ramachandra in many places) and the mystical potency of slogans such as \"Sita­Ram\" for the mobilization of crowds, when the people were moved to riot, he does not entertain any possibility of crowds qua crowds under heightened circumstances engaging in collective violence— arson, looting, plunder—that may require probing beyond the normative limits of a moral economy paradigm. Indeed, at one point, he dismisses another contemporary historian's view thus: \"\\[M. H.\\] Siddiqi seems to accept the contemporary officials' view that the peasants were 'indiscriminate' in their attacks, and describes the local Sabhas as becoming 'totally anarchic' at the level of action. Yet the weight of the evidence points to a quite different conclusion.\"13 In my view, Pandey's demonstration of the grievances behind the peasant revolt in Awadh, and of the peasants' capacity to organize politically in their own right (without the ambiguous and equivocal help of the national Congress politicians) and their transition to militant action, is illuminating and persuasive. It certainly reinforces Ranajit Guha's charge about \"the Page 316 myth, retailed so often by careless and impressionistic writing on the subject of peasant insurrections being purely spontaneous and unpremeditated affairs.\" 14 The jacqueries in the Allahabad and Ghazipur districts during the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857–58 and revolts such as those launched by the Kol (1832) and the Santal and the Munda (1899–1900), Guha says, \"had all been inaugurated by planned and in some cases protracted consultation among the representatives of the local peasant masses. . . . They had far too much at stake and would not launch into it except as a deliberate, even if desperate, way out of an intolerable condition of existence. Insurgency, in other words, was a motivated and conscious undertaking on the part of the rural masses.\"15 In much of the earlier historiography, he asserts, however, \"insurgency is regarded as external to the peasants' consciousness.\"16 While accepting without demur a high content of purposiveness and planned action in the peasant revolt in Awadh, as demonstrated by Pandey, I think there is still some space left for asking how exhaustive that framework is (1) for dealing with the question of the representativeness of the peasant rebels with regard to the stratum they belonged to—that is, the issue of internal differentiation and conflict of interests among the varied peasantry itself, and (2) for fully accounting for the shape and intensity of the violent acts enacted by the peasant crowds themselves. The first issue has been addressed by C.A. Bayly in his assessment of \"the subaltern project.\" With regard to the relative propensity of peasants to violent protest, a theme that runs throughout the volumes of Subaltern Studies, Bayly remarks: Even at the height of these spectacular disturbances only a minority of villagers were involved in prolonged violent disturbance. . . . Again, at the height of the Depression and no­rent movements in 1931 a remarkably high proportion of peasants still paid up. It is not at all clear that resistance, let alone violence, is a defining characteristic of the poor or exploited. This may be an unfortunate fact, but it is not one that historians can ignore. What emerges from this is that a critical analysis of rural movements (and for that matter, working class movements) will be flawed if it fails to take into account the sectionalism of workers and peasants. The investment of the Congress in defence of the social status quo was paralleled by the concern of high and middle peasant groups for property, status and dominance, however poverty stricken they were in reality. . . . Down almost to the very bottom of society every subaltern was an elite to someone lower than him . . . , the rhetorical devices of \"subaltern\" and \"peasant resistance\" often impede \\[the subaltern historians\\] in this more subtle analysis.17 Bayly suggests that \"the rural movement fell apart under the weight of its own internal conflicts and that propertied elements within the peasantry Page 317 as much as the small landed class took a hand in suppressing the movement.\" 18 The second issue arises out of the instances of ethnic riots represented in this book, all except one of which have occurred in postcolonial times. Two interrelated comments are in order. While there is considerable evidence for the purposiveness and directedness of the riots once they got under way, I have also tried to suggest that the communicational and interpersonal processes recursively and cumulatively at work in crowd situations may generate heightened violence that goes beyond premeditation and purposive political action. Moreover, the riots we have studied are not simply a monolithic contest between the \"state\" or \"government\" and the \"people.\" There are many scenarios. Sometimes, as in Colombo in 1983 and Delhi in 1984, some government representatives and resources were clearly for a while involved in the production and direction of the riots. All too often it is a majority ethnonationalist community—as in the case of the aforementioned Colombo and Delhi riots, and in the case of the string of urban riots after the demolition of the Babri mosque in 1992, of which Bombay was the exemplary worst instance—that launches violence against a minority and is aided and given space to do so by the agents of law and order of the city or state, particularly the police. Sometimes as in the Pathan­Bihari riots in Karachi, a section of the civilian populace engages with another section, and the security forces of the state may have to intervene (it may be hoped as a neutral arm) to stop the violence. These are not necessarily separate scenarios—they could variably combine in ethnonationalist conflicts. Finally, we should not forget that sections of the civilian populace may collide, both with the aid of state agents whose loyalties are divided and against the representatives of the state taking part in the conflict. These are complexities that no contemporary witness of ethnic conflicts can forget or mute. There is no monolithic archenemy called ''colonialism\" available to be excoriated; and one cannot romanticize contemporary South Asian ethnic riots as pure \"resistance\" and the attendant acts of arson, homicide, and injury as commensurate with a \"conscious undertaking\" on the part of the rioters. A Subaltern Historian Looks at India's Contemporary Sectarian Strife Gyanendra Pandey himself has recently written a study of Hindu­Muslim riots in India, showing how a subaltern historian constructs his own narra­ Page 318 tive about, and represents as well as evaluates, acts of collective violence enacted in India's contemporary sectarian and ethnic strife. 19 Consonant with a postmodern stance, Pandey is critical of any attempt to write a grand and totalizing, even objective, history of sectarian strife. A discourse in \"search for omniscience\" is out of place. He also associates such attempts with a particular historiographic perspective, the view from the center, which is also the view of an elite sectional interest. This view accords \"the rhetoric of nationalism a central place, and interprets nation state making as the mainstream historical process,\" and therefore treats all opposition to the nation­state as antinational, \"whether this opposition has been located in the industrial working class, among the rural poor, or in other regional and local movements.\" This narrow nationalist perspective ''is bolstered not only by reference to current world trends in the economic and political practice of states . . . but also by a 'modern' and avowedly secular nationalist historiography that has reinforced notions of natural Indian unity and an Indian national essence.\"20 Pandey, in riposte to this historiography elevating the nation­state, advocates his own reading \"in defence of the fragments.\" The word fragments is rhetorically deployed in several ways. On the one hand, it refers to \"the fragments of Indian society—the smaller religious and caste communities, tribal sections, industrialist workers, activist women's groups, all of which might be said to represent minority 'cultures and practices' that are expected to fall in line with the 'mainstream' national culture (Brahmanical Hindu, consumerist, and sectional).\" Fragments \"also designates the hazardous variety of the evidence a historian of modern strife has to deal with\" and \"the difficulties of evidence gathering and representation encountered,\" which point to \"the folly of using accounts of, say fifty or a hundred years ago as if they were somehow 'transparent,' and capable by balanced setting off against one another, by appropriate additions and subtractions, to give an adequate reconstruction of history.\" While nationalist Indian history finds its primary source in official archives (government records, court records), Pandey urges historians to use another kind of \"fragment\"—a weaver's diary, a collection of poems by an unknown poet, and those literatures that Macaulay condemned: creation myths and women's songs, family genealogies and local traditions of history. (One forgives him for failing to say that this is the stuff out of which social and cultural anthropologists of South Asia have constructed their monographs for decades.) These fragments might well, and do, challenge the state's construction of history and mark \"those contested spaces Page 319 through which particular unities are sought to be constituted and others broken up.\" 21 Now, as a sympathetic reader of Pandey's essay, I see him positioning himself in this way to advance his own \"'fragmentary' point of view,\" which foregrounds the deeply contested nature of the territory of Indian nationalism and resists \"the drive for a shallow homogenization and struggles for older, potentially richer definitions of the 'nation' and the future political community.\"22 Pandey decries the discourse that has represented sectarian strife in India, labeled \"communalism,\" as a secondary story to the nationalist discourse, and has reduced Hindu­Muslim strife to a minor element in the main drama of India's struggle for independence from colonial rule. \"Partition was, for the majority of people living in what are now the divided territories of northern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, the event of the twentieth century—equivalent in terms of trauma and consequence to the First World War (the \"Great War\") for Britain or the Second World War for France and Japan,\" Pandey asserts.23 A few exceptions aside, most Indian intellectuals, Pandey complains, \"have tended to celebrate the story of the Independence struggle rather than dwell on the agonies of Partition.\"24 Differences and strife between Hindus and Muslims persist in India today, Pandey points out, and, while there are reasons for wanting to suppress or to evade representing this state of affairs, investigators and writers should deal with the Muslim­Hindu polarizing stereotypes that are generated by it, and also deal with the issue of violence itself, not push it aside as an aberration or an extraordinary phenomenon, or in the opposite direction as a ''known\" matter. (Having myself devoted much time recently to studying collective violence as a critical inquiry, I cannot but feel gratified by this view.) Pandey's own characterization of Hindu­Muslim sectarian strife and violence is partly based on, and was triggered by, his visit, as a member of a ten­member team sent under the aegis of the People's Union of Democratic Rights (PUDR), Delhi, to investigate the Hindu­Muslim riots that took place in Bhagalpur in October– November 1989. Before sketching his impressions, Pandey signals the problems with collecting factual \"evidence,\" dealing with informants' partial and tendentious reports, including their \"preemptive narratives\" and \"ritualized accounts,\" and the willful destruction or erasure of both \"official\" and unofficial evidence—in short, the problem of using \"fragments\" of information in writing a history. Hence his defensive opening statement, \"This is not a paper,\" and his play Page 320 on the multiple meanings of fragments. But carefully read, Pandey's essay, despite its disavowals and equivocations, and agonizings over difficulties, does at crucial points make unqualified general observations and judgments on the shape and contours of contemporary sectarian strife: It has become commonplace in India now to describe one instance of strife after another as \"perhaps the worst since 1947\"; such has been the magnitude and brutality of sectarian violence in the 1980s. In any event, Bhagalpur was indeed one of the most devastating examples of Hindu­Muslim strife in the country since Partition. This round of violence began in the last week of October 1989; arson, looting, and murder spread from the city to the surrounding countryside and raged practically unchecked for several days. The situation was then brought under some sort of control by military and paramilitary forces, but an atmosphere of fear and terror remained for months afterwards. Given the scale of the \"riots,\" and the infamous role of the local administration in encouraging the attacks and suppressing evidence, it is impossible to establish the \"facts\" of this occurrence—what traditional historians like to call the \"nuts and bolts\" of the story. Possibly as many as a thousand people were killed in the course of the violence, most of them Muslims, but estimates of the casualties still vary enormously. During the first days of the \"riots,'' trains were stopped repeatedly at different places in Bhagalpur and its neighboring districts; from several of these, Muslim travelers were dragged out and lynched. No one can say for certain how many were killed in this way—not even disturbed Hindu travelers who happened to be caught on one of these trains and saw people being pulled from their particular carriage. In the major attacks, in the rural areas as well as in the city, neither old people nor infants, neither women nor children, were spared. There is widespread feeling that women were abducted and raped on a large scale, but none of the surviving victims will talk about rape; the five specific cases recorded by the PUDR team that conducted investigations in Bhagalpur in January 1990 were incidents that Muslim women informants had themselves heard about. What is beyond question is that the extent and ferocity of the attacks were unprecedented, even for a district that has seen much sectarian strife before, including \"riots\" in 1946. At the worst stage of the violence in October–November 1989, some 40,000 people were forced to leave their homes and live in makeshift relief camps. Destruction and looting of property occurred on a massive scale for several weeks. The fears generated among the heavily outnumbered Muslims were such that a great many were unwilling to return to their homes even three months after the initial outbreak of violence; an estimated 10,000 were still in \"relief camps\" toward the end of January 1990, apart from those who had moved in with relatives or friends in \"safer\" places in or outside Bhagalpur district. At this time many Muslims were pressing for the permanent retention of military or paramilitary forces in the vicinity of their villages or wards (mohallas) as the only trustworthy means for their protection, and some were demanding that they be given arms by the Page 321 government for the same purpose. The air was still thick with rumors, and isolated attacks and looting continued to occur; one such incident was reported as late as March 1990. 25 These statements, strong reminders of many features I have already sketched and discussed in regard to my case studies in Part I, unequivocally convey one message: that contemporary ethnic conflicts can scarcely unproblematically be represented in terms of \"subaltern resistance\" and \"justifiable premeditation.\" In fact, Pandey ventures the judgment that contemporary ethnic conflict and collective violence have intensified in scale and taken forms little known in the past: Sectarian violence in the 1980s appears to have taken on new and increasingly horrifying forms. Recent strife between people belonging to different religious denominations has not been restricted to pitched battles on the streets or cloak­and­dagger attacks and murders in side lanes, which were the chief markers of earlier riots. The worst instances of recent violence—Bhagalpur, 1989; Meerut, 1987; the anti­Sikh \"riots\" in Delhi in 1984; the anti­Tamil \"riots\" in Colombo in 1983; the Hindu­Muslim \"riots\" in Moradabad in 1980; and others—have amounted to pogroms, organized massacres in which large crowds of hundreds, thousands, and even, in places, tens of thousands have attacked the houses and property and lives of small, isolated, and previously identified members of the \"other\" community.26 The \"excesses\" of Hindu nationalism generated in the modern political context are set out with a fierce moral outrage and a sense of \"evil\" unleashed: Many observers have pointed to the new heights reached by Hindu militancy and propaganda over the last few years. This has been orchestrated most visibly by the VHP, and it plainly had much to do with the increased frequency and scale of Hindu­Muslim strife in the 1980s. The point that is perhaps not sufficiently stressed, however, is that the violent slogans and demands of organizations like the VHP, and the \"riots\" they have sparked, do not poison the minds of \"the people\" only for a moment. On the contrary—given our history, the resources available to \"secular\" and \"communal\" forces in the country, the opportunism of most of our major political parties, and the continued and repeated outbreak of sectarian violence—the most outrageous suggestions about the \"evil,'' \"dangerous,\" \"threatening\" character of the \"other\" community (or communities) come to be widely accepted and part of a popular dogma. Nothing but this acceptance can explain the kinds of atrocities perpetrated in recent instances of sectarian strife: the call to leave not a single Muslim man, woman, or child alive, which was acted upon in several places in Bhagalpur; the massacre of all eighteen Muslim passengers traveling in a tempo­taxi along with the Hindu taxi driver, when they were stopped on a major country road two­and­a­half weeks after the cessation of general Page 322 \"rioting,\" and their burial in a field which was then planted over with garlic; the chopping off of the breasts of women; the spearing of infants and children, the spears with the victims impaled on them being then twirled around in the air to the accompaniment of laughter and shouts of triumph. 27 The Moral Economy Argument and Modern South Asian Ethnic Violence Can the modern South Asian ethnic conflicts and riots that I have been describing be defended and legitimated as popular expressions of a moral economy grounded in a broad consensus spelled out by the authority of the nation­state and generally accepted by its citizens? Can the sort of argument E. P. Thompson provided for the eighteenth­century grain riots in England and that Pandey has advanced for the Awadh peasant revolt of the early 1920s also be sustained here? The short answer is, no. Modern South Asian ethnic conflicts take place in an environment that lacks a crystallized and coherent nation­state ideology and a body of political norms and practices deriving from it that is acceptable to and shared by all (or the majority of) the components and members of the body politic. That there is a crisis of the nation­state in South Asia today is patently clear. True, the contending parties appeal to norms, traditions, and values that in their eyes grant legitimacy to their causes. But they are particularistic claims and divide the proponents into protagonists and antagonists in an arena that lacks a consensual unitary \"moral political economy\" that is an organic growth deriving from historical developments in late colonial and in postindependence times and claims the allegiance of all peoples in the country. The concept of moral economy is only applicable to a situation where the contending parties refer and defer to a shared discourse of values and practices, although each party may try to interpret and apply those values to its advantage. It cannot apply to a situation where the rivals appeal to different norms and make mutually exclusive claims. The English food riots, although not directly condoned by the state, derived their moral sense and justification from expectations of a fair division of labor in society and how its parts contributed and should contribute to the common wealth. The ethnic turmoils of our time derive from exclusive claims to resources and rewards by the component groups in plural societies; they revolve around \"majoritarian democracy\" and the rights of \"minorities\" and employ inflammatory and divisive labels and slogans such as \"national identity,\" ''mother tongue,\" \"restoration of historical claims,\" Page 323 \"discrimination,\" \"unfair domination,\" \"affirmative action,\" ''equality of citizenship,\" \"the protection of civil rights,\" \"traditional homelands,\" \"majority rule,\" \"minority rights,\" \"self­determination\", \"ethnic cleansing,\" and \"genocide.\" The violence that has occurred and the brutalities that have been practiced are intolerable by the standards of the International Bill of Human Rights, which all member states of the United Nations are urged to accept. Such violence is up to a point \"purposive,\" \"ritualized,\" and \"repetitive,\" draws its shape from a repertory of practices widespread in the society at large, and can be recursively related to the sectional claims, identities, interests, and politics of the segments and communities and individuals that make up the society at large. It is therefore not merely an aberration, or an uncharacteristic phase of \"irrationality,\" but has increasingly become a regularized mode of enacting mass politics and a central experience in the defining self­ perception of collectivities and their expectations of social intercourse. There might still be a case for hopefully asserting that pluralism and multiculturalism (and not a hegemonic national culture sponsored by the population segments that control the nation­state) are the true \"moral economy\" of countries such as India. It is possible to affirm that there are many precedents for coexistence, exchanges, reciprocities, and tolerance between religious, ethnic, and regional groups and collectivities in South Asia, although ethnonationalist movements such as the BJP, VHP, and RSS in India, Dravidian (and Tamil) ethnonationalism in South India, the Jama at­i­Islami in Pakistan, and Sinhala Buddhist nationalism and the Tamil martial nationalism propagated by the LTTE in Sri Lanka are trenchantly nonaccommodative and urge exclusivist boundaries and loyalties and inferiorizing encompassment of minorities. Human Rights Against Oppression The concept of \"human rights\" may be understood as the set of rights articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a statement of principles proclaimed by the United Nations in 1948, and in related international treaties. These treaties include the two international human rights covenants that the United Nations adopted in 1966 and that give legal form to the Universal Declaration. The Covenant of Civil and Political Rights guarantees rights such as freedom of thought and expression, freedom from arbitrary arrest and torture, and freedom of movement and peaceful assembly. The Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provides Page 324 for rights such as the right to work and receive fair wages, to protection of the family, to adequate standards of living, and to education and health care. Together, the Universal Declaration and the international Covenants with the Optional Protocols are known as \"The International Bill of Rights.\" Numerous subsequent treaties elaborate aspects of this Bill of Rights, including covenants on: Prevention and Punishment of Genocide (adopted in 1948), Elimination of Racial Discrimination (1965), Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (1979), the Status of Refugees (1951) and Protocol on Refugees (1966), Rights of Children (1989), Elimination of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief (1981), \\[and the\\] Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (1993) which awaits submission to the UN Commission on Human Rights. 28 It is clear that the International Bill of Human Rights, taken to include all of the above, enumerates many principles and rights that have been violated, ignored, or compromised in current ethnonationalist conflicts all over the world, including those that have occurred and are taking place in South Asia. It is only nations that have ratified the UN covenants and other human rights treaties that are legally bound to observe treaty provisions, and it is the responsibility of the international community to hold governments accountable for their treaty obligations. Not all the members of the United Nations have ratified the Bill of Rights, and the grounds on which they have refused to do so are instructive to consider. Those nations that have ratified the covenants and treaties have conformed with their obligations to varying degrees. One criticism leveled at the Western nations who represent themselves as the primary sources and backers of the concept of universal human rights, including the United States, is that they have not observed or implemented the norms themselves, especially in relation to women, minorities and foreign migrants, \"indigenous peoples,\" the poor, and the \"underclass.\" The Western \"gate keepers\" are also criticized for applying the norms to other nations based on which are their allies and which their enemies, which favorable to their interests and which not. This accusation is irrefutable. But it must be admitted that the most glaring failures in protecting basic rights by countries that have ratified the Bill of Human Rights are found outside Western Europe and North America. In this category must be included the countries of South Asia that are the focus of this book. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and various other NGO's have published findings on state­inflicted abuses, including incarceration without trial, homicide, torture, and displacement of people in India, Pakistan, Sri Page 325 Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Reports by government­appointed commissions, private civilian commissions, NGO's, and a host of civilian sources attest to violence and human rights abuses by citizens against citizens (with or without the participation of the security forces and police) during and after elections, and during riots, rebellions, protests, and strikes. Violations of the rights of women and children in South Asia are plentiful. India has been the scene of highly publicized \"dowry burnings\" of newly married women whose parents allegedly failed to provide adequate dowries to the bridegroom's side. Also much debated are the rights and wrongs of sati (immolation of widows); of allowing Muslims to continue to observe their \"personal laws,\" which include the unilateral privilege of husbands to divorce their wives and avoid making adequate maintenance payments; and of the practices of female infanticide, child labor, child marriage, sale of children, and so on. A vexed question in India today is the question of devising a single uniform civil code for all of India's citizens despite their multicultural and plural religious affiliations. In Pakistan, major human rights issues revolve around religious \"orthodoxy\" and tolerance of sectarian differences within Islam; implementing punishments allegedly authorized by the Qur an and shari ah that seem extreme by United Nations standards; and circumscribing the freedom of women with respect to public employment, forms of dress, movement outside the home, and so on. Sri Lanka's infringements of human rights in regard to the conduct of democratic elections, the state's use of violence and armed force to suppress insurgencies mounted by elements of the Tamil minority and by the Sinhala youth (JVP), and the similar abuses and violations by both Tamil and Sinhalese insurgents, and by civilians who launch \"riots\" against minorities, have been quite well documented and are public knowledge. Violence as a mode of conducting politics is a fact of life in South Asia. The legitimacy of the employment of violence by states and civilian groups and the right of civilian groups and citizens to be protected against that violence are two sides of the same coin. All the South Asian states named here are signatories of the International Bill of Rights. Their official recognition of these rights thus coexists with their infringement of them, official denial of deviations, and testy remarks about undue interference with their national sovereignty if the subject is mentioned. Some nations have refrained from ratifying (in full or part) the International Bill of Rights—China is a major instance of refusal—because such an instrument contravenes \"national sovereignty,\" or, after having signed on paper, continue to have reservations about the provenance and validity Page 326 of the rights in question. It is asserted that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the subsequent elaborations, while claiming to be of universal significance and application, are really products of post­Enlightenment Western perspectives, value orientations, cultural preferences, and historical experiences, and that dressing them up and presenting them as of universal validity violates the experiences, insights, and valuations of non­Western cultural traditions and norms. It is also held that these Western human rights charters are imperialist and hegemonic. There is a widespread perception that the present normative notion of universal human rights is in tension with the moral and cultural diversity in the world. We are thus faced with the apparent incompatibility of the two conceptions: the universality of human rights, on the one hand, and the relativity in human rights, on the other. Notwithstanding significant contributions by non­Western countries to the formulation of human rights covenants and treaties in the nearly fifty years since the Universal Declaration was adopted, and plausible claims by some interpreters of non­Western systems of thought that strands of their traditions independently parallel post­ Enlightenment Western perspectives, it is undeniable that the package is primarily based on Western ideals. However, pressures to allow culture­based deviations from international human rights norms have grown. \"These pressures recently culminated, for example, in efforts by many Asian and Muslim states at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna to challenge the universality of human rights principles as they are currently set out in international law and to seek modification of these principles on the grounds that they are too ethnocentrically Western.\" 29 The final conference declaration appears to paper over the discussions voiced during the proceedings; it ambiguously proclaims that while human rights are universal in nature, regional differences, as well as historical, cultural, and religious backgrounds, should be taken into account. To quote two key resolutions in illustration: The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms the solemn commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments relating to human rights, and international law. The universal nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond question. All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. The international community must treat humans globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis. While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the Page 327 30 duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is not my intention to evaluate human rights from the perspective of universalism versus relativism. A social and cultural anthropologist of my sort will necessarily advocate that a collectivity's cultural practices are historically rooted, that they are interrelated and cannot easily be atomized or fragmented, that their meaningfulness is context­bound and instantiated in action, and that translation from one culture to another requires much care. Some of the comparativists on both sides, universalists and relativists, have unduly totalized and essentialized cultures and civilizations as unified, monolithic entities. Many commentators, advocates, and activists respond to such \"orientalism\" by countering that their religious and cultural texts and normative traditions are many­ stranded and rich, and are capable of, and invite, flexible interpretations. Of all contemporary civilizations, it is the Islamic ones that have been most subject to this stereotyping, both at the hands of Western orientalizers and at the hands of certain authoritarian state powers, who have tried to impose allegedly \"orthodox\" repressive regimes in the name of Islam as officially interpreted. But increasingly there have been critical voices from within Islamic societies that resist monolithic judgments of both kinds. Aside from a few clerics and scholars, the most powerful resistance to negative stereotyping and patriarchal authority comes from feminist groups and women's organizations in these societies. There is more actual diversity of opinions among Muslims on human rights issues than is generally supposed, and Muslims who reject the received orthodoxy are not to be dismissed as alienated from their traditions but are deeply embedded in them. Two general observations hold in any case. First, the positions of the universalists and the cultural relativists are not mutually exclusive and incompatible. There is some shared space between them, without which their discourses would be incommensurable. There are some human rights set forth in international law that remain uncontested by those who call for the recognition of cultural differences. \"These rights include freedom from torture, slavery, genocide, and racial discrimination; the requirements of fair trial; and respect for the dignity of the human person\" (that persons, groups, or states that cannot publicly contest these normative priorities may deviate from them in practice is another matter). However, between universalists and relativists, \"certain other human rights norms, even if contested, must be presupposed for any Page 328 legitimate dialogue to take place.\" The rights in question are the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of association. \"To allow the undermining of rights such as these would be to curb, if not eliminate precisely the freedoms that are needed to carry out meaningful dialogue on human rights and to seriously impede the project of more firmly establishing cultural foundations for a global human rights system. Affirming these human rights norms, even while distinguishing uncontested from contested norms, comprises a fundamental floor of moral agreement that permits constructive dialogue to take place.\" 31 Second, there are many regimes allegedly committed to \"democratic politics\" that have nevertheless, in the name of \"national sovereignty,\" the \"rightful claims of majority\" and \"sons of the soil,\" ''national emergency,\" \"the requirements of economic development and growth,\" \"the imperatives of religious orthodoxy,\" and so on, curbed freedom of the press and freedom of association; practiced religious intolerance (disallowing sectarian differences) and discrimination (preferential policies); imprisoned people, denied them fair trials, and resorted to torture, allegedly to prevent terrorism and \"subversion of state\"; restricted the dress of women and their rights to work and to travel freely. But one lesson above all has been taught us moderns: where there is systematic oppression and violence by the state and by ruling groups, dissent, resistance, and counteraction by the victims usually arise in time. The official voices of the state or ruling groups try to deflect attention away from their abuses and to deny the legitimacy of the voices of the oppressed, be they women's groups, minorities, or inferiorized \"indigenous peoples,\" but collective mobilization in the arenas of modern politics is possible, and counteraction is frequently violent. Coping with Collective Violence It has been demonstrated that democratic politics and ethnonationalist conflicts are related in South Asia, and that violence as a mode of conducting politics has become established, even institutionalized. One might even go so far as to say that ethnonationalist conflicts combined with collective violence are not just isolated volcanic eruptions but are close to becoming systematized social formations. The evidence for the ritualized and routinized forms of conduct that comprise a repertoire of collective violence supports this assertion. In South Asia (and in many other places as well), violence is an integral part of the political process. Page 329 The traditional response of first world criminal justice systems to violent crime is not applicable to the kind of collective violence discussed in this book, and especially civilian ethnonationalist riots. In the United States, we are told, the criminal justice system takes the view that violent crimes (physical and mental injury inflicted on victims) \"are morally wrong as well as simply harmful, and that those who commit such offenses should be held accountable for their misconduct. In this view, justice demands judgement and punishment for such acts, regardless of the practical effect of punishment on future criminal offending.\" 32 It is clear, however, that in South Asian riots of the kind discussed above, violence (in part at least planned and directed) is committed by large \"impersonal\" crowds and frequently acquiesced in by significant segments of the police force (who collude in the violence or passively watch it). In these circumstances, it is virtually impossible, or made impossible, to arrest offenders or expect offenders to be arrested. If arrests are made, they are simply token acts, and the offenders are soon released. (Usually police and paramilitary punitive action against rioting is directed at the victimized minority rather than the aggressor majority.) The net result is that usually there is no prosecution of rioters in the criminal courts. Even more significant, parts of the state system itself—in the form of prominent legislators, members of the security forces, and civil servants at both central and provincial/state levels—are directly or indirectly involved in the staging of such riots, in the belief that they are justified by a need to punish \"dissenting,\" \"disloyal\" minorities and to eliminate imagined disparities between an ''endangered,\" majority and a \"privileged\" minority. This is the logic of leveling crowds engaged in affirmative action on behalf of a majority that feels, or is made to feel, beleaguered. In the criminal justice perspective, the institutions of justice, of law and order, and the officials employed by them are considered guardians and enforcers of rules and norms that are considered legitimate for the entire society. This can hardly be the definition of the situation when members of the legislature and administration are themselves involved in the enactment of collective violence for political purposes. If a criminal justice perspective is inapplicable, the public health system is highly relevant with respect to the consequences of collective violence. The civil administration necessarily has to cope with the damage done during civil disorders. Hospitals and welfare agencies have to deal with the victims of violence who have suffered physical and mental injury, who have been rendered homeless, and have been reduced to the status of refugees and displaced persons. Refugee camps have to be established, relief admin­ Page 330 istered, and compensation for injury provided to widows, care given to orphans, money distributed to enable people to resume their former occupations, and so on. The costs of collective violence—which are immense and sudden—are borne (1) by the official administration of the state and its agencies, which are already financially strained; (2) by citizens who have lost property, houses, businesses, shops, and industries to looting and arson (in most cases in South Asia, comprehensive insurance is not available or feasible); and (3) by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), UN agencies, and foreign aid. An Internal Contradiction Systematically organized ethnic riots of the kind described involve a massive internal contradiction at the level of the state and the government. On the one hand, one or more branches of government—politicians and political parties, and, more indirectly, some of the agents of law and order—are frequently involved in stirring up and managing such riots. On the other hand, other branches and agencies of government are involved in the work of repairing the damage done, however imperfectly, and in spending government resources on rehabilitation and relief. A partial, but by no means insignificant, part of the answer to this contradiction is that it is in the nature of democratic politics as presently practiced in South Asia that political parties are oriented first and foremost to winning the votes of constituents by whatever means. Since ethnonationalism has many attractions as an ideology and political program, especially the claims of collective entitlements and privileges for one's own ethnic kind and collectivity, ethnonationalist conflict and violence are unleashed as part of the process of mobilizing support for electoral reasons. But once the damage is done, the civilian administration is faced with the obligation to cope with the rehabilitation of victims and restoration of services and has to spend much money and effort in doing so. Hidden Payoffs for Aggressors Payoffs for the aggressors reinforce the purposive nature of collective violence. If the ethnic enemy that is attacked possesses assets or fills occupational and commercial niches that are envied by the aggressors, the displacement of the alleged enemy opens up economic and occupational and social opportunities for the aggressors, and thus space for the victors to occupy. There is one hitch, however. While it is easy enough to fill openings in unskilled and semiskilled work and lower levels of clerical work, it is much less so where skilled, professional, entrepreneurial, and business Page 331 management qualifications and experience are required. This circumstance has sometimes aided variable numbers of the displaced minority to return and refill that space. Moreover, a vital strategic calculation on the part of those who organize and direct violent actions is that by displacing existing populations from shantytowns and \"slums\" in urban areas, valuable real estate can be claimed for profitable schemes of urban redevelopment, middle­class housing estates, and manufacturing plants. This calculation has played an important part in the periodic riots in Karachi, in the Delhi riots of 1984, in the riots of December 1992–January 1993 in Bombay and other large Indian cities, and in the Colombo riots of 1983. Thus the euphoric and rousing identity claims of ethnonationalism and sons­of­the­soil populism are buttressed by pragmatic financial calculations. There may also be another sinister calculation behind purposively staged pogroms and ethnic cleansing. In the abovementioned Delhi and Bombay riots, the majority of targeted victims were male adults and youths, whose deaths or injury most definitely resulted in the main income earners and heads of the households of the victimized community being eliminated, leaving the old, widows, and children to cope with their reduced circumstances. The demographic reduction of the most productive age cohorts of the ethnic enemy is an intentional strategy. Whereas in India and Sri Lanka, the rape of women and their impregnation—rape as a strategy of war—and the killing of women and children have not been major objectives (although they have occurred), such acts have been prominent in ethnonationalist conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Can we Predict? Is it possible to predict which individuals in an urban population are likely to participate in collective street violence? Is it possible to identify potential offenders so as to take preventive and protective action? As noted earlier, a major limitation that an investigator of collective violence faces is that since individual rioters are rarely apprehended or easily available for questioning about their biographical particulars, it is virtually impossible to make predictions of future participation in riots on an individual basis. (It can be difficult to predict, in large numbers, who in a locality, individually identified, will participate, although intensive fieldwork in a locality may reveal to the investigator certain habitual \"thugs\" and \"gang leaders\" who are available for the work of violence and are known to have participated before.) However, a social scientist might reasonably predict on a probabilistic basis which segments of an urban popu­ Page 332 lation categorized by class, occupation, residential location, or political party affiliation might be expected to participate in violent politics at a particular time. Although unable accurately to predict the date and time when a riot might occur months or even many days ahead, an investigator may certainly recognize the signs of a buildup that may eventuate in riots, such as the timing of and dates set for elections and competitive festivals; the inflammable issues that are being aired at public meetings and in street talk; and the increased rate of circulation of proliferating rumors in public places, markets, and places of worship. While one may concoct a causal account on the basis of ex post analysis, ex ante prediction on the basis of incomplete information, contingency of events, and uncertainty of developments has all the limitations of speculation. This problem is not new to the social sciences. Preventative Action: A Recommendation Certain steps might be taken to deter and head off motivated collective violence in future. Wherever there is evidence that the central government or local government agencies are implicated, those agencies must be held responsible. The police should be multiethnic in composition and should be required to take a strong public stand against violence; prior knowledge on the part of the public that the police will not tolerate rioting is a strong deterrent. When it is suspected that violence might erupt because of certain well­known \"triggering\" events, the police must anticipate and make their purposive presence felt in the streets. A strong showing of police is necessary at the most frequent sites of violence: bazaars and business centers, bus depots, railway stations, and locations where a vulnerable minority is concentrated. The importance of these suggestions is underscored by the fact that no subsequent riots have occurred in Colombo since the riots of 1983, despite a succession of assassinations and bombings. A primary deterrent has been the firm stance taken by the governments of presidents Jayewardene, Premadasa, and Chandrika Kumaratunga that there shall be no repetition in the capital of the events of 1983. The police and the army, it is thought, are firm in this resolve, although they are culpable of searches, detentions, and harassment of alleged enemies of the state. The absence of riots in Colombo since 1983 suggests that riots are neither inevitable nor can occur as spontaneous eruptions of anger when the government is vigilant and ready to restrain them. Commentators on the recent occurrences of ethnonationalist collective violence in Indian cities have similarly surmised Page 333 that firm actions signaled and taken by the police and security forces on the lines indicated accounted for the nonoccurrence of riots in certain cities that might have otherwise broken out in violence. My conclusions about the participation of police in race riots are in agreement with those reached in some previous studies. For example, Allen D. Grimshaw reminds us of a conclusion reached by Richard D. Lambert in his unpublished 1951 study of Hindu­Muslim riots in India, which he also affirms is applicable to his own study of race riots in the United States, such as the East St. Louis riots of 1918, the Chicago riots of 1919, and the Detroit riots of 1943. Lambert found that in the context of broad changes affecting the Indian polity in the period preceding Indian independence, there was a breakdown in the formal system of social controls: Policemen came to be regarded, not as neutral arbiters of social disputes operating within a system of legal redress for grievances, but rather as armed representatives of the communities from which they were originally recruited. This interpretation of their role was accepted by members of the rival community, by members of their own community, and increasingly by policemen themselves. When this occurred the usefulness of police in social control was sharply reduced and, in some cases, police activities contributed to further disruption of social organization. The role played by police forces in urban riots in the United States has not been uniform. In at least a few cases the situation, as defined both by the police and the conflicting racial groups, has been similar to that described above. . . . In other cases, prompt and non­partisan police action has been effective in either preventing the eruption of major interracial disturbances or in confining them and bringing them to a prompt close. 33 Grimshaw aptly comments that formal police forces tend to retain the ideological orientations of the groups from which they themselves are recruited. One conclusion seems to stand the test of time and place: a highly visible display of force at the command of the police under the direction of a government that insists on uniform evenhanded application of protection and control by the police, and that is ready to call quickly on additional strength to back them when necessary, is usually an effective deterrent to the outbreak of civilian riots. The catch is that it is difficult to ensure these ideal conditions. The above proposal is not by any means a cure for the sporadic occurrence of collective violence closely linked to the competitive politics of organized groups pursuing articulated interests; it is also not an advocacy of authoritarian repression. As the Tillys put it in their account of \"the rebellious century, 1830–1930,\" for the most part, as experienced by France, Germany, and Italy, \"collective violence \\[has been\\] a by­product of collective action—a by­product, because the violence grows out of the in­ Page 334 teraction of organized groups, which are carrying on sustained collective actions.\" 34 With regard to South Asian ethnonationalist conflicts, it is also more accurate and illuminating to see contemporary violence as a conscious, even organized, mode of conducting mass politics on the part of significant political actors and their agents, rather than as a blind eruption caused by the breakdown of society and polity. The participants, of course, are not fully in control of the processes of collective violence, especially in the form of riots, or of its consequences, and if such violence is sustained and evokes organized counterviolence, it leads to civil war. Coda: The Politics of Ethnonationalism In discussing the politicization of ethnicity in South Asia, I have tried to track the manner in which large numbers of people in the new polities have become, or been made to become, conscious of ethnic identity, and how in turn they have been energized as collectivities to engage in political action. The awareness that collective ethnic identity can be used and manipulated in political action is, of course, related to the increasing possibilities of contact through the improvement of transport, of the quick adoption and deployment of modern media, and of raised levels of education and literacy and the spread of what Benedict Anderson has called \"print capitalism.\"35 Another explanation lies in the proliferation and popularization of street theaters and public arenas, occasions for collective massing of people, ranging from political rallies and elections and referendums to strikes, demonstrations, sit­ins, and mass protests. These sites and stagings allow for distinctive interpersonal and communicational processes that intensify the propensities to negative stereotyping, distorted rumormongering, and collective violence. All these capabilities for, and features of, large­scale political action have occurred in tandem with population explosions in third world countries and the migration of vast numbers of rural people to metropolitan centers and places where industries or peasant resettlement schemes have been established. Another significant factor is the proliferation of schools, colleges, and universities, which have provided sites, just as factories had done in the history of industrial development, for the production, mobilization, and massing of activists for engaging in political action. One setting for the politicization of ethnicity is the advent of \"modern\" states committed to welfare policies in the \"developing\" third world, which have become crucial and direct arbiters of economic well­being, as well as Page 335 of political status and the benefits that flow from that. Within democratic governmental systems, there are many occasions, such as elections at municipal, regional, and central levels, for like­minded members to mobilize and make claims on behalf of ethnic groups and successfully win concessions for them. This instrumental efficacy of ethnicity in making claims on the resources of the modern state inevitably in turn reinforces and maintains ethnic political machinery— patron/client networks, bossism, and patronage structures—through which affirmative action and pork­barrel distributions are dispensed. Of the monies earmarked for social services and welfare, as much or more may end up in the hands of those who dispense them as in those of the intended recipients. While these considerations apply generally, there is a special chain of circumstances that has led third world democracies in particular to enact their politics on the basis of ethnicity. At the time of decolonization in the Caribbean, in many parts of Africa, and in South and Southeast Asia, the granting of independence and the transfer of power were packaged with constitutions framed in terms of Western concepts of \"natural rights\" and civil liberties and Western procedures and institutions of representative government. Framed in the secular political language of universal rights and government by representation, such charters conferred on the rural masses and migrants to fast­forming cities a massive dose of rights and the opportunity for involvement in the political process to a degree not previously experienced. Quickly transformed from a \"passive\" existence into political actors and banks of votes, with the power to elect politicians and parties to power, they discovered that they could even demand or extort rewards, reforms, and privileges from their elected representatives, who for a while constituted the central political authority. But it became increasingly clear that the alleged secular constitution and institutions of representative government predicated on the individual rights of citizens and the willingness of citizens to form parties on the basis of competitive interests did not generate the expected outcomes. Instead, collectivities, which we may call ethnic groups, have become the political actors, seeking affirmative action for the achievement or restoration of privileges and life chances in the name of ethnic (or racial) equalization. Ethnic equalization, rather than freedom and equality of the individual, is the principal charter of participatory democracy in many of the plural and multiethnic societies of our time. It has been the experience in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia that once political demands are made on the basis of ethnic affiliation for the distribution of economic rewards, occu­ Page 336 pational positions, and educational privileges, the norm of \"equality of opportunity\" is progressively and irreversibly displaced by the norm of \"equality of result.\" 36 It is commonly the case that affirmative action and quota allocations on the basis of depressed or backward status do not speedily produce results by way of the ladder of equality of opportunity and increased access to schools and educational institutions. Thus, in time, disadvantaged groups push toward equality of results, by fiat if necessary, and for direct redistributive policies in order to equalize income, living conditions, and so forth, on a group basis. But equality of result, or redistributive politics, frequently engenders zero­sum games, in which there are distinct losers and winners. And inevitably these invidious outcomes lead to more open political competition and conflict. Finally, as a result of the revolution in rising expectations, the more successful constituencies are in achieving their political rights to vote, to elect parliaments, and to wield the stick of accountability, the more assiduously they will advocate the provision of social rights—such as the right to a job, adequate health care, unemployment insurance, and so on—as entitlements from the state. The equalization on a group basis of opportunities and rewards in the expanding universe of redistributive politics may equally be the slogan of majorities or minorities in a plural society. The language of claims is best described as that of ethnic group entitlements on the basis of relative comparison and relative deprivation. The entitlement claims of rewards equalization are contentiously sought through a privileged use of one language, or the additional use of a language so far excluded, or the imposition of special quotas providing privileged access to higher education, job opportunities, land grants, and business entrepreneurship. The \"zero­sum\" atmosphere of these quintessential entitlement claims reflects a restrictive worldview that has surfaced with vehemence precisely at a time when massive movements of people to urban places and to peasant resettlement schemes have taken and are taking place, and when mass educational and literacy programs are being implemented. Exhortations to a national effort of productive expansion that will increase the opportunities and rewards for all, thus obviating or mitigating the need for ethnic quotas, fall on deaf ears, partly because employment and income levels rise only slowly, and income distribution disparities continue to persist, and because distributive equality on ethnic lines is a politically rousing demand that promises rapid material results. A Weberian might be tempted to say that the postponement of present gratification for the sake of future prosperity and profit, Page 337 the sterling ethic of capitalism, is less effective than immediate ethnic aggrandizement as the stimulant of the masses. In countries engaged in postindependence participatory democracy, and in which the electoral process acts as a political marketplace, different scenarios for the cleavages and trajectories of ethnic conflict can be sketched, depending on the ethnic distributions and their relative standing. The relevant factors are how many groups are involved, their demographic proportions, their residential locations, their cultural, legal, and institutional distinctiveness, their levels of economic and educational achievements, and the degree of their participation in common institutional systems and of their common membership in corporate organizations. For purposes of systematic discussion, the different scenarios and trajectories pertaining to ethnic conflict should be brought within the ambit of an interpretive framework that addresses questions of how ethnic groups in an arena see themselves as acquiring, maintaining, and protecting their claimed­to­be­legitimate group entitlements (1) to capacities and \"symbolic capital\" such as education and occupation, (2) to material rewards such as incomes and commodities, and sumptuary privileges that enable distinct styles of life, and (3) to \"honors\" such as titles and offices, markers of ethnic or national pride, and religious and linguistic precedence and esteem. These honors are accorded by the state and/or other authorities that are the principal arbiters of rank. In this version of invidious and comparative \"group entitlements,\" power, prestige, occupations, material goods, aesthetic judgments, manners and morals, and religious convictions come together and naturally implicate one another. 37 \"Religion\" is not purely a matter of belief and worship but also has social and political resonances and communitarian associations; \"language\" is not a mere communicative device but has implications for educational advantage, occupation, cultural identity, literary creation, and historical legitimation of social precedence. Similarly, \"territory\" has multiple implications that go beyond spatial locations to include charged claims about \"homelands\" and ''sons of the soil.\" We have to comprehend an arena of politics where, as Donald Horowitz puts it: \"Fundamental issues, such as citizenship, electoral systems, designation of official languages and religions, the rights of groups to 'special position' in the polity, rather than merely setting the framework for politics, become the recurrent subjects of politics.\"38 The quests for group worth, group honor, group equivalence, and so on are central foci in the politics of ethnicity and critical ingredients in the spirals of intense sentiments and explosive violence that ensue. Page 338 I can envisage three overlapping scenarios that, although they are parts of a larger mural, can be presented as posing different issues and different outcomes. They cover a fair range of the major ethnic conflicts that have occurred in recent times. The picture of a plural society that J. S. Furnivall, among others, sought to characterize is especially applicable to the political economies of countries under British or Dutch colonial rule in West Africa, East Africa, the Caribbean, Indonesia, and so on. In these societies, certain ethnic groups may occupy special economic and social niches as merchants and traders (Lebanese and Syrians in West Africa, Indians in Uganda, Chinese in Malaya and Indonesia, Indians in Fiji), as plantation labor (indentured Indian labor in Guyana and Sri Lanka), or as \"bankers\" and financiers (Natukottai Chettiars in Burma and Ceylon). Again, especially in colonial capitals, there might be more complex mosaics: certain trades, certain crafts, certain local \"banking\" and credit activities being the monopoly of both indigenous and foreign communities. The occupation of niches and specialization in certain activities tends to create a segmented labor market and militate against social class solidarities that cut across ethnic lines. Ethnic division of labor stunts working­class action and middle­class associational links. Such a colonial heritage tends to crystallize expectations of \"entitlements\" as collective ethnic privileges. The colonial rulers helped to create these political maps when they distributed status honors, according to their calculations as to which groups should be rewarded, protected, or encouraged. But having persisted into the era of independence, these ethnic specializations and expectations have tended to generate ethnic conflicts when strains imperil the maintenance of boundaries. One such strain occurs when the importation of a category of manufactured goods from the industrial West threatens a local craft or makes a local service group redundant and dispensable. A fall in fortunes may threaten the group's access to the basic necessities of everyday life, and it may therefore face famine in a market of plenty and a depression in status in a political climate of expanding \"development.\" But the most severe erosion of niche­equilibrium has come from those governments of new states that have tried to open up what they consider to be the privileged monopolies of ethnic enclaves, which are accused of restrictive practices as regards recruitment and provision of services. The dispossession of Natukottai Chettiars in Rangoon and the expulsions of Indian merchants from Uganda are examples of the new civilian authorities invading what they consider to be rich preserves to enrich themselves and their civilian supporters. Foreign specialized minori­ Page 339 ties are thus vulnerable to forcible ejection or dispossession by governments promoting the interests of \"indigenous\" minorities. The second scenario relates not so much to the declining fortunes of well­placed communities as to the rising expectations and capacities of satellite minorities on the periphery who find themselves under the domination of majorities entrenched at the center and sometimes are in addition faced with the majority advancing into their frontier homelands. In Burma, Thailand, Laos, and northeast India, \"hill people\" or \"hill tribes\" are found opposed to \"valley people.\" This bifurcation carries stereotyped other contrasts in agricultural styles (sedentary versus slash­and­burn), in written versus purely oral languages, espousal of Hinduism or Buddhism versus spirit cults (although in fact commonalities exist between segments on both sides). Sometimes these satellite communities have sought advance through the ministrations of Christian missionaries, and in any case, in the new postindependence polities, they have requested \"affirmative action'' proportionate to their demographic numbers, with regard to their participation in the task of nation­state making and in the education programs of the dominant centers. These satellite ethnic/tribal minorities tend to be potential secessionists, and as Horowitz puts it, \"the largest number of secessionists can be characterized as backward groups in backward regions.\" 39 Examples are the Karens and Shans in northern Burma, Muslims (Moros) in the Philippines, the Nagas and Mizos in India, and the Kurds in Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. The third scenario represents the kind of ethnic conflict and tensions with which I am especially concerned in this book. I have adapted some concepts coined by M. G. Smith in order to characterize them.40 In a situation in which there exist a fair amount of \"cultural pluralism\" (the diverse populations have distinctive markers of dress, marriage customs, and so on) and \"social pluralism\" (the ethnic populations have roughly equivalent standings in the polity as a whole, and for some purposes aggregate as corporations and collectivities, such as political parties or religious congregations), political moves may be made by a demographically dominant ethnic population to gain advantages over minority groups and to introduce elements of sociopolitical and even religious discrimination and asymmetry, thereby incorporating the minority groups into the polity on unequal terms. Smith has discussed how processes of \"differential incorporation\" lead to the outcome of \"structural pluralism.\" Plural societies manifest differential incorporation within the larger polity when certain collectivities within it are subject to sectionally unequal distributions of Page 340 legal, political, educational, and occupational rights, and are thus reduced to a subordinate status. The \"second­class citizenship\" of a social category identified by common disabilities and disqualifications, whether racial, religious, economic, or other grounds is merely one common mode of differential incorporation. Communal rolls, restrictive property franchises, and similar arrangements also express and maintain the differential incorporation of specific collectivities within a wider society. Such mechanisms are generally developed to enhance the power of the ruling section. 41 Apartheid in South Africa and Guatemala are extreme and notorious cases of asymmetrical incorporation, but there are also somewhat more benign forms; current examples of majoritarian demands for \"affirmative action\" based on demographic strength and legitimated by mytho­historical sons­of­the­soil claims include those of the Malays, the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka, and Hindu nationalists in India. These claims lead inevitably to structural asymmetrical pluralism and are inevitably resisted by the minorities.42 Such attempts to subordinate previously unranked and equal groups who wield considerable capacities and skills, and to incorporate them unequally into the polity as inferior citizens, invite retaliation and counteractions. Alert to the threats of discrimination and subordination, and in the first instance fighting for inclusion within the polity on equal terms, they may as their situation worsens gradually gravitate toward the politics of devolution, and even secession, as has happened in Sri Lanka and India. Horowitz aptly phrases the options thus: \"Unlike ranked groups, which form part of a single society, unranked groups constitute incipient whole societies.\"43 Let me conclude by returning to a general theme that applies to all three of the scenarios I have outlined. The present plethora of ethnic conflicts, whether viewed negatively as divisive and destructive of the state, or positively as a drive toward realistic devolutionary politics, coincides with an increasing sense of shrinking economic horizons and of political embattlement. Many things have gone awry with economic development: the declining terms of trade dictated by the industrialized West; internal bottlenecks; agricultural underemployment and migration to cities; increasing disparities of income distribution; rising unemployment among the expectant participants in the literacy explosion; the visible pauperization of the urban underclass; the feminization of poverty; the entrenchment of bureaucratic interests; the pork barrels of aggrandizing politicians. Thus the plausibility of \"dependency theory\" pertaining to the impingement of world­capitalist economic relations coincides with disenchantment with Page 341 the nation­state and \"bourgeois democracy\" in internal politics, and with charges of \"internal colonialism\" exercised by dominant majorities over minorities. Such resentments in turn motivate politics compounded of new and powerful mixes, some of them seemingly contradictory and inconsistent. An example is that brand of politics that packages left radicalism or socialist goals, rightist majoritarian racism, and religious fundamentalism in one parcel. The resultant political activism— instanced by strikes, protests, and election rallies—and collective violence—instanced by riots, state terrorism, and guerrilla counteractions—undermines parliamentary democracy and the institutions of law and order on which the civil society of liberal thought rests. It is obvious that, with regard to the ethnic conflicts under discussion, stark exclusionary dualities—such as stability and continuity versus change and revolution; tradition and its death versus modernity and its birth; primordial sacred realities versus secular modern associational interests—radiate little illumination. Between these options lie the contested middle ground and volatile co­presence of both modalities. Ethnic conflicts manifest and constitute a dialectic. On the one hand, there is a universalizing and homogenizing trend that is making people in contemporary societies and countries more and more alike (whatever the actual fact of differential access to capacities, commodities, and honors) in wanting the same material and social benefits of modernization, be they income, material goods, housing, literacy and schooling, jobs, recreation, and social prestige. On the other hand, these same people also claim to be different, and not necessarily equal, on the basis of their ascriptive identity, linguistic difference, ethnic membership, and rights to the soil. In this latter incarnation, they claim that these differences, and not those of technical competence or achievement, should be the basis for the distribution of modern benefits and rewards. These compose the particularizing and separating trend among the populations of modern polities. Moreover, in modern political arenas, the appeal to allegedly ancient origins, achievements, and affiliations, recast and re­presented in \"revivalist\" or \"fundamentalist\" dress, enables a mobilization of people on a scale never known or possible before, partly by the use of modern media of communication and propaganda, by the transmission through printed textbooks of tendentious ideas in proliferating schools, and by the promise of benefits and concurrent release of energies, both creative and destructive, at levels never before achieved, for deployment in elections and in mass activities. These developments are not merely old wine in new bottles, or new wine in old bottles, for there are more potent transformative processes at Page 342 work by which old categories and definitions of ethnic identity and interests are revalued and given new dimensions and contours. For example, for all their appeals to old labels and historical claims, in their present manifestations, the Sinhalese, the Malays, and the Fijians are collectivities formed in the late colonial and postcolonial epochs. Their ethnic boundaries are porous and flexible. At the same time, we witness the new values of modernization and progress—industrial employment, professional skills, and the practice of Western medicine—being recategorized as entitlements and sumptuary privileges indexed as quotas assignable to preexisting ethnic or racial or indigenous groupings. The time of becoming the same is also the time of claiming to be different. The time of modernizing is also the time of inventing tradition, as well as traditionalizing innovations; of revaluing old categories and recategorizing new values; of bureaucratic benevolence and bureaucratic resort to force; of participatory democracy and dissident civil war. The time is not simply one of order, or disorder, or antiorder: it is compounded of all three. Ubiquitous and violent ethnic conflict is one of the marks of these intense times through which we are living, and which we can see only darkly in the looking glass. In the late twentieth century, a surprising number of militant and seemingly \"irrational\" eruptions have occurred. They challenge the confident post­Enlightenment prophecies that the decline of religion was inevitable, or that at best, it could only survive in a demythologized form; that primordial loyalties and sentiments would fade into oblivion as national integration took effect, or be carried away as flotsam by the currents of world historical process. These violent and ubiquitous explosions also challenge and strain our conventional social science explanations of order, disorder, and conflict. However inadequately, we must cope somehow with the phenomenon of destructive violence that accompanies ethnonationalist conflict today. Page 343 NOTES Chapter 1. The Wider Context 1.

Esman, ed., Ethnic Conflict in the Western World (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1977). 3. Some scholars would include the struggles of blacks against discrimination in the United States and in South Africa as falling within the ambit of ethnic conflict. 4. Although 75 percent of the population of the mountainous Nagorno­Karabakh region are ethnic Armenians, it was included in the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan in 1923. The former USSR is said to have had more than 100 distinct nationalities and ethnic groups, living in 15 republics. 5. The ethnologist Galina Komarova reported at a conference I attended in 1991 that at that time, \"there were more than ninety points of ethnic tension\" in the former USSR, three times more than in the conflicts prevailing in 1990. Between 725,000 and 1,500, 000 persons had been displaced and forced to migrate. 6. The list must now include the genocidal violence in 1994–95 between the Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda, and the Russian offensive against secessionist Chechnya. 7. There are many listings of ethnic conflict and displacement of people as a worldwide phenomenon—see, e.g., Sven Tägil, Regions in Upheaval: Ethnic Conflict and Political Mobilization (Solna, Sweden: Esselte Studium, 1984), and Donald L. Horowitz, Ethnic Groups in Conflict (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985). 8. Under the caption, \"Pakistan Arms­Dealers Hail God and the AK­47,\" the New York Times, March 8, 1988, reported that the following wares were on show in an arms store in Darra Adam Khel, an hour's drive south of Peshawar: \"In addition to various versions of the Soviet AK­47 rifle, the arms dealer said he supplies \\[Afghan guerrillas\\] with ammunition, at nine cents a round, and such weapons as Page 344 Chinese and Soviet rocket launchers, pistols from various countries, Soviet, Chinese and American land mines, and machine guns, largely of Soviet manufacture.\" The smuggling route is a saga in itself: some goods are sent by ship from Europe to Singapore, and from there to the Soviet Union, from whence they are sent by truck to Kabul! 9.

Throughout the nineteenth century, the majority of the Sinhalese representatives appointed to the Legislative Council were Protestant Christians of the Goyigama caste elite, such as James Alwis and J. P. Obeyesekere (James Pieris later became the first Karava Christian to be appointed). No Buddhist was elected to the Legislative Council of 1921, in which all the elected Sinhalese members were Protestant or Catholic. Buddhist activists managed to change the pattern for the first time in the elections of 1924, when the majority of Sinhalese elected were Buddhist. At the General Election of 1931, of the 38 Sinhalese returned, 28 were declared Buddhists.

The Roman Catholic cathedral of St. Lucia in Colombo received its cathedral status in 1838 but dates back at least to the eighteenth century. Work on rebuilding and enlarging it started in 1852 and was completed in 1887. At the time of the 1883 riot, the nave had been completed. 16. Gunananda had been an ordained monk earlier in his life, then disrobed to become a layman, and subsequently rejoined the Sangha in the capacity of samanera (novice). He was not reordained. 17.

The Riot Commission report records that the Buddhists, elated by securing their license, are alleged to have sent taunting anonymous letters to Catholics, saying, \"You fools! You tried to stop our wedding on the funeral day of that God of yours! You couldn't do it! We will come in with the procession on Friday—stop it if you can!\" (ibid., p. 12). 21. Report; Somaratna, Kotahena Riot, p. 14. 22. Somaratna, Kotahena Riot, pp. 409, 415, notes that some Buddhist monks connected with Gunananda's Dipaduttama Vihara held processions and caused trouble in Ratnapura and Balangola on the same Easter Sunday. A procession in Galle was planned to take place on the same Sunday in order to clash with the procession staged by Roman Catholics. Subsequent Buddhist peraheras similarly Page 347 processed past the localities and villages of Catholics. Somaratna plausibly infers that these events could not be considered \"spontaneous, isolated and unconnected.\" 23. Rogers, Crime, Justice and Society, p. 178. 24. Report; Somaratna, Kotahena Riot, pp. 23–24. 25. Rogers, Crime, Justice and Society, p. 179; Report. Rogers also suggests that although the ferocity of Catholic feelings took the priests of St. Lucia by surprise, \"the desire of Pagnani and his colleagues to use their authority to defuse the situation may be questioned.\" 26. Somaratna, Kotahena Riot, p. 402, reports that Gunananda apparently maintained good relations with Governor Longden, and constantly proclaimed his loyalty to the British government. A tantalizing tit­bit is that \"the Royal Arms of England were emblazoned above the recumbent figure of the Buddha at the Kotahena temple,\" the same image that was the focus of the March festivities. The story among the people at this time was that the British sovereign gave official sanction to Buddhism and for holding the processions without interference. 27. Memorandum from Olcott to the earl of Derby, May 17, 1884, reproduced in Somaratna, Kotahena Riot, pp. 76–77. Eventually, the British restored the right to hold processions with tom­toms under certain conditions, and Vesak became a holiday. (Rogers, Crime, Justice and Society, p. 180, reports that after the clash at Kotahena, a prominent \"Buddhist response was to increase the number of processions through Catholic neighborhoods and by churches,\" and that \"these processions became a permanent source of contention\" in the ensuing years.) But the \"temporalities\" question remained unsolved, because the Sangha resisted surrendering its property rights to lay control. The request for \"Buddhist registrars\" was denied by the Colonial Office at this time. 28. See Kingsley M. de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981), pp. 343–46, for additional information on the Kotahena episode and its aftermath. 29.

Malcolm, was the architect of British military action, believed that the rioting had been organized by Western­educated Ceylonese who were determined to undermine the imperial power. Stubbs informed the Colonial Office in London that the disturbances were initiated by \"a set of skunks—mostly I regret to say men educated in Europe—one or two Cambridge men among them if stories are true\" (C.O. 54/782, 29924, letter of R.E.

On March 2, when the centenary occurred, the Sinhalese newspaper Dinamina printed a copy of the treaty in Sinhalese, articles of a nationalist tone on Ceylon's history by E.W. Perera and D.B.

Fraser included an account of the events in Kandy, and of the valorous conduct of his students and teachers, in a report circulated to the school's well­wishers in England, some four of whom were apparently members of parliament. Speaking on behalf of the secretary of state for the colonies, Sir Arthur Steel­Maitland unjustifiably cited Fraser as supporting his \"conspiracy\" theory of the riots. This subsequently led to a prolonged and unpleasant controversy between E.W. Perera, a prominent Sinhalese politician, and a reluctant Fraser as to what Fraser had written in his report. This controversy itself is not germane to my account of the riots, but what Fraser had to say about the origins of the riots, that they were \"organized in advance,\" without being \"designed against British rule\" is of relevance to us. 44.

Samaraweera, \"Arabi Pasha in Ceylon.\" In exile in Ceylon, Arabi became a law­abiding citizen. His nationalist role in Egypt gave him prestige, however, and his very presence in Ceylon gave him a charismatic status. He played a role in the Muslim revivalist movement, in particular emphasizing the necessity for the backward Muslims of Ceylon to become educated. 66. Ali, \"1915 Racial Riots,\" p. 7. 67. Ibid., pp. 9–10. See also M.M.M. Mahroof, \"Muslim Education in Ceylon, 1881–1901,\" Islamic Culture 47, 4 (1973). Samaraweera (1976, 1979) is somewhat less enthusiastic than Ali (1981) in assessing the actual progress made in education, in forming associations, and in literary activities by the Muslim community, as for instance compared with the achievements of the Sinhalese and Tamil revivalist movements. 68.

Typical representatives of the national elite Roberts identifies are the Panabokkes; descendants of Francisco de Mel of Moratuwa and of Harmanis Dias of Panadura, and of Ponnambalam Mudaliyar of Colombo; the Pedrises of Galle and Colombo; the Senanayakes of Botale; the Diases and Dias Bandaranaikes of Veyangoda; and the six advocate Jayewardenes. The pelantiyas of local elite status are many, and the leading individuals Roberts identifies for urban areas include C. Don Bastian, Piyadasa Sirisena, Thomas Karunaratne, and P. H. Abraham Silva.

Amirthalingam, a Tamil member of Parliament, in which the latter alleged that \"a large number of unruly elements were mobilized and brought to Galle Face Green . . . volunteers Page 351 who went around distributing leaflets were beaten up by the mob. Notwithstanding this assault . . . they proceeded towards the Parliament. Before they could move very far a mob waving the lion flag attacked them, beat them with fists and sticks and kicked them\" (A.

It has been estimated that almost a hundred industrial plants, including twenty garment factories, were severely damaged or destroyed. The cost of industrial reconstruction was estimated at 2 billion rupees. This figure excludes the damage done to hundreds of shops and small trading establishments (see Neelan Tiruchelvam, \"July '83 and Collective Violence,\" p. 6). Ambassador Dissanayaka (Agony in Sri Lanka, p. 81) has this to say about the targeting of Tamil business interests: \"The Tamil owned Maharaja Organization is the largest commercial establishment in Sri Lanka next to the Upali group. They lost six factories in Ramalana, including Ponds, S­lon, and Berec. By evening their Head Office in Bankshall Street and their new subsidiary Hettiaratchi Brothers, which still bore its Sinhala name, were set on fire. Barring the Maharaja Organization, the largest Tamil commercial establishments in Sri Lanka were St. Anthony's Hardware Stores, K. G. Industries and Easwaran Brothers. They were also situated in Grandpass. They were all consigned to the flames.\" 17. On these developments, viewed as contributing to the direction and scale of the anti­Tamil violence in 1983, see Newton Gunasinghe, \"The Open Economy and Its Impact on Ethnic Relations in Sri Lanka,\" ch. 6 of Committee for Rational Development, Sri Lanka: The Ethnic Conflict—Myths, Realities and Perspectives (New Delhi: Navrang, 1984); and Sunil Bastian, \"The Political Economy of Ethnic Violence in Sri Lanka: The July 1983 Riots,\" ch. 11 of Mirrors of Violence: Communities, Riots and Survivors in South Asia ed.

Regarding the first rumor of Sikh celebration of Mrs. Gandhi's death, the authors of Who Are the Guilty? say that after careful inquiry, they are of the view that while some instances of \"demonstrative gestures\" may have been enacted by some Sikhs and non­Sikhs, \"such cases were few and isolated.\" The Report of the Citizens' Commission also refers to the mischievous role of rumors, and regarding the allegation that Sikh students had danced the bhangra (a Punjabi festive dance) on hearing of Mrs. Gandhi's death: \"A University Professor investigated the allegation . . . her findings, which were published in a newspaper, revealed that some Sikh students had been rehearsing for a college cultural show and that bhangra was one of the featured items. As soon as they heard the news of the assassination, they stopped their rehearsal\" (pp. 36–37). 28. RCC, pp. 14–15. 29. Chakravarty and Haksar, Delhi Riots, p. 108. 30. Ibid., pp. 449–50. 31.

While pointedly accusing the ruling party, the Commission did not exonerate other parties: \"We have been equally disturbed by the apathy and ambivalence of other political parties. We have received no information that any of them played any significant role in providing either protection or shelter, relief or succor, in any of the affected localities.\" 51. In a column by M. Mitta titled \"Riot and Retribution,\" India Today (February 15, 1996, p. 14) reports that \"former Union minister H. K. L. Bhagat,\" whose \"name repeatedly figured in the string of inquiries into the 1984 anti­Sikh riots in Delhi . . . was arraigned for the first time last fortnight. . . . Sessions judge, S.N. Dhingra, issued a non­bailable arrest warrant against Bhagat after a riot victim, Satnami Bhai, deposed on January 15 this year that he had personally instigated the mob that killed her husband.\" The trial that began ten years ago against 150 persons, including Bhagat, has until now made little headway. It pertained to the killings that took place in Trilokpuri, \"the worst­affected locality in Delhi . . . and part of Bhagat's then East Delhi constituency.\" It is further reported that the Misra Commission set up in 1985 \"had received 16 affidavits alleging that Bhagat had addressed meetings in his constituency inciting \\[Congress\\] party workers to violence. Also, the Jain­Aggarwal Committee, which was a follow­up to the Misra Commission, recommended the registration of a murder case against Bhagat in 1991 for the killing of a Sikh head constable during the riots.\" This information thus at least implicates a high­ranking member of the Congress (I) Party and a union minister in the staging and direction of the 1984 riots. Another leader whom the Delhi police are seeking permission to prosecute is Delhi MP Sajjan Kumar, who is accused of \"leading a mob that killed one Navin Singh at Sultanpuri in west Delhi.\" Thus plausible evidence of the role of some prominent members of the Congress government in the riots is slowly surfacing.

One hears this view frequently, wherever ethnic riots take place: \"If only the army had been called out in time, the riots could have been scotched.\" The fact is that politicians and civil authorities usually are loath to call in the army at the beginning, when the dam bursts, and the authorities usually say they are \"surprised\" by the sudden disorder. The politicians are reluctant to suppress by force a political outburst by a public whom they electorally represent, and whose support they need for reelection. Frequently, members of the police force find it difficult to enforce law and order when they themselves share the interests and views of the civilians they serve and consort with them. 60.

A particular irritant to Sikh nationalists is Article 25, section 2b, of the Indian Constitution, which in giving all Hindus the right of access to public Hindu shrines, includes within the category of \"Hindu\" all \"persons professing the Sikh, Jain or Buddhist religion.\" In the case of civil marriage, Sikhs are still governed by the Hindu Code (1955–56), and inheritance among Sikhs is governed by the Hindu Succession Act. 82. I am here referring to the battle between the Sinhala government and the JVP, whose members were Sinhalese youth. The civil war between the militant Tamils, especially the Tigers (LTTE), was also taking place at that time. 83.

For example, Guru Nanak was a Bedi, and the Bedis, together with the Sodhis, enjoyed eminence and a wide religious patronage in Central Punjab. Sahib Singh Bedi was greatly respected by Ranjit Singh, accompanied him on several military expeditions, and officiated at the coronation ceremonies when Ranjit Singh proclaimed himself maharaja of the Punjab. Sahib Singh was endowed with extensive land rents, and the Bedi families were an important segment of the ruling elite of Lahore state. 97. Ibid., p. 124. 98. Ibid., pp. 306, 316. 99.

Harjot Oberoi's historical and ethnographic study stops at around 1920. 105. Rahit­namas dealt with life­cycle rites, behavioral taboos, transgression of Khalsa boundary rules, the specification and constitution of sacred space, and so on. For example, they laid down the procedure for the famous initiation rite of khande ki pakul (drinking of sweetened water stirred with a double­edged sword), specified that mortuary rites should not be followed by public lamentation, and recommended that during the mourning period, the complete Adi Granth should be read (together with the singing of kirtan (hymns) and the distribution of alms). But they did not interfere with marriage rituals, which followed the caste and lineage customs of the wider Punjabi society. 106. The Nanakshahi Calendar commencing in 1469, the year of Guru Nanak's birth, replaced the Bikrami Calendar (starting in 57 C.E.), the Sikh New Year was to start on the first day of the month of Baisakh (April­May) instead of the month of Chet (March­April), and Guru Nanak's birth was changed to coincide with the New Year's day. A campaign was also launched to dissuade Sikhs from taking part in Hindu festivals such as Holi and Diwali. 107. Gurmukhi is one of the several scripts in which Punjabi can be written, and the Granth itself is composed in a ''melange of various languages coalesced under the generic title of Sant Bhasa\" (Oberoi, Construction of Religious Boundaries, p. 348). 108.

The perceptions and predilections of the Indian Army authorities regarding Sikhism were not necessarily shared by other British official and administrative circles in India, and there were conflicts among them about the regulation of Sikh shrines. 112. Fox, Lions of the Punjab, p. 10. Fox reiterates this thesis throughout the book, saying, e.g.: \"The British military selectively recruited the cultural meanings defining Sikh identity from the past, then validated, spread, and, most important, constituted them in the very organization of their colonial army\" (p. 178). 113. See, e.g., Ian J. Kerr, \"Fox and the Lions: The Akali Movement Revisited,\" in Sikh History and Religion in the Twentieth Century, ed. Joseph T. O'Connell, Milton Israel, and Willard G. Oxtoby (University of Toronto, South Asian Studies Papers, no. 3 \\[1990\\]). Kerr says that Fox's emphasis on the recruiting and organizational policies of the British Indian Army is \"strained, overdone\" (p. 218). 114. Fox, Lions of the Punjab, p. 11. 115. Ibid., p. 87. 116. Ibid., p. 178. 117. Both the Arya Samaj and the Singh Sabha as conflicting reformist religions arose among the lower middle class in urban Punjab. \"The Arya Samaj successfully converted only the low caste menials in the rural areas, but this success of urban reformers alienated the major cultivating castes\" (ibid., p. 162). The Arya Samaj also lacked the kind of strong separatist identity that helped mobilize both urban and rural Sikhs under one banner. Page 358 118. Ibid., p. 171. 119. Ibid., p. 172. 120.

This precipitated a crisis, leading to the first martial­law government. During the constitutional debates, religious leaders had argued for an amendment declaring the Ahmediyya a non­Muslim minority, on the grounds that their leader Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908) proclaimed himself a prophet and thus defied the essential Islamic tenet that Muhammad was the last of the prophets. They also pressed for Ahmedi officials, including Pakistan's foreign minister, Zafrullah Khan, to be dismissed from office, since non­Muslims cannot be entrusted with high positions in light of their want of commitment to the state's Islamic tenets. 5. Shaheed, \"Pathan­Muhajir Conflicts,\" p. 197. In 1974 the National Assembly under Bhatti amended the Constitution to declare the Ahmedis to be a non­Muslim minority. 6. The Ahmedi issue surfaced in 1983–84 in a potentially explosive manner. Reacting to a worldwide conference of Ahmedis at Rabwah in 1983, a large number of Sunni and Shiite ulama (Muslim clerics) met and called for government action to prohibit Ahmedis from using Islamic terms, remove them from civil and military posts, and confiscate their newspapers and literature. They also wanted the death penalty to be imposed for apostasy. The government inserted an ordinance in the Penal Code stipulating punishment for any Ahmedi who called himself a Muslim, used Islamic terms, preached or propagated his faith, and so on. 7. Anwar H.

In The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985; paperback edition, 1994), Ayesha Jalal gives a penetrating analysis of Jinnah's deliberations before Partition. \"What Jinnah was clamouring for was a way of achieving equal say for Muslims in any all­India arrangements at the centre. By denying that Indian Muslims were a minority and asserting that they were a nation, Jinnah advanced the... argument that since India contained at least two nations, a transfer of power necessarily involved the dissolution of British India's unitary structure of central authority, and any reconstitution of the centre would have to take account of the League's demand that Muslim provinces, the territorial expression of this claim to nationhood, should be grouped to constitute a separate state\" (p. 241). But the realization of this Muslim state as part of a larger Indian union was not possible in the case of Punjab and Bengal, which could not become part of a Muslim state within their existing boundaries because they had large non­Muslim minorities. This was the \"fatal contradiction\" in the demand that eventually led to Partition. Lacking the assurance that Punjab and Bengal would be territorially included in the proposed state of Pakistan, which would have given him a position of strength from which to negotiate broader all­India arrangements, including division of the armed forces, Jinnah finally had to settle for the \"mutilated and moth­eaten Pakistan\" he had previously rejected, stripped of the eastern Punjab and western Bengal and Calcutta (ibid., p. 246). 46. Included among such groups were the Jamiyyat i­Ulama Islam (the Organization of Islamic Ulama), the Jamiyyat i­Ulama­i­Pakistan (the Organization of Pakistan Ulama), the Jama at­i­Islami (the Islamic Society). 47.

The death toll since January 1, 1995, was reported as being 850. Pakistan's commercial capital is now hobbled by the MQM's battles with the security forces as well as with its own divisive factions and Sindhi militant groups. Chapter 7. Some General Features of Ethnic Riots and Riot Crowds 1. Mention has already been made of writings by Gyanendra Pandey and Sandria Freitag on the so­called Hindu­Muslim riots that occurred at rural and urban sites in Uttar Pradesh in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Ethnic riots also occur in border regions whose local inhabitants and \"tribes\" feel that their homelands are being appropriated by immigrants and \"aliens,\" and that they themselves are being demographically swamped by the new colonists. Similar attitudes are generated in interior provinces where new peasant resettlement schemes are instituted and populated by peasants transplanted from other overcrowded and poverty­stricken areas. In Sri Lanka, this is a major issue in the ongoing ethnic conflict among Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims. For treatment of this issue in India, see Myron Weiner, Sons of the Soil: Migration and Ethnic Conflict in India (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1978). 2.

To the concept of \"ritualization of collective violence,\" I would contrast the reverse concept \"disruption of a routinized life marked by life cycle and calendrical rituals\" to highlight the trauma of dislocation and disorder experienced by the victims of collective violence who feel the consequences of mob violence at the most individual and personal levels: as the loss of one's own father, mother, daughter, or son; loss of one's home and belongings, imprinted with a particular personal and domestic history; and the inability to cope with the work of mourning when the deaths have been sudden and meaningless, and the bodies summarily burnt, spirited away, or shoveled into collective graves, thereby denying the survivors even the consolation of mortuary rites to formulate coping and offer comforting sentiments. This topic of the disruption of the routinized life of victims will not, however, be dealt with in this book. 16.

The story of the Hindutva movement since 1925—its ideology and political and social activities; the social composition of its component units (the Sangh Parivar); its increasing focus on the Ayodhya issue; and its increasingly successful electoral performance, combined with spectacular techniques and campaigns for mobilization of crowds, especially since 1984—and the alleged crisis of secular politics it has precipitated cannot be fully told here and is the subject of another book, now in preparation. 6. Shah Bano, a Muslim woman divorced by her Muslim husband, sued for maintenance in 1980. The court decision was in her favor, but some Muslim ulama protested, saying that the decision was against traditional shari'ah practice. Rajiv Gandhi, then prime minister, had the decision overturned by means of a parliamenatary regulation permitting Muslims to observe their traditional \"personal laws.\" The BJP objection is that whereas the government had already subjected all Hindus to the Hindu Code (1955–56), which effected a drastic reform of Hindu law, it was now giving a special exemption to Muslims, thereby negating the goal of instituting a unified civil code for all Indian citizens. 7. The Mandal Commission report, written in 1980 and shelved for a time, calculated the OBC's to amount to around 52 percent of India's population and recommended reservation of 27 percent of certain levels of central government employment for them. Since the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes already had 22.5 percent of central government (services and public sector) jobs reserved for them, the implementation of the Mandal recommendations would give all \"backward classes\" a total of 49.5 percent of the jobs. Upper­ and middle­caste youth objected to this allocation. 8. Frontline, Feb. 12, 1993, p. 5. 9. Asghar Ali Engineer, \"When Bombay Erupted,\" Frontline, Feb. 26, 1993, p. 128. 10. V.K.

We should also note that in Massenpsychologie und Ich­Analyse, Freud explicitly states that he is not concerned with Le Bon's \"heterogeneous\" and volatile crowds, but with Le Bon's \"homogeneous\" groups, examples of which for Freud were organized and enduring institutions such as churches, armies, and political parties. For this reason, we can leave aside Freud's text as largely peripheral to our subject. 2. See Serge Moscovici L'Age des foules (1981), trans, by J. C.

Beresford in the Guardian (Aug. 13, 1983), independently verified by Spencer, and cited by the latter. On July 27, a crowd collected to attack Tamil homes in a street in Badulla, a town in Uva Province. When the police failed to respond to the desperate summons of the Tamil residents, a well­known Tamil merchant who lived on the street fired a shotgun in the air to scare the crowd away. At this point, soldiers from the Sri Lankan army arrived and fired on the house. \"The men in the Tamil homes in the street who were not beaten and hacked to death, were shot by the soldiers.\" The merchant's wife was then told by the soldiers to go into her house and bring \"the other Tigers and guns\" (Spencer, \"Collective Violence,\" p. 618). 46.

Governor Sir Robert Chalmers was a highly regarded Pali scholar who admired Buddhism and sympathized with Buddhist interests.

He vacated his position as governor soon afterwards. 50. A. E Kannangara, \"The Riots of 1915 in Sri Lanka: A Study in the Roots of Communal Violence.\" Past and Present 102 (1983): 155–58. 51.

In physical theory, the frequency of blue light is about twice as high as the frequency of red light. \"As a swift luminous object approaches you the frequency Page 370 of its light appears enhanced—it becomes 'blue' or at least shifts in the direction of the high­frequency, blue end of the spectrum. Physicists and astronomers call it a blue shift. Conversely, an object going away appears 'red'—its light is red shifted . . . Blue, the high­frequency light, corresponds with high energy and high temperatures, while red, the low­frequency, represents lesser energy and cooler conditions\" (Nigel Calder, Einstein's Universe \\[New York: Greenwich House, 1979\\], p.9). Christian Doppler was a Viennese physicist, working in the early nineteenth century, who described the effect carefully, extending it from sound to light. The Doppler effect translated into sound effect is perhaps even more apposite for conceptualizing some aspects of ethnic riots and crowd violence. As the eminent physicist Stephen W. Hawking explains: \"This relationship between frequency and speed, which is called the Doppler effect, is an everyday experience. Listen to a car passing on the road: as the car is approaching, its engine sounds a higher pitch (corresponding to a higher frequency of sound waves), and when it passes and goes away, it sounds at lower pitch. The behavior of light or radio waves is similar. Indeed, the police make use of the Doppler effect to measure the speed of cars by measuring the frequency of pulses of radio waves reflected off them\" (A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes \\[New York: Bantam Books, 1988\\], pp. 38–39). 53.

The government provides support for the rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists, the SP said, adding that the Maoist leaders were terrorising innocent tribals and forcing them to join the banned Maoist party to engage them in illegal activities for their selfish interests. Knowingly and unknowingly, some went underground and now find it difficult to join the mainstream of life. **Read less...** | | May - 2 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders are resorting to acts of violence in Bhadradri Kothagudem District of Telangana, said Bhadrachalam, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Paritosh Pankaj, on May 2, reports Telangana Today.

In a statement, ASP Pankaj said, Maoists were committing criminal offences to show their presence and harassing the innocent tribal people of the agency areas. The Naxals \\[Left Wing extremists, LWEs\\] have become obstacles to development. The top leaders of the Maoist party were compelling their lower-level cadres to commit illegal activities with the aim of extorting money and troubling innocent tribals in many ways for their selfish interests. Minor boys and girls were being tortured by the Naxals forcing them to join the Maoist party. The ASP noted that many cadres attracted by the ‘Operation Chayutha’ are planning to surrender, but they were being prevented doing so by Maoist top leadership. **Read less...** | | May - 11 | Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. In a statement the official said that Maoist top leadership for the wellbeing of their family members have been making the lower ranks scapegoats. Innocent Adivasi youths were being forced to join the Maoist party and giving them arms to attack Police forces. For the selfish needs of Maoists, the lives of Adivasi boys and girls were being spoiled as they were deprived of education. Maoists like Sodi Jogaiah, Rajesh, Sodi Mada and others, killed in encounters, were made to join the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] when they were minor in age and the party top leadership should take responsibility for their deaths, the SP said. Maoist leaders Damodar, Azad, Aruna and others sending ill-gotten money to their family members but meting out injustice to Adivasi families, which were compelled to sacrifice their children for Maoist leaders, SP, Vineeth noted. **Read less...** | | May - 13 | Drones will be put into service to keep an eye on the movements of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) in Koraput, Odisha Director General of Police (DGP) Sunil Kumar Bansal said on May 13 during his visit to the district, reports sambadenglish.com.

Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas. The Maoists are also developing drones to carry and drop up to five kilograms of explosives on Police Stations.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger.

In a press note issued on November 23, the OSD reminded people that Maoists had issued a statement urging the people to boycott the impending Assembly elections slated for November 30. He, however, reassured the public of the foolproof security arrangements in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections. The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

    "full_text": "# RedNovember Targets Government, Defense, and Technology Organizations _Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was July 25, 2025_ ## Executive Summary In July 2024, Insikt Group publicly [reported](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on TAG-100, a threat activity group conducting suspected cyber-espionage activity targeting high-profile government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally using the open-source, multi-platform Go backdoor Pantegana. At the time, we did not attribute this activity to a particular country; however, after reviewing all available evidence, we assess that TAG-100 is highly likely a Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group. Accordingly, Insikt Group now tracks this group under the designation RedNovember. Between June 2024 and July 2025, RedNovember (which overlaps with Storm-2077) targeted perimeter appliances of high-profile organizations globally and used the Go-based backdoor Pantegana and Cobalt Strike as part of its intrusions. The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified new likely victims, which include a ministry of foreign affairs in central Asia, a state security organization in Africa, a European government directorate, and a Southeast Asian government. RedNovember also likely compromised at least two United States (US) defense contractors, a European engine manufacturer, and a trade-focused intergovernmental cooperation body in Southeast Asia. We observed RedNovember reconnoitering and likely compromising edge devices for initial access, including SonicWall, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), F5 BIG-IP, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, Sophos SSL VPN, and Fortinet FortiGate instances, as well as Outlook Web Access (OWA) instances and Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN appliances. RedNovember’s activity exemplifies the ability to combine weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits with open-source post-exploitation frameworks such as Pantegana, lowering the entry barrier for less-capable threat actors. It also allows higher-tier groups to refrain from using customized tools during operations in which they are less concerned with being detected or in which heightened attribution obfuscation is desirable. Insikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded Future's notification policy. ## Key Findings - RedNovember continues to rely on command-and-control (C2) frameworks (Pantegana and Cobalt Strike) and open-source backdoors (SparkRAT) for its operations. - The threat group has significantly broadened its targeting, including by conducting spearphishing and vulnerability exploitation attempts against entities in the US Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and space organizations in Europe. - At least some of the RedNovember activity that Insikt Group observed, including in Taiwan and Panama, took place in close proximity to geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China. - RedNovember has also increasingly focused its initial access efforts on targeting edge devices, including security solutions such as VPNs, firewalls, load balancers, virtualization infrastructure, and email servers. - In April 2025, the threat group conducted a campaign focused on the reconnaissance and targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices across multiple countries. Specific targets included a major US newspaper and a specialized US engineering and military contractor. ## Background RedNovember (previously tracked as TAG-100 and overlapping with Storm-2077) is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage group that leverages open-source tools and exploits internet-facing devices to target government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally. Insikt Group has previously publicly [reported](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on RedNovember’s use of the multi-platform Go-based backdoor Pantegana and other offensive security tools, including Cobalt Strike and SparkRAT, coupled with exploitation of perimeter appliances, to conduct reconnaissance, initial access, and probable compromise activities. RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution, a tactic that aligns with broader state-sponsored cyber-espionage trends that Insikt Group has observed. Combining weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits and open-source tools enables RedNovember to operate at scale. RedNovember’s activity highlights the persistent vulnerabilities of perimeter devices, which remain a significant risk vector due to limited visibility and logging capabilities. RedNovember is one of multiple [other](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf) Chinese state-sponsored threat groups that are increasingly achieving initial access to targets by targeting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices, including security products. Targeting internet-facing devices has proven to be an effective way for Chinese state-sponsored threat groups to scale initial access and achieve initial footholds in large numbers of organizations ahead of more targeted follow-on activity. ## Technical Analysis Since our initial [public report](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on its activity, RedNovember has continued to use the Pantegana C2 framework and Cobalt Strike as part of its intrusion activity. From our visibility and collection, RedNovember also highly likely continues to use ExpressVPN to administer its servers and may, with realistic probability, have started using other VPNs such as Warp VPN to remotely connect to its infrastructure. **_Figure 1:_** _Overview of RedNovember operations (Source: Recorded Future)_ While monitoring RedNovember’s active C2 servers, Insikt Group observed a number of victims on a global scale across the public and private sectors, but concentrated in the following verticals: aerospace and defense, government, and professional services. In addition to suspected compromise activity by RedNovember, we observed other network communications between multiple organizations and C2 servers associated with RedNovember, likely reflecting, at a minimum, general browsing activity and potentially reconnaissance efforts by the threat group. While the activity could be indicative of an intent to compromise, in these cases, there is currently insufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. The terms “compromise,” “targeting,” “reconnaissance,” and “browsing\" are used specifically throughout this report to clarify the kind of activity observed. For example, where we assess that RedNovember compromised an entity, we will use terms such as “compromise” and “victim.” ### Victimology, Targeting, and Reconnaissance Between H2 2024 and H2 2025, RedNovember compromised, targeted, and reconnoitered organizations on a global scale. In particular, RedNovember heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, and, in April 2025, it focused its reconnaissance on over 30 Panamanian government organizations. **_Figure 2:_** _Mapping of countries with organizations compromised or targeted by RedNovember (Source: Recorded Future)_ #### Targeting of Government, Intergovernmental, and Diplomatic Entities RedNovember has targeted government and diplomatic organizations across many countries, as well as intergovernmental organizations. Insikt Group has identified the likely targeting of Outlook Web Access (OWA) portals belonging to a South American country prior to that country's state visit to China. Similar RedNovember activity has been observed targeting OWA portals belonging to ministries of foreign affairs in Southeast Asia and South America. Since at least mid-2024, RedNovember has highly likely compromised the following targets: - A 3CX web client instance associated with the ministry responsible for museums in a western European country - A Zimbra Collaboration Suite server associated with a Southeast Asian country - A Fortinet FortiGate appliance likely associated with the foreign affairs ministry of an East Asian country - A Huawei router likely associated with a Southeast Asian government - An African government’s Cisco ASA appliance Insikt Group also observed communications suggesting a long-running compromise of an intergovernmental organization based in Southeast Asia at least up until March 2025. Other Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, including RedDelta, have previously targeted official intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia, likely for the purposes of espionage. Additionally, in March and April 2025, Insikt Group observed evidence suggesting the likely compromise of an additional intergovernmental organization based in Southeast Asia. ##### Taiwan Between December 9, 2024, and December 16, 2024, Insikt Group observed communications from a RedNovember malicious server, _198\\[.\\]98\\[.\\]50\\[.\\]218_, also hosting a Pantegana C2, to a location in Taiwan that is home to a Taiwan Air Force military airbase and is also a primary location for semiconductor research and development. On December 9, 2024, China [conducted](https://www.dw.com/en/china-breaks-silence-on-large-military-drills-around-taiwan/a-71042704) a surprise military exercise around Taiwan, which involved around 90 warships and coast guard vessels and included simulating attacks on foreign ships and practicing the blockading of sea routes. In April 2025, RedNovember also conducted reconnaissance against infrastructure associated with two national scientific research organizations in Taiwan, including one focusing on research and development work related to semiconductors. ##### South Korea Insikt Group first observed RedNovember targeting South Korea in late August 2024. Between late August 2024 and March 2025, RedNovember compromised a Korean nonprofit organization in the financial services sector. The organization was observed communicating with several of the threat group’s Pantegana C2 servers. Korean organizations were also targeted as part of RedNovember’s April 2025 exploitation wave against Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices, such as when Insikt Group observed the suspected compromise of a nuclear safety-related organization in South Korea funded by the Korean government, which is a top research and development entity and has been significantly involved in South Korea’s supercomputing and quantum computing efforts. RedNovember also conducted reconnaissance against ICS VPN appliances on a Korean telecommunications company, a Korean marine vessel classification organization, and a Korean national research university. #### Broad Targeting of Panamanian Government Entities Between April 22 and April 24, 2025, Insikt Group observed a significant effort by RedNovember to scan and likely reconnoiter over 30 Panamanian organizations, the majority of which are related to the Panamanian government. Targeted devices and organizations included Panamaian government bodies focused on finance, international relations, and transportation. The targeting also included several other government ministries, including ones focused on land and economic development and emergency services organizations. The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s visit to Panama in early April 2025, and may have been triggered at least in part by several remarks made by US President Donald Trump during January and February 2025 that suggested US interest in asserting control over the Panama Canal. On April 9, 2025, Secretary Hegseth [announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an “expanded partnership” with Panama to counter Chinese influence in the canal. Additionally, in February 2025, following a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Panama President José Raúl Mulino [announced](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/02/04/panama-drops-belt-and-road-agreement-with-china-after-us-pressure_6737775_4.html) that the country would formally leave China’s flagship foreign development project Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), by not renewing the current Memorandum of Understanding, and that Panama would also [review](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/panama-said-to-mull-canceling-port-deal-with-hong-kong-firm) its contracts with Hong Kong firm Hutchison PPC, which currently manages Panama’s ports of Balboa and Cristóbal. An agreement on the sale involving the two ports to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock and MSC (Mediterranean Shipping Company), set to be signed during the first week of April 2025, had [reportedly](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-panama-canal-take-back-military-china-blackrock-rcna199438) been delayed under pressure from China. **_Figure 3:_** _Breakdown of RedNovember reconnaissance and compromise activity by country between June 2024 and May 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)_ #### Targeting of US and European Defense and Aerospace Organizations In July 2024, Insikt Group observed RedNovember conduct a broad reconnaissance campaign exclusively targeting prominent aerospace and defense organizations, with a particular focus on the US. This activity involved suspected port scanning from the RedNovember IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57_ against these networks. There was no evidence to suggest a successful compromise or exploitation took place against these entities. However, this activity demonstrated that RedNovember was expanding its targeting to include the US defense industrial base and other global defense organizations. In the first half of 2025, Insikt Group has observed further RedNovember reconnaissance activity and compromises targeting this sector. In April 2025, communications were observed between a RedNovember reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation server and infrastructure associated with a European space focused research center. As part of its April 2025 targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices, RedNovember targeted a specialized US engineering and military contractor. Insikt Group observed direct connections between the same RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 and exploitation server and two of the organization’s ICS VPN Internet-facing endpoints over a period of two days; however, there is currently no sufficient evidence to conclude that RedNovember succeeded in compromising the target. Also in April 2025, RedNovember conducted extensive reconnaissance against an IP address space associated with a higher education institution associated with the US Navy. Insikt Group did not observe evidence of the organization being compromised. #### Targeting of the Private Sector ##### European Manufacturing Companies In March 2025, Insikt Group identified direct reconnaissance and communications with RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2s that indicated RedNovember’s possible compromise of a European engine manufacturer. The threat group targeted a SonicWall VPN device and login pages for the company’s F5 BIG-IP devices and VDI environment. RedNovember also browsed to a server that hosts a SonicWall SonicOS and a SonicWall SSL VPN instance for a UK-based defense contractor. Additionally, also in March 2025, Insikt Group observed RedNovember-controlled IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]24_ browsing to a SonicWall SonicOS and SonicWall SSL-VPN instance of a United Kingdom (UK)-based company focusing on bespoke cable harnessing, including for aerospace, military and defense, and medical applications. ##### Law Firms (Globally) The group compromised a SonicWall SonicOS and SSL VPN device belonging to an American law firm in April 2025. RedNovember also targeted IP addresses, including a Palo Alto GlobalProtect Gateway Httpd sever, associated with a global law firm that has been involved in a debt restructuring project with a Chinese company. ##### Taiwanese Technology Companies Between at least July 2024 and March 2025, RedNovember compromised a Taiwanese IT company using the Pantegana C2 IP addresses _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]57\\[.\\]116_ and _205\\[.\\]185\\[.\\]126\\[.\\]208_. RedNovember has shown particular interest in Taiwanese companies, particularly ones related to semiconductors and technology, as well as Taiwanese government bodies related to science. ##### US Oil and Gas Companies In April 2025, RedNovember conducted reconnaissance of two American oil and gas companies. Insikt Group had previously publicly [reported](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign) on RedNovember targeting American utilities organizations in 2024, in the context of a campaign targeting Palo Alto GlobalProtect devices. #### Broad Targeting of Fijian Government, Financial, Transportation, and Media Entities In July 2024, Insikt Group identified a surge in RedNovember activity targeting over 50 Fijian organizations via the actor-controlled IP addresses _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57_ and _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]47\\[.\\]6_. This activity exclusively targeted OWA and Sophos UTM login portals of these organizations. Notable targets included multiple Fijian financial institutions, transportation authorities, media, and government organizations. In particular, the identified targeting of multiple land, sea, and air transportation authorities aligns with ongoing Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) interests within Fiji ( [1](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3243118/fiji-woos-china-upgrade-strategically-important-ports-even-debt-concerns-mount), [2](https://fijionenews.com.fj/fiji-enters-into-300m-china-bri-deal/)), exemplifying RedNovember activity correlating with Chinese state interests. #### Surge Targeting of Edge Devices and Vulnerability Exploitation RedNovember has repeatedly conducted surge targeting of specific edge devices following the disclosure of vulnerabilities and the publication of PoC exploit code for those same devices. Insikt Group has also observed evidence that the group has targeted the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) and a Microsoft Exchange server. RedNovember has a history of targeting vulnerabilities in edge devices. In April 2024, following the release of a PoC exploit for the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability CVE-2024-3400, the group likely [conducted](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign) reconnaissance and exploitation activity against Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect appliances associated with American education, finance, legal, local government, and utilities organizations. ##### Targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure VPN in April 2025 In April 2025, RedNovember conducted a campaign focused on the reconnaissance and targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices across multiple countries. Specific targets included a major American newspaper, a specialized US engineering and military contractor, and two prominent Korean institutes associated with scientific research and nuclear regulation. ##### Likely Targeting of Check Point VPN Gateways Following CVE-2024-24919 PoC Publication From June 3 to June 6, 2024, Insikt Group observed outbound communications from RedNovember IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]47\\[.\\]6_ to Check Point VPN gateways linked to at least 60 organizations, mainly in Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the US (see **Figure 4**). This activity appeared relatively opportunistic, with minimal themes identified across targeted organizations. Notably, on May 30, 2024, a PoC exploit was [published](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/) for the arbitrary file read vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 affecting multiple Check Point VPN gateway products, which led to widespread [exploitation](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/whats-going-on-with-checkpoint-cve-2024-24919) in the wild by multiple threat actors. While unconfirmed, the timing of the RedNovember activity suggests that the group may have attempted to exploit this vulnerability following the publication of this PoC. Similar behavior by RedNovember was previously noted concerning the targeting of Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, which closely aligned with the release of a public PoC for the arbitrary file creation vulnerability CVE-2024-3400. **_Figure 4:_** _Breakdown of RedNovember Check Point VPN targeting by country in early June 2024_ _(Source: Recorded Future)_ ### Tools Used by RedNovember #### LESLIELOADER and SparkRAT Insikt Group identified two LESLIELOADER samples used by RedNovember to load SparkRAT. The group has previously used a variant of the [publicly available](https://github.com/HZzz2/go-shellcode-loader) Go-based loader LESLIELOADER to load SparkRAT, including in a chain documented by Kroll [research](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/leslieloader-undocumented-loader-observed?) in March 2024. **SHA256 Hash** **SparkRAT C2 IP Address** `8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d` 209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57 `06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2` 107\\[.\\]189\\[.\\]8\\[.\\]240 **_Table 1:_** _RedNovember LESLIELOADER samples used to load SparkRAT (Source: Recorded Future)_ The 06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2 sample was first uploaded to a public malware repository within a ZIP file (SHA256: 675874ac8fbe66e76244759ae398a4d30da84ef2435a1384c4be549ca9eba18b), which also contained a PDF lure document (SHA256: 1e37efcd3cd647e6ce5414ae8e353ca690c2d3f7a701a1cc2ec29a4813f5c90b). The PDF lure, which was highly likely delivered via email-based spearphishing, purported to come from the IT department of a US Navy contractor company, and directed targets receiving the file to download and install the LESLIELOADER sample from the threat actor-controlled malicious domain _download\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg_. The LESLIELOADER executable masqueraded as a security patch for VMware software, and its filename included the specific name of the US contractor company being targeted. #### LESLIELOADER and Cobalt Strike In May 2025, Insikt Group identified two additional samples of LESLIELOADER used to load Cobalt Strike Beacon in memory. **SHA256 Hash** **Cobalt Strike C2 IP Address** `134ed0407956ff1ac59f38e89742e357cc3be565cbaff18b424ed1bcfd130978` 47\\[.\\]103\\[.\\]218\\[.\\]35 `2bee2cc42322e928bfa0650c5416b14bc0200f2d1156304179d63982baa835dc` **_Table 2:_** _RedNovember LESLIELOADER samples used to load Cobalt Strike (Source: Recorded Future)_ Notably, in this case, the server was hosted in China, specifically on ALIBABA-CN-NET (AS37963), and the Cobalt Strike service was run on TCP port 80. #### Additional Malicious Documents Insikt Group also identified a malicious Word document directing victims to the RedNovember-controlled domain _login\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg_ (SHA256: 9a1077f57bac5610d44ac46a8958dd5469522a3db466f164f4dfeada73847b79), specifically to the URL: _hxxps://login\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg/ms-help.html._ The subdomain name “offiec” could be a typosquat reference to the Microsoft Office suite. The file was last modified on August 14, 2024, and was first submitted to a public malware scanner on August 15, 2024. The `ms-help.html` file (SHA256: dba860617762bc713771de351026eb683546b37489fa0359064948f263438030) downloaded by the Word document appears to have been an exploit for the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-3019). #### Other Potential Tools Insikt Group has observed RedNovember using multiple file-sharing websites and tools to scan for vulnerabilities. **pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk** In October 2024, Insikt Group observed connections between a RedNovember server and the website _pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk_, an anonymous file-sharing website. This website has been previously [highlighted](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-post-exploitation-lateral-movement) by Mandiant as being used by a suspected China-based threat actor, UNC5266, as part of an exploitation campaign targeting Ivanti devices in 2024. UNC5266 allegedly used the file-sharing website to stage malware payloads and attempted to retrieve them through `curl` and `wget` requests to specific URL paths on the website. Insikt Group does not currently have evidence to substantiate any links between UNC5266 and RedNovember. Since at least January 23, 2025, and as of July 22, 2025, the domain’s landing page displays a Chinese-language message which in translation reads as: “Statement on the abuse of ‘pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk’ by cyber attackers.” The statement acknowledges that recent public reporting has highlighted suspect misuse of the platform by cyber threat actors, stating that it has no connection to such incidents and that it abides by applicable laws and regulations. According to the statement, the platform is temporarily unavailable while work is being conducted to “optimize the download logic and add authentication verification.” **_Figure 5:_** _Statement on the pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk main page (Source: urlscan.io)_ **PortSwigger** RedNovember connected on multiple occasions to the PortSwigger website. PortSwigger provides tools for web application security testing and scanning. Its main product, Burp Suite, is widely used by security researchers — and, occasionally, by threat actors — to test and scan web applications for vulnerabilities. **Filemail** RedNovember connected to a dedicated Filemail instance with a domain of _3008\\[.\\]filemail\\[.\\]com_. Filemail is a cloud-based file transfer service solution that allows users to upload, send, and share large files via email or shareable links. **Acunetix** In at least one instance, a RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 server ran the vulnerability scanner tool Acunetix, suggesting that the threat group may also be using this tool as part of its reconnaissance activity. **Hacker Target** RedNovember used one of its servers to access the _hackertarget\\[.\\]com_ website in April 2025. Hacker Target provides a free online vulnerability scanner platform with multiple features, including Nmap and ZMap scans, and domain and server profiling. **Wayback Machine** In April 2025, RedNovember used at least two of its servers to navigate to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Insikt Group did not have visibility into what the threat group queried in the archive. **Crt\\[.\\]sh** Also in April 2025, RedNovember accessed _crt\\[.\\]sh_, a free online TLS certificate transparency service that allows users to look up TLS certificate logs by domain or certificate hash. **Gofile\\[.\\]io** Additionally, in April 2025, RedNovember connected to the free cloud storage service _gofile\\[.\\]io_, suggesting that the threat actor might have uploaded or browsed files from an account it held on the platform. As highlighted above, RedNovember has previously used similar services, such as the aforementioned _pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk_. ## Mitigations Organizations should take the following measures to detect and mitigate observed TTPs associated with RedNovember activity: - Detect and block malicious infrastructure such as Pantegana, SparkRAT, and Cobalt Strike C2 servers in real time via the [Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence) module. - [Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence) module users can monitor real-time output to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity involving key vendors and partners within physical, network, and software supply chains. - By monitoring Infrastructure Analysis events, Recorded Future customers can alert on and monitor RedNovember C2 IP addresses. - By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future customers can alert on and proactively monitor infrastructure involved in notable communication to known RedNovember C2 IP addresses. - Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those exploited in the wild as determined through the [Recorded Future® Vulnerability Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence) module. The public availability of exploit code can substantially increase the likelihood of mass exploitation ( [1](https://www.securityweek.com/poc-published-fortinet-vulnerability-mass-exploitation-attempts-begin/), [2](https://www.securityweek.com/exploitation-of-palo-alto-firewall-vulnerability-picking-up-after-poc-release/), [3](https://www.securityweek.com/mass-exploitation-of-citrix-bleed-vulnerability-underway/)). To specifically protect against some Chinese state-sponsored groups, pay particular attention to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in external-facing appliances within your environment. - Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking connection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains linked in **Appendix A**. - Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities are in place for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor for follow-on activity likely to occur following exploitation of these external-facing services, such as the deployment of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells, as well as subsequent lateral movement to internal networks. - Regularly audit internet-facing and perimeter appliances, and reduce attack surfaces by disabling both internet-facing and internal interfaces or portals where no longer required, and by reducing appliances exposed to the internet to only those that are strictly required. - Consider logging capabilities and security product support when initially procuring network appliances, in order to be appropriately positioned to detect and respond to threats. - Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information; consider implementing multi-factor authentication and extremely restricted access and storage on systems only accessible via an internal network. - Focus on defense-in-depth strategies, such as detecting post-exploitation persistence, discovery, and lateral movement activities, as well as unusual network communications. Such strategies can aid detection and response to intrusions arising from the exploitation of both known and zero-day vulnerabilities. ## Outlook RedNovember has historically targeted a diverse range of countries and sectors, suggesting broad and changing intelligence requirements. Some of its activity appears to align with a military affiliation or military-adjacent interests, such as the targeting of specific entities in the US DIB, or the targeting of Taiwan around the time of China’s military exercises in Taiwan. However, there are different sets of targeting that do not closely match this pattern: for example, the targeting of law firms, newspaper organizations, and a Christian denomination in the US. Other clusters of RedNovember activity signal a clear interest in foreign governments and foreign policy, such as the targeting of international multilateral organizations based in Southeast Asia and government ministries in several Southeast Asian countries and South American countries, as well as the reconnaissance against dozens of Panamanian government departments in April 2025. Based on its visibility and collection, Insikt Group has observed that RedNovember’s activity to date has primarily focused on several key geographies, including the US, Southeast Asia, the Pacific region, and South America. While targets and victims have also been identified in Europe and at least one in Africa, the overall volume of activity directed toward these areas has been notably lower than that observed in the primary regions of focus. From a sector perspective, RedNovember continued targeting government organizations in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South America, intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia, and religious organizations. However, since our first public report on the group, we have also observed RedNovember expand its targeting to defense and aerospace organizations, the private sector, and at least two news outlets. Insikt Group anticipates that RedNovember, along with other Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups, will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release. ## Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise ``` Domains: aeifile[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg citrix[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg cna[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg download[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg gp[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg login[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg test[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg vpn[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg vpn1[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg RedNovember Pantegana C2 IP Addresses: 45[.]61[.]187[.]124 198[.]98[.]50[.]218 198[.]98[.]53[.]163 198[.]98[.]61[.]155 209[.]141[.]37[.]254 205[.]185[.]126[.]208 205[.]185[.]124[.]24 209[.]141[.]42[.]131 209[.]141[.]46[.]83 209[.]141[.]57[.]116 RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 IP Address: 47[.]103[.]218[.]35 RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 URLs: hxxp://47[.]103[.]218[.]35/pixel hxxp://47[.]103[.]218[.]35/GSjY LESLIELOADER SHA256 hashes: 06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2 134ed0407956ff1ac59f38e89742e357cc3be565cbaff18b424ed1bcfd130978 2bee2cc42322e928bfa0650c5416b14bc0200f2d1156304179d63982baa835dc 8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d ZIP file SHA256 hash: 675874ac8fbe66e76244759ae398a4d30da84ef2435a1384c4be549ca9eba18b PDF lure SHA256 hash: 1e37efcd3cd647e6ce5414ae8e353ca690c2d3f7a701a1cc2ec29a4813f5c90b Malicious Follina Word document SHA256 hashes: 9a1077f57bac5610d44ac46a8958dd5469522a3db466f164f4dfeada73847b79 dba860617762bc713771de351026eb683546b37489fa0359064948f263438030 ``` ## Appendix B: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques **Tactic: Technique** **ATT&CK Code** **Resource Development:** Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server [T1583.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003/) **Reconnaissance:** Gather Victim Network Information: Network Security Appliances [T1590.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/006/) **Initial Access:** Exploit Public-Facing Application [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/) **Execution:** User Execution: Malicious Link [T1204.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001/) **Execution:** User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/) **Command and Control:** Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols [T1071.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/) **Command and Control:** Non-Standard Port [T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571/) ## Appendix C: LESLIELOADER YARA Rule ``` rule MAL_LESLIELOADER { meta: author = \"Insikt Group, Recorded Future\" date = \"2024-11-14\" description = \"Detects LESLIELOADER Malware used by RedNovember\" version = \"1.0\" hash = \"8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d\" hash = \"06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2\" malware = \"LESLIELOADER\" malware_id = \"u-6JwI\" category = \"MALWARE\" strings: $s1 = \".DecrptogAES\" $s2 = \".UnPaddingText1\" // AES key 1 $k1a = \"LeslieCh\" $k1b = \"eungKwok\" // AES key 2 $k2a = { 33 44 37 35 45 34 43 39 } $k2b = { 42 33 32 41 42 45 31 37 } condition: uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and all of ($s*) and 2 of ($k*) } ``` ## Appendix D: RedNovember Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis",

It brings together the commodity, policy and country expertise of both organisations and input from collaborating member countries to provide an annual assessment of prospects for the coming decade of national, regional and global agricultural commodity markets. The Agricultural Outlook is prepared jointly by the OECD and FAO Secretariats. At the OECD, the baseline projections and Outlook report were prepared by members of the Trade and Agriculture Directorate: Marcel Adenäuer, Annelies Deuss, Armelle Elasri (publication co-ordinator), Hubertus Gay (Outlook co-ordinator), Céline Giner, Gaëlle Gouarin, Tomoo Higuchi, Lee Ann Jackson (Head of Division), Edith Laget, Claude Nénert, Daniela Rodriguez Niño, and Grégoire Tallard of the Agro\u0002Food Trade and Markets Division, and for fish and seafood by Claire Delpeuch and Will Symes of the Agricultural Resources Policy Division. The partial stochastic modelling builds on work by the Economics of Agriculture Unit of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The organisation of meetings and publication preparation were provided by Caitlin Boros, Edmund Linton, Catalina Mas, and Michèle Patterson. Wilfrid Legg provided language review for the publication. Technical assistance in the preparation of the Outlook database was provided by Karine Lepron, Marc Regnier and Eric Espinasse. Many other colleagues in the OECD Secretariat and member country delegations provided useful comments on earlier drafts of the report. At the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the baseline projections and Outlook report were prepared by members of the Markets and Trade Division (EST) under the leadership of Boubaker Ben-Belhassen (EST Division Director), with the overall guidance of Máximo Torero (FAO Chief Economist) and by the Economic and Social Development Stream Management team. The core projections team consisted of: Sabine Altendorf, Sergio René Araujo Enciso, Giulia Caddeo, André Croppenstedt, Holger Matthey (Team Leader), Svetlana Mladenovic, Sabina Tuspayeva and Irmak Yaka. For fish, the team consisted of Pierre Charlebois, Adrienne Egger, and Stefania Vannuccini from the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Division. Advice on fishmeal and fish oil issues and historical data were provided by Enrico Bachis from the Marine Ingredients Organisation (IFFO). Macroeconomic projections benefited from the input by Oxford Economics. The sugar and cotton sections were contributed by Mamoun Amrouk and Fabio Palmeri, with data and technical advice by Lorena Ruiz from the International Cotton Advisory Committee(ICAC). The section on bananas and major tropical fruits was prepared by Sabine Altendorf, Giuseppe Bonavita and Pascal Liu. Carola Fabi, Salar Tayyib and Francesco Tubiello advised on FAOSTAT data. Commodity expertise was provided by Erin Collier, Shirley Mustafa, G.A. Upali Wickramasinghe, and Di Yang. Marion Delport and Jodie Hattingh from the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) contributed material and expertise to Box 1.1. Research assistance and database preparation were provided by David Bedford, Harout Dekermendjian, Annamaria Giusti, Grace Maria Karumathy, Yanyun Li, Lavinia Lucarelli, Emanuele Marocco, and Marco Milo. This edition also benefited from comments made by various colleagues from FAO and member country institutions.

The report is a collaborative effort between the OECD and FAO, prepared with inputs from Member countries and international commodity organisations. The surge in agricultural input prices experienced over the last two years has raised concerns about global food security. This year’s Outlook demonstrates that rising fertiliser costs can lead to higher food prices. The OECD-FAO Aglink-Cosimo modelling of production yields allows at present to separate the costs of the main mineral fertilisers used from those of other production inputs. Based on this new feature, a scenario analysis estimates that for each 1% increase in fertiliser prices, agricultural commodity prices would increase by 0.2%. The increase would be more significant for crops that use fertilisers as direct inputs than for livestock products that use them indirectly, with the exception of poultry and pigmeat production which relies heavily on compound feed. Although this scenario focuses on the link between fertilisers and agricultural commodities, fluctuations in energy, seeds, labour and machinery prices would also affect food prices. This year’s Outlook provides improved estimates for food consumption by incorporating analytical methods to calculate food loss and waste. They contribute to the measurement efforts needed to devise evidence\u0002based policies in support of the SDG 12.3 target to halve per capita food waste at the retail and consumer levels, and to reduce food losses within production and supply chains by 2030. Baseline projections in this Outlook for the coming decade take into account the IMF World Economic Outlook October 2022 downgrade in expected average economic growth for the coming decade, from 2.7% to 2.6%, as well as the decrease in the People’s Republic of China’s (hereafter “China”) population as of 2022. Similar to last year’s assumptions, the current baseline projections assume that energy prices will decrease in 2023 before resuming a slow increase to 2032. The projections incorporate short-term assessments of the impact of the [Russian Federation’s (hereafter “Russia”) war against Ukraine (hereinafter referred to as “war”), but no evaluation of medium-term developments in the region can be provided at this time. Against this backdrop, the global projections of medium-term trends for supply, demand, trade, and prices for the main agricultural commodities and fish deviate only marginally from last year’s projections. Nevertheless, the war continues to add uncertainties to food, energy, and input prices. At the onset of the war, reduced availability of grains and fertilisers were a major concern for global markets. A year later, supply issues have improved thanks to the enforcement and subsequent extensions of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. In this context, global food consumption in calories – the main use of agricultural commodities – is projected to increase by 1.3% per year over the next decade, a slower pace than the previous decade due to the foreseen slowdown in population and per capita income growth. The second most important use of agricultural commodities is as feed for livestock and increasingly aquaculture. The Outlook highlights the rapid expansion and intensification that is expected in the production of livestock in low- and middle-income 18  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 countries, resulting in a fast-growing demand for feed over the next decade. In contrast, in high-income countries and some upper middle-income countries, including China, lower growth in livestock production and improved feeding efficiency should result in slower growth in feed demand compared to the last decade. Demand for first generation biofuel feedstocks is expected to grow slowly over the next ten years. Most additional biofuel use of agricultural crops is expected to occur in India and Indonesia, driven by increasing transport fuel use and higher biofuel blending requirements. In other key markets, e.g. European Union, the demand for first generation biofuel feedstocks is expected to decrease due to a decline in transport fuel use and a shift to other feedstocks. Overall, the biofuel share of global sugarcane and vegetable oil use is projected to increase, while the biofuel share of maize is expected to decline. The situation with respect to investments in technology, infrastructure, and training remains fundamentally unchanged from last year’s projections; as such, growth in total global agricultural production should remain at 1.1% per year. Most of this growth will occur in middle- and low-income countries. The Outlook assumes wider access to inputs, although if increases in energy and agricultural input prices (e.g. fertilisers) are to resume, this would raise production costs that could lead to food price inflation and greater food insecurity. Global crop production growth will mainly be driven by increased productivity rather than increased land use. Therefore, investments in raising yields and improved farm management are essential. Assuming continued progress in plant breeding and a transition to more intensive production systems, yield improvements are projected to account for 79% of global crop production growth, cropland expansion for 15%, and higher cropping intensity for 6% over the Outlook period. Yields for crops such as oil palm and rapeseed have not increased, however, in major producing countries over the last ten years; more investments are needed to improve the productivity of these crops. Similar to trends in crop production, a large share of the projected 1.3% annual growth in livestock and fish production will result from improvements in per animal productivity resulting from more efficient herd management and higher feed intensity. Poultry is projected to account for about half of the global growth in meat production due to sustained profitability and favourable meat-to-feed price ratios. Pigmeat production is still recovering from the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in East Asia and is projected to resume a pre-crisis growth path in a few years. Global milk production is projected to grow strongly in the coming decade, with half of this growth occurring in India and Pakistan. Despite its limited growth prospects, aquaculture overtook the global production volume of capture fisheries in 2022. The Outlook highlights the significance of global agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are projected to increase by 7.6% in the next decade. At the global level, growth in GHG emissions will be lower than in the previous decade, and lower than the projected 12.8% growth in agricultural output, indicating a faster decline in the carbon intensity of agricultural production. Nevertheless, pioneering efforts need to be widely adopted to ensure that agriculture contributes effectively to climate change mitigation, as set out in the Paris Agreement, especially for livestock which is estimated to account for 80% of the increase in agricultural GHG emissions. At the same time, agricultural production systems face the challenge to adapt to a changing climate, including more frequent and intense extreme weather events. Mitigation and adaption solutions include large-scale and inclusive adoption of climate-smart and carbon\u0002neutral production processes and technologies. Trade in primary agricultural commodities and processed products is projected to grow in line with production over the next decade. The COVID-19 pandemic led to worldwide disruptions in commerce, but trade in the agricultural commodities has proven to be resilient. Russia’s war against Ukraine has been impacting agricultural commodity trade, especially Ukrainian exports, and prices. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, agreed to in July 2022, and the European Union–Ukraine Solidarity Lanes have helped, however, to re-establish trade to support global food security. The baseline projections underscore the critical importance of a well-functioning, transparent, and rules-based multilateral trading system. Export bans  19 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 only aggravate the adverse effect of price uncertainties and increase prices. This results not only in a negative impact on global food security (and livelihoods) in the short term, but undermines supply capacity over the long term. The medium-term projections in the Outlook are based on the assumption that current policies will remain in place, and that consumer preferences and production technology will evolve on-trend. These assumptions are subject to uncertainties with respect to environmental, social, geopolitical and economic developments, e.g. a prolonged period of high inflation or a global recession would alter the projections. The scenario analysis presented in this report provides indications as to the magnitude of such impacts. 20  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 This chapter presents the trends and prospects of the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2023-2032 derived from the medium-term projections of the most globally produced, consumed and traded agricultural and fish commodities. Following a description of the macroeconomic and policy assumptions underlying the projections, it highlights the key findings for the consumption, production, trade, and prices of those commodities for the period 2023 to 2032. Agricultural demand is projected to grow more slowly over the coming decade due to the foreseen slowdown in population and per capita income growth. Production of agricultural commodities is also projected to grow at a slower pace. The reduced growth incentives are not only driven by a weakening global demand for agricultural products but by decelerating productivity growth resulting from increased input prices, notably fertilisers, and tightening of environmental regulations. The expected developments in global demand and supply will keep real agricultural prices on a slightly declining trend over the next decade. International trade will remain essential for food security in food-importing countries and for the livelihoods of workers along the food supply chains in food-exporting countries. There is a growing risk that weather variability, animal and plant diseases, changing input prices, macro-economic developments, and other policy uncertainties will lead to deviations in market outcomes from the current projections. 1 Agricultural and food markets: Trends and prospects  21 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook is a collaborative effort of the Organisation for Economic Co\u0002operation and Development (OECD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). It presents a consistent baseline scenario for the evolution of agricultural commodity and fish markets at national, regional, and global levels for the period 2023 to 2032. This baseline scenario incorporates the commodity, policy, and country expertise of both organisations, as well as input from collaborating Member countries and international commodity bodies. The baseline projections are based on the OECD-FAO Aglink-Cosimo model, which links sectors and countries covered in the Outlook to ensure consistency and global equilibrium across all markets. The projections are influenced by current market conditions (summarised in Figure 1.1), as well as assumptions about macroeconomic, demographic, and policy developments, which are detailed in Section 1.1. The projections are based on a short-term assessment of the Russian Federation’s (hereafter “Russia”) war against Ukraine, no evaluation of medium-term market prospects in the region can be provided at this time. The baseline of the Outlook serves as a reference for forward-looking policy planning and the underlying Aglink-Cosimo model allows simulation analysis, including the assessment of market uncertainties. A detailed discussion of the methodology of the projections, as well as documentation of the Aglink-Cosimo model, are available online at www.agri-outlook.org. The Outlook contains four parts: • Part 1: Agricultural and food markets: Trends and prospects. Following the description of the macroeconomic and policy assumptions underlying the projections (Section 1.1), this chapter presents the main findings of the Outlook. It highlights key projections and provides insights into the main outcomes and challenges facing agri-food systems over the coming decade. The chapter presents trends and prospects for consumption (Section 1.2), production (Section 1.3), trade (Section 1.4), and prices (Section 1.5). • Part 2: Regional briefs. This chapter describes key trends and emerging issues facing the agricultural sector in the six FAO regions, i.e. Asia and Pacific, which is split into Developed and East Asia (Section 2.1) and South and Southeast Asia (Section 2.2), Sub-Saharan Africa (Section 2.3), Near East and North Africa (Section 2.4), Europe and Central Asia (Section 2.5), North America (Section 2.6), and Latin America and the Caribbean (Section 2.7). It highlights the regional aspects of production, consumption and trade projections and provides background information on key regional issues. • Part 3: Commodity chapters. These chapters describe recent market developments and highlight medium term projections for consumption, production, trade, and prices for the commodities covered in the Outlook. Each chapter concludes with a discussion of the main issues and uncertainties that might affect markets over the next ten years. This part consists of nine chapters: cereals (Chapter 3), oilseeds and oilseed products (Chapter 4), sugar (Chapter 5), meat (Chapter 6), dairy and dairy products (Chapter 7), fish (Chapter8), biofuels (Chapter 9), cotton (Chapter 10), and other products (Chapter 11). • Part 4: Statistical Annex. The statistical annex presents projections for production, consumption, trade, and prices for agricultural commodities, fish, and biofuels, as well as macroeconomic and policy assumptions. The evolution of markets over the outlook period is described using annual growth rates and data for the final year (2032) relative to a three-year base period (2020-22). The statistical annex is not part of the printed version of the Outlook but can be accessed online. 22  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.1. Market conditions for key commodities Meat: In 2022, international meat prices remained high, except for sheep meat, which saw a slight decline due to weakened import demand from China. However, various factors such as animal diseases, increasing input costs, and extreme weather conditions acted as obstacles to meat production growth. Despite these challenges, there was an overall expansion in meat production, mainly driven by increased output in Asia, notably a surge in pig meat production in China. Oilseed: International prices for oilseeds have dropped from the record highs observed in 2022 but remain above average levels of recent years. The price declines were chiefly underpinned by global output recoveries of soybean and rapeseed, despite sunflower seed production losses in Ukraine and reduced prospects for soybeans in Argentina. Global vegetable oil markets saw a steep decline in prices, mainly fueled by improving exportable supplies of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. Sugar: Global demand to increase in the current season, although at a slower pace due to slowing economic growth. Despite the recovery in Brazil, the main world sugar supplier, declining production prospects in other key exporters along with high input costs is likely to partly offset the overall downward pressure on international sugar prices. Current market conditions Production index Real Price Index Average 2013-2022 = 100 Average 2013-2022 = 100 Cereal: Global wheat production and stocks have increased, while production of maize and other coarse grains has not been sufficient to meet demand. Rice production was above-average level, while prices remain relatively high. Wheat and coarse grain prices in 2021/2022 were the highest recorded in the past 20 years, but began to fall in late July 2022 as an agreement was reached on the Black Sea Grain Initiative. 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Cereal Production 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Cereal Prices 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Oilseed Production 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Oilseed Prices 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Sugar Production 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 White sugar price 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Meat Production 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Meat Prices  23 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Note: All graphs expressed as an index where the average of the past decade (2013-2022) is set to 100.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/231495 Dairy: International dairy prices increased by 20% in 2022 but started to decline towards the end of 2022. Increasing input cost were one of the main drivers of price increase. Domestic prices often show a slightly different development as only a small share of milk is internationally traded. Milk production increased globally slower in 2022 than in previous years. World trade in dairy products declined, mainly due to lower imports by China. Fish: Fish: After a strong recovery in 2021, world fish consumption continued to expand in 2022 driven by the global economic recovery, while fish production rose only marginally. International fish prices, which had risen significantly in 2021, continued doing so in 2022 driven by increased demand and higher production costs, reaching levels just under the record highs of the early 1990s. Biofuels: In 2022, biofuels consumption increased, offsetting for the decrease that was caused by the drop of global transport fuel use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ethanol market nearly came back to levels witnessed in 2019. The biodiesel market recovered as well, but was less affected by the pandemic. Biofuels world prices increased owing to higher production costs of production. Cotton: In 2022, global consumption decreased in most of the major textile-producing countries as a consequence of economic uncertainty, inflation and high depreciation against US dollar. As a result, international prices dropped in the second half of 2022, after reaching an eleven-year high in May 2022. World cotton production slightly decreased mainly reflecting reduced outputs in the United States and Pakistan. 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Dairy Production 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Dairy Prices 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Fish Production 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Fish (traded) price 60 80 100 120 140 160 2020 2021 2022 Biofuel Production 60 80 100 120 140 160 2020 2021 2022 Biofuel Prices 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Cotton production 80 100 120 140 2020 2021 2022 Cotton Prices 24  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 1.1. Macroeconomic and policy assumptions 1.1.1. The main assumptions underlying the baseline projections This Outlook presents a consistent baseline scenario for the medium-term evolution of agricultural and fish commodity markets, based on a set of macro-economic, policy and demographic assumptions. The main assumptions underlying the projections are highlighted in this section. Detailed data are available in the Statistical Annex. 1.1.2. Population growth The Outlook uses the Medium Variant set of estimates from the United Nations Population Prospects database. Over the projection period, world population is expected to grow from 7.9 billion in 2022 to 8.6 billion people in 2032. This corresponds to an average annual growth rate of 0.8%, a slowdown compared to the 1.1% p.a. rate experienced over the last decade. Population growth is concentrated in low-income countries, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa which is expected to have the fastest growth at 2.4% p.a. over the coming decade. The population of the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”) declined for the first time in 2022 (according to the 2022 Revision of the United Nations Population Prospects)and is expected to decline further over the projection period to 1.41 billion inhabitants in 2032. With a population of 1.52 billion people in 2032, India is expected to overtake China in 2024 as the most populous country of the world. The populations of several European countries, Japan, and Korea are expected to decline during the projection period. Figure 1.2.

GDP growth and per capita income growth National GDP and per capita income estimates for the coming decade are based on the IMF World Economic Outlook (October 2022). Per capita incomes are expressed in constant 2010 United States dollars. Following a decline from 5.8% in 2021 to 3% in 2022, global GDP growth is expected to continue to slow down in 2023 and to stabilise at an average rate of 2.6% over the next decade. Over the period 2023-32, GDP will continue to grow the strongest in the Asia Pacific region, in particular in India, China and Southeast Asia. In Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Near East and North Africa, average GDP growth is projected to be higher than the global average, whereas that of Latin America and Caribbean and OECD countries is projected to be lower. National average per-capita income is approximated in this Outlook using per capita real GDP. This indicator is used to represent household disposable income, which is one of the main determinants of demand for agricultural commodities. As shown in the World Bank’s Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2022 report, national economic growth is unevenly distributed. This is particularly the case with Sub-Saharan countries, where the incomes of the poorest 40% of the population have lagged average income growth. For this reason, national average food demand projections in this Outlook can deviate from what might be expected based on average income growth. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened income inequalities within countries; the percentage income losses of the poorest are estimated to be double those of the richest, thereby delaying access to high-value food products for the poorest populations whose primary source of calories is derived from staples. After a recovery in 2021, global per capita income growth was 2% p.a. in 2022 and is expected to weaken in 2023 to 1% p.a. Over the next decade, an average annual growth rate of 1.7% p.a. in real terms is projected. Strong per capita income growth is expected in Asia, especially in Viet Nam (5.6% p.a.), India (5% p.a.), China (4.7% p.a.), the Philippines (4.5% p.a.), Indonesia (4% p.a.), and Thailand (3% p.a.). In Sub-Saharan Africa, average per capita incomes are projected to grow slowly at 1.1% p.a. over the coming decade. Strong population growth limits the real per capita income increase in Sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia is expected to experience robust growth at 4% p.a. due to a very low base and increasing economic stability. In Latin America and the Caribbean, average per capita income growth is projected at 1.6% p.a., with smaller regional variations. In the Near East and North Africa region, average per capita income growth is projected at 1.7% p.a., led by the Near East region and Egypt. In OECD countries, per capita income is projected to increase on average at around 1.4% p.a. Figure 1.3 decomposes the GDP growth projections into per capita GDP and population growth for key regions and selected countries. Globally, economic growth will be mainly driven by per capita income growth. This is especially the case in OECD countries and China. By contrast, high population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa means that the relatively high rate of economic growth in the region (3.6% p.a.) corresponds to only a modest growth in per capita terms (at around 1.1% p.a.). The same applies to a lesser extent to the Near East and North Africa region. The modest economic growth in Europe at 1.5% p.a., where the population is expected to decrease over the next ten years, translates into a per capita income growth rate of 1.7% p.a. over the coming decade. 26  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.3.

Exchange rates and inflation Exchange rate assumptions are based on the IMF World Economic Outlook (October 2022).

A very strong real appreciation is also expected in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Ukraine, whereas a real depreciation is expected for South Africa, Japan, Korea, Norway, Australia, China, and the European Union. Inflation projections are based on the private consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator from the IMF World Economic Outlook (October 2022). Despite high inflation rates in all countries in 2022, projected rates are expected to slow down in 2023 and over the next ten years through tighter monetary policies. In OECD countries, following an inflation rate of 13% in 2022, this is projected to ease at 4.4% p.a. over the coming decade, with an annual inflation rate of 2% p.a. for the United States, 2% p.a. for Canada, and 2.1% p.a. for the Euro zone. Among emerging economies, consumer price inflation is expected to remain high at 10.3% p.a. in Türkiye and 9.1% p.a. in Argentina, despite a strong decrease compared to the previous decade. Inflation should ease in India, from 4.8% p.a. to 3.8% p.a. and in Brazil, from 5.9% p.a. to 3.1% p.a. By contrast, China should experience the same rate of consumer price inflation (2% p.a.) as over the last decade. Inflation is projected to remain high in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia (12.6% p.a.), Nigeria (9.5% p.a.) and Ghana (6.9% p.a.). High inflation is also expected in Egypt (6.5% p.a.) and Pakistan (6.5% p.a.). 1.1.5. Input costs Production projections in the Outlook incorporate a composite cost index which covers seeds and energy, as well as various other tradable and non-tradable inputs. It is based on historical cost shares for each country and commodity, and which are held constant for the duration of the outlook period. Energy costs are represented by the international crude oil price expressed in domestic currency. Costs of tradable inputs such as machinery and chemicals are approximated by the evolution of the real exchange rate, while the costs of non-tradable inputs (mainly labour) are approximated by the progress of the GDP deflator. Seed prices follow respective crop prices. Fertiliser costs, which are not included in the composite cost index, are explicit in yield and land allocation equations. Three fertiliser types are distinguished: nitrate, phosphate, and potassium. The quantities applied to single crops are decision variables, while prices are linked to crop and crude oil prices. Historical data for world oil prices are based on Brent crude oil prices in 2021, taken from the short-term update of the OECD Economic Outlook N°112 (December 2022). For 2022, the annual average daily spot price in 2022 was used, while the December average daily spot price is used for 2023. For the remainder of the projection period, the reference oil price used in the projections is assumed to remain constant in real terms. After a decrease from USD 98/barrel in 2022 to USD 82/barrel in 2023 (USD 77/barrel and USD 63/barrel respectively in real terms), the oil price is assumed to increase to USD 98/barrel in nominal terms and USD 63/barrel in real terms in 2032. 1.1.6. Policy Policies play a significant role in agricultural, biofuel, and fisheries markets, and policy reforms may therefore trigger changes in market structures. The Outlook assumes that policies currently in place will remain unchanged throughout the projection period, thus providing a useful benchmark for the evaluation and analysis of future policy changes. The projections of the Outlook take into account the reform of the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) ‒ which came into force at the beginning of 2023 ‒ as EU Member States have submitted their CAP strategic plans to the Commission. However, several policy initiatives, notably under the European Green Deal and in particular the targets of the Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies and for which legislation is in preparation, are not reflected in the baseline because their objectives have not yet been quantified in detail. Therefore, in the case of the EU, only free trade agreements that had been ratified up to the end of September 2022 are considered, while others (e.g. EU-Mercosur) are pending. 28  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The relationship between the EU-27 and the United Kingdom (UK) is based on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement provisionally applied from 1 January 2021. A duty-free/quota-free trade relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom is assumed. The free trade agreements considered in the Outlook for regions other than the European Union are those ratified by the end of December 2022 (e.g. Association of Southeast Asian Nations, United States-Mexico\u0002Canada Agreement (USMCA), African Continental Free Trade Area, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). The United States Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which includes funds for agriculture-related programs, is not considered in its entirety in the Outlook because the implementation of many provisions will not be effective immediately. However, the model considers the fact that the IRA has extended and increased production targets already in place in 2022 for renewable fuel programs and biomass-based diesel tax credits at both the state and federal levels. 1.2. Consumption The Outlook projects future trends in the use of the main crop commodities (cereals, oilseeds, roots and tubers, pulses, sugar cane and sugar beet, palm oil and cotton), livestock products (meat, dairy, eggs, and fish),1 and their by-products2 as food, animal feed, raw materials for biofuels and other industrial uses. The demand for food and non-food uses of agricultural commodities and their changing components is projected based on an assessment of the main driving factors: population dynamics, disposable incomes, prices, consumer preferences and policies. The baseline thereby covers the final use of minimally processed crops, but also includes first level processing, such as the crush of oilseeds and the subsequent use of the derived products as food, feed and biofuel. Accounting for direct feed use of cereals, as well as the use of processed products such as protein meal, fishmeal, cereal bran, and other by-products in the livestock sector allows the Outlook to identify the sector’s net contribution to human nutrition and to gauge the potential impact of developments on global food and nutrition security. 1.2.1. Population and income growth remain key drivers of demand for agricultural commodities Over the decade to 2032, the evolving energy and nutrition requirements of a growing and increasingly affluent global population are expected to be the key drivers of demand for agricultural commodities. The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the projections suggest a slowdown in global population growth alongside a decline in the population of China. Meanwhile, global economic growth will result in per capita income growth in most parts of the world. Projected rates of inflation are expected to slow down in 2023 and over the next ten years. However, economic developments and their respective impacts will vary by country. Furthermore, while global reference prices are expected to decline slightly in real terms, there is uncertainty how international price signals will transmit to domestic consumer prices and thereby impact demand at the local level. In addition, diverging population dynamics in different countries and regions, income-driven divergences in consumer preferences, and rapid urbanisation in many emerging economies will mean that consumption trends will also vary by country and region. Policy developments and social factors, alongside risks and uncertainties, are similarly likely to affect consumption to differing extents and outcomes at the local level, most importantly as income growth and distribution will continue to remain uneven across and within regions and countries. For example, in low-income countries where the share of food in household expenditures is high, income and food price shocks will have disproportionately larger consequences for consumption than in high-income countries. Preferences shaped by local culture and tradition will continue to lead to differences in demand for agricultural commodities among different regions and income classifications. Health and sustainability concerns are expected to increasingly shape the demand for food in affluent and emerging regions.  29 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Food remains the primary use for basic agricultural crop commodities, currently accounting for 49% of quantities consumed at the global level. However, in recent decades feed and fuel uses have gained in importance. Prominently, growth in the global production of animal products has necessitated a substantially higher allocation of crops to feed, which currently accounts for 26% of total global use. Biofuels and industrial applications, meanwhile, currently consume an estimated 8% of global agricultural crop output. Amidst a globally rising production of animal products over the Outlook period 2023-2032, growth in the non-food use of crops is expected to continue to outpace growth in food use, due to intensifying livestock practices and increasing demand for biofuel. Growth in feed use will be particularly pronounced in maize and oilseeds, the two foremost feed components (Figure 1.5). Figure 1.5. Global use of major commodities Note: Crushing of oilseeds is not reported as the uses of 'vegetable oil' and 'protein meal' are included in the total; Dairy refers to all dairy products in milk solid equivalent units; Sugar biofuel use refers to sugarcane and sugar beet, converted into sugar equivalent units.

Geographic differences in using agricultural commodities The use of agricultural commodities varies substantially by country and region (Figure 1.6). Most strikingly, the share of food use in Sub-Saharan Africa has remained above that of all other world regions, accounting for 69% of total use of agricultural commodities at present. This share is predicted to rise to 71% by the end of the Outlook period, as population growth is expected to have a larger effect on agricultural commodity demand than income growth, resulting in a larger expansion in the consumption of staple foods than of animal products across the region. At the other end of the spectrum is the distribution of agricultural commodities in North America, where food accounts for only 26% of total use, less than the share of feed or biofuels. The size as well as the feed-intensive production technology of the region’s livestock sector require a high use of agricultural commodities as feed. Increases in the feed use of agricultural commodities are also expected in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Near East and North Africa regions over the Outlook period, in part due to growth in production to satisfy the income-driven growth in the domestic consumption of animal products, but more importantly due to meat export growth. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 Maize Other coarse grains Rice Wheat Oilseeds and products Pulses Roots and tubers Meat Dairy Fish Sugar Mt Food Feed Biofuel Other uses 30  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.6.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/tz8l1j 1.2.3. Key drivers of food demand for agricultural commodities Under the baseline assumptions, population growth will continue to be the main factor shaping food demand at the global level, driven predominantly by the increasing consumption requirements of rising populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, India and the Near East and North Africa region. The projected developments in the global use of staples and fish will primarily be determined by population growth, while consumption growth of higher value products, especially fresh dairy, meat, and sugar will to large extent be fuelled by income-driven growth in per capita consumption (Figure 1.7). However, based on demographic and economic projections, global consumption of agricultural commodities, with the exception of sugar, is expected to expand less rapidly over the Outlook period than over the previous decade.

Global outlook for food use of agricultural commodities Due to the increase of the global population as well as gains in per capita income in all regions, total consumption of the food commodities covered in this Outlook is expected to rise by 15%. Overall, Asia will continue to play the most significant role in shaping global demand for food over the outlook period (Figure 1.9). The projected population increase in India as well as significant growth in per capita incomes in both India and China are expected to contribute significantly to growth in the consumption of all food commodities covered in the Outlook. Global consumption of staples, the most significant source of calories, is expected to increase by 4% from the base period and account for just over half of total global food consumption in 2032, as measured in terms of daily per capita calorie availability (Figure 1.8). Since demand for staple foods is predominantly driven by population growth, the largest expansion in the consumption of staples is expected to take place in regions with the highest expected population growth. As such, the global consumption of staples will increase most importantly in Asia (lead by India), Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Near East and North Africa region. However, globally, the growth of overall cereal demand, the most important staple, is expected to be slower over the next decade than it was in the past decade due to slowing growth in feed demand, biofuels, and other industrial uses. Moreover, in many countries direct human per capita food consumption of most cereals is approaching saturation levels, thus constraining gains in overall demand. Particularly in North America and Western Europe, per capita food use of cereals is expected to be stagnant, or even declining, due to low population growth and consumer preferences moving away from staple commodities.

India will account for most of the consumption growth for fresh dairy products and an important share of additional consumption of vegetable oil and sugar. In North America and Europe, income growth will similarly reduce per capita demand for basic foodstuffs, in particular for cereals, and thus facilitate a shift in consumption towards foods of higher nutritional value, most importantly in items that are dense in micronutrients such as fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts.

The consumption projections reflect varying developments in per capita incomes and their respective impact on food consumption patterns (Figure 1.10). As income rises, food consumption of the various food groups tends to increase rapidly, leading to a higher consumption of calories overall. At a certain income level, however, growth in food consumption begins to slow down. The level of income at which this takes place as well as the pace of the slowdown vary by food group. For example, the responsiveness of consumer demand to changes in income remains higher for animal products and some other higher priced items than for staple products. In line with this, in high-income countries, per capita consumption of most food commodities is expected to level off due to saturation. Per capita consumption of sweeteners and fats are projected to decline over the coming decade due to growing health concerns and policy measures that discourage their excessive consumption. In middle-income countries, the evolution towards the dietary patterns of high-income countries away from staples is expected to continue, with the consumption of animal products projected to increase at fast pace. Low-income countries, meanwhile, will continue to obtain most of their calories from staples. Due to income constraints, low growth in the consumption of animal products and other higher-value foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables) is expected in low-income countries. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 2013-22 2023-32 2013-22 2023-32 2013-22 2023-32 2013-22 2023-32 2013-22 2023-32 2013-22 2023-32 Cereals Meat Fish Dairy Sugar Vegetable oil Mt Rest of World NENA China India Sub-Saharan Africa OECD  33 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.10.

Particularly in the least developed countries of the region, the share of food in household expenditures is set to remain high, reflecting a vulnerability of households to income and food price shocks in the most food insecure countries.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/i9tx74 1.2.6. Accounting for loss and waste along the food value chain Another issue of increasing concern to the efficiency of the global food system are food losses along the value chain including food wasted in households and retail establishments. Across the globe, approximately 14% of the world's food, valued at USD 400 billion is lost on an annual basis between harvest and the retail market. At the same time, an estimated further 17% of food is wasted at the retail and consumer levels. Reducing food loss and waste is a significant lever for broader improvements of food systems’ outcomes, including improving food security and sustainability as well as increasing efficiency. Box 1.1 examines the current and projected state of food loss and waste along the value chain at the retail stage and by households. Box 1.1. Food loss and waste: Definitions, global estimates and drivers Literature provides several definitions of food loss and waste (FLW), which complicates the analysis thereof (FAO, 2019[1]). Food waste and losses include plants and animals produced or harvested for human consumption but not ultimately consumed by people (Lipinski et al., 2013[2]); this excludes materials for non-food purposes such as crops for biofuels (FAO, 2011[3]) (FAO, 2019[1]). Since agricultural produce is classified as food when it is ready to be harvested or slaughtered, yield losses resulting from weather events or diseases are excluded (Beausang, Hall and Toma, 2017[4]). Some studies have defined these terms relative to the stage at which the loss or waste occurs in the food value chain (Figure 1.14). Studies by the FAO (2011[3]); (Kummu et al., 2012[5])and (Parfitt, Barthel and Macnaughton, 2010[6])have highlighted that food is lost at the early stages of the value chain, specifically at primary production, post\u0002harvest, and processing, while food is wasted at a later stage, in retail and consumption by end-consumers. Food that was intended for human consumption but is diverted to animal feed is excluded from the 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 North America Europe & Central Asia Developed and East Asia Near East and North Africa Latin America and the Caribbean South and Southeast Asia Sub-Saharan Africa % 2010-12 2020-22 2032  35 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 definition (waste) where the animals remain part of the food value chain (Beausang, Hall and Toma, 2017[4]). Although the definitions provided by the literature differentiate between food loss and waste, there is not one database that measures food loss or waste separately over time. Moreover, the available data does not explicitly distinguish between food loss and food waste. Food loss or waste data is mostly presented as a percentage loss or in quantity (tonnes). Most literature providing FLW estimates contains data from 2005 onwards, with the most publications only post-2015. According to The State of Food and Agriculture report by the (FAO, 2019[1]) only 39 countries have officially reported FLW data on an annual basis between 1990 and 2017. Case studies may cover losses at specific nodes in the value chain, but these differ from case to case. The UNEP Food Index Report (2021[7]) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Report (2022) prepared by the FAO are examples of sources that provide global estimates for FLW. According to the UNEP (2021[7]), global food waste amounts to 931 Mt per annum ‒ generated from households (61%), and the distribution (26%) and food service industries (13%). According to the SDG Progress Report (2022), global food loss remained stable from 2016 to 2020, with substantial variations across regions and subregions. The percentage of food lost in 2020 was 13.3%, compared to 13% in 2016 (FAO, 2022[8]). Figure 1.12 presents losses along the value chain for major crops. Total value chain losses of major crops are estimated at 137.9 Mt in the base period and are estimated to increase up to 157 Mt by 2032. Figure 1.12. Global staples and other field crop losses along the value chain Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/a2f3gi Figure 1.13 illustrates retail waste of major food commodities. Fruits and vegetables contribute more than half of total distribution waste. Rice and wheat as major staples contribute also substantially to total distribution waste (22% during the base period), which is estimated to increase from 180 Mt in the base period to 234 Mt by 2032. Literature broadly accounts for six main factors that generate food loss and waste. These are: economic factors, e.g. globalisation, urbanisation, industrialisation, increasing incomes and consequently dietary transitions; post-harvest losses and value chain inefficiencies in the form of limited access to infrastructure, technology and markets; marketing specifications, including product quality and retailer standards; natural or environmental factors, e.g. climate change and perishability of products; legislation, e.g. agricultural and food safety policies; and technical inefficiencies, poor management, planning and handling. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 2012 2020-22 2032 Mt Maize Roots and tubers Rice Wheat Other coarse grains Pulses Other 36  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.13.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/56qgmd In order to account for food losses and waste, the first step was the compilation of a database trough that combined existing FLW data sources. Figure 1.14 illustrates how the losses quoted in the FAO food balance sheet database (FBS) relate to the definitions of food loss and waste throughout the food value chain as discussed above. The losses set out in the FBS are assumed to cover all food loss up to the retail point of the food value chain. Figure 1.14. Food loss and waste along the food value chain Different approaches were used to estimate the share of food losses and waste at the distribution level. For each food group, we derived an equation relating food loss share to relevant macroeconomic variables (selected to represent drivers of food loss identified in literature) to estimate a share of food loss for each country. The FAO Food Security database includes a percentage of total calories lost of all food items per country. This was used to estimate the consumption waste share for each commodity using the study by Oelosfe et al. (2021[9]) to “translate” the total calorie loss share per food item to a food waste volume share per food group. 0 50 100 150 200 250 2010-12 2020-22 2032 Mt Fruits and Vegetables Staples Animal Products Other  37 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 1.2.7. Developments in sugar consumption World sugar consumption is expected to continue to rise primarily in regions with significant population growth, notably Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Near East and North Africa region (Figure 1.15). In high\u0002income countries a decline in per capita consumption is projected, reflecting rising health concerns among consumers and measures implemented by countries to discourage sugar consumption. The pace of growth in consumption is expected to slow down in nearly all regions compared to the previous decade. Figure 1.15. Evolution in per capita food consumption of sugar, by world region, 2020-22 to 2032 Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/dlc59f 1.2.8. Developments in protein consumption In response to changing dietary preferences among increasingly affluent and health-conscious consumers in high-income and emerging countries, total per capita availability of protein sources is expected to rise at the global level to 88.4g per day in 2032, from 83.9g per day in the base period. However, regional differences in the composition of protein sources will persist, with Sub-Saharan Africa and the Near East and North Africa region expected to remain heavily dependent on proteins from crop sources, given their substantially lower average household incomes (Figure 1.16). Protein from animal sources will continue to account for the bulk of protein consumption in the high-income regions of North America, Europe, and Central Asia. About two-thirds of meat is expected to be consumed by one-third of the world’s population in 2032, which is only a slight improvement from the base period. The high per capita use in high-income countries is the main reason for this. In some countries such as China, despite per capita consumption being comparatively low, total meat consumption will be substantial given their large population sizes (Figure 1.17). Over the outlook period, animal proteins are expected to make further advances in their contribution to total daily per capita availability due to rising per capita incomes globally. Growth in animal protein consumption will be particularly pronounced in Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean region, where daily per capita meat and fish availability is expected to rise by 11-13% and 6-4%, respectively. Income\u0002driven growth in consumption of meat and fish in China, which is respectively expected to see an 12% and 14% total increase in daily per capita availability by 2032, will be the main contributor. However, regarding the projected increase in meat consumption in China, it is important to note that this will be from a lower base following the recent shock caused by the outbreak of African Swine Fever. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Sub-Saharan Africa Near East and North Africa Europe & Central Asia North America Latin America and the Caribbean India China OECD World kg/person 2020-22 2032 38  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.16.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/z1ixp5 Overall, growth in global average consumption of meat is expected to increase by 2.5% over the outlook period, amounting to an increase of 0.7 kg/per capita/year in boneless retail weight equivalent, to reach 29.5 kg/year by 2032. Consumption growth in middle-income countries, as outlined above, will account for a significant share of this increase. However, against high and rising consumer expenses and weaker income growth, the Outlook expects growth in global meat demand to be slower than over the last decade.

In terms of substitution between meat and aquatic foods, mounting environmental and health concerns are expected to continue to shift consumer preferences away from red and processed meat, notably beef, towards leaner and allegedly more environmentally friendly alternatives, notably poultry and fish. These shifts will be particularly pronounced in Europe and North America. Demand for poultry in Sub-Saharan Africa will be primarily driven by the higher affordability of poultry compared to beef. 1.2.9. Global outlook for feed use of agricultural commodities Demand for feed is driven by two factors: the number of farm animals and the feed use per animal. Over the projection period, the expanding animal herds and the continuing intensification of the livestock sector will drive an increase in feed demand in most world regions (Figure 1.18). Low- and middle-income countries are expected to account for the bulk of the increase as moderate to strong growth in feed consumption is projected over the coming decade, in line with or exceeding the growth in animal production, as these countries move to more commercialised and feed-intensive production systems. Particularly in Southeast Asia, increasing animal production is projected to raise demand for mostly imported protein meal. By contrast, demand growth in China is expected to slow down considerably, driven by improved feed efficiency combined with efforts to achieve lower protein meal shares in livestock feed rations. In high-income countries, higher production efficiency resulting in herd reductions, especially in dairy production, means feed consumption of both protein meal and cereals is expected to grow slowly as improvements in animal genetics, feed technology and herd management will continue to generate substantial efficiency gains in livestock and dairy production. Notably in the European Union, the second\u0002largest user of protein meal, consumption is expected to decline as growth in animal production slows and other protein sources are increasingly used in feed (Figure 1.19). Figure 1.18. Feed demand by component and by region, 2013-22 and 2023-32 Note: Low protein feed includes maize, wheat, other coarse grains, rice, cereal brans, beet pulp, molasses, roots and tubers. Medium protein feed includes dried distilled grains, pulses, whey powder. High protein feed includes protein meal, fish meal, and skim milk powder.

Global outlook for industrial use of agricultural commodities Biofuels have become the dominant industrial use of agricultural commodities in recent years. Their production uses cereals and sugar crops, but also processed products such as molasses and various vegetable oils. Demand for biofuels is largely determined by transport fuel demand and domestic support policies. Over the next decade, global biofuel use is projected to continue to expand substantially, driven mainly by additional demand for biofuels in middle-income countries, where higher blending rates are being implemented, supported by subsidies for domestic production and blended fuel use (Figure 1.20). A substantial increase in biodiesel production in the United States due to increasing targets and the increased application of state and federal renewable fuel programmes and biomass-based diesel tax credits (under the IRA of 2022) will further generate additional demand. By contrast, in other high-income countries, notably in the European Union, demand growth will be constrained by declining transport fuel demand and reduced policy incentives. In the European Union, the RED II (Renewable Energy Directive) has classified palm oil-based biodiesel in the high ILUC (Indirect Land Use Change) risk category. As a result, the use of palm oil-based biodiesel is expected to decrease, thereby slightly reducing total biodiesel use in the European Union. Nevertheless, the share of biodiesel in total diesel use is expected to grow over the coming decade. Transport fuel consumption is expected to expand in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Paraguay over the coming years, with ethanol and biodiesel usage projected to increase accordingly. Indonesia's diesel use is set to rise and the blending rate is assumed to stay above 30% (B30). In South and Southeast Asia, biodiesel is expected to become more popular due to the growth in transport fuel demand and for industrial use. In India, sugarcane-based ethanol is projected to contribute significantly towards the goal of achieving an ethanol blend rate of 16% by 2025, whereas the E20 target should be met by 2032. Agricultural commodities are also used as feedstock for other industrial applications, including in the material (plastic, clothing, paint), bio-chemical, and bio-pharmaceutical industries. “Other” uses, mostly industrial applications of agricultural commodities for commercial production such as grains for industrial starch production, have become increasingly important in recent years and are expected to gain importance in absolute terms. 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00 High-income countries Upper middle-income countries Lower middle-income countries Low-income countries % p.a.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/txrfb8 1.2.11. Uncertainties affecting global demand for agricultural commodities The medium-term projections presented in the Outlook assume a fast recovery from inflationary pressures, no change to policies in place, and an on-trend evolution in consumer preferences over the coming decade. These assumptions introduce some uncertainty into the projections of agricultural commodity demand. Aside from conflict and geopolitical tensions, at present the most severe threat to the consumption of agricultural commodities – and the consumption of food in particular – is posed by the adverse economic repercussions of persistently high inflation rates and a potential global recession. At the time of writing, global reference prices in real terms were expected to decline slightly over the coming decade; however, consumer prices may spike in response to severe economic, political or environmental events, as further 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 2010-12 to 2020-22 2020-22 to 2032 2010-12 to 2020-22 2020-22 to 2032 Ethanol Biodiesel Bln L Brazil United States European Union China India Indonesia Other 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 Wheat Rice Other coarse grains Maize Sugarcane Vegetable oil Molasses % % of biofuel in total use % of other industrial uses in total use 42  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 described in the prices section. Uncertainty further arises from the fact that many additional factors along the food value chain may contribute to food price inflation, including market power in the processing and retailing sectors. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated its global economic implication and potentially threatens the proper functioning of local and global food systems. Coupled with other uncertainties such as climate change, the negative ramifications of all these factors for global economic growth may result in a global recession, suggesting that the income growth projections underlying the Outlook may not materialise. In this regard, the reduced prospects would likely result in a downward adjustment in global food demand, with different adjustment for different commodities. Furthermore, the last revision of the UN’s population projection resulted in a downward revision of population growth in some countries (e.g. China), and while not significant, does point to the possibility of lower-than-expected population growth in the future, with direct implications for lower growth in global demand for food. Income and food price shocks, especially in countries where the share of food in expenditures is high, pose an additional threat, as does the risk of further disease outbreaks that may disrupt human health or the production of agricultural commodities. Mounting environmental and health concerns, as well as animal welfare concerns, are expected to increasingly influence consumer choices and to drive growing demand for higher value items, such as poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, as well as for alternative food stuffs, such as dairy alternatives, gluten free foods, and vegan meat substitutes. These ongoing developments could have a significant impact on agricultural commodity demand in the future, especially regarding the consumption of products with large environmental footprints or purportedly adverse health effects, such as palm oil, cotton, beef, and sugar. In contrast, demand for certified food as well as vegetarian and vegan alternatives, often touted as more nutritious and environmentally friendly, may increase. However, the potential trade\u0002offs between healthier and more sustainable diets based on Life Cycle Analysis need to be considered. For example, while an increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables may be desirable from a health point of view, the typically intensive use of agro-chemicals and water in their cultivation as well as the high emissions from cold chains and transport may not be desirable from an environmental perspective. On the other hand, a reduction in meat and dairy consumption in populations where it is very high may provide net benefits. 1.3. Production Projections for the production of crops, livestock and fish products covered by the Outlook are presented. This section also examines the underlying drivers of production, namely crop yields, cropping intensity, and agricultural land use in the crop sector, and the number of farm animals and output per animal in the livestock sector. Over the coming decade, the global production (measured in constant prices) of crops, livestock and fish commodities covered by the Outlook is expected to increase by 1.1% p.a., a slower rate than in previous decades. The reduced growth incentives are driven by a weakening of expected gross returns for producers from both sales and due to costs developments. The proceeds of production sales are not expected to follow a sustained growth because of projected flat or slightly declining trends of world prices in real terms and slower population growth. Input costs are expected to increase, notably because of the nexus between energy and fertiliser prices and tightening of environmental regulations. Middle- and low-income countries, including China, India and other Asian countries, will continue to drive growth (Figure 1.22). By 2032, the whole Asian region is expected to account for more than half of global crop production, almost half of livestock production, and almost three-quarters of fish production. Production growth will be driven almost entirely by productivity in this resource-constrained region. Production in Sub-Saharan Africa and Near East and North Africa is expected to grow significantly, although from a low base. In these regions, the bulk of agricultural output comes from crops production,  43 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 but higher value livestock production is expected to grow faster over the coming decade in response to a rapid population increase and urbanisation. In Sub-Saharan Africa, growth in crop production will be underpinned by a combination of area expansion, changing crop mix, and productivity gains; dairy will drive much of the growth of livestock production. In Near East and North Africa, growth in crop production will be derived mainly from productivity gains as the region is faced with severe constraints in the availability of arable land and water. Poultry will drive most of the increase in livestock production. Europe and Central Asia is expected to be the region with the slowest production growth, mostly driven by Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Growth will mainly be derived from productivity gains as the long-term decline in agricultural land-use is expected to persist, but tighter regulations related to environmental sustainability and animal welfare will place downward pressure on yield improvements. Production growth in North America is expected to be limited. Crop production is expected to grow faster than livestock production, reversing the trend of the past decade. Production growth will be driven by productivity gains. In Latin America and the Caribbean, production growth is projected to slow down compared to the last decade. Growth is expected to come predominantly from crop production. The region’s land abundance contributes to strong crop production growth, which is derived from a combination of expansion and intensification, but yield gains are expected to play a bigger role because of an expected rapid increase in fertiliser application. Despite slower growth in livestock production, the region will continue to be a large contributor to global production. Figure 1.22.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/mjs9hd 1.3.1. Productivity improvements drive crop production growth Overall, crop production is projected to expand slightly faster (1.2% p.a.) than livestock or fish production (each at 1.1% p.a.). This result is driven by productivity, mostly from yield developments and to a lesser extent crop intensification rather than from land use, but with important regional and sectoral variations (Figure 1.23). 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 India China Asia Pacific (excl.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/rowqum In Sub-Saharan Africa, yield growth is expected to almost double to 16% over the next decade compared to 8% over the previous one. Investments in locally adapted and improved crop varieties, increased access to fertilisers, and consolidation of land holdings that has allowed for more large-scale and mechanised farming will spur growth in crop production. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the largest untapped agricultural land and the expansion of the area harvested has been an important driver of production growth over the last decade. However, the role of land expansion in production growth is projected to decrease because it is increasingly difficult to convert land for agriculture in what remains largely unreachable areas, conflict zones, or conservation areas. Growth in the Near East and North Africa region is entirely based on yield growth because of the decline in the harvested area. In Western Europe, yield growth is projected to slow down due to stricter environmental regulations, whereas in North America it will be underpinned by investment in innovations and wider biotechnological options. Crop yield variations Over the coming decade, yield growth is projected to contribute 79% on average to global production growth of the main crops covered by the Outlook. Projected rates differ across regions and countries due to differences in production technologies, management practices, natural resource endowment, and local climatic conditions (Figure 1.24). Farmers in low- and middle-income countries, notably Brazil and India, are projected to achieve growth rates above the world average for maize, wheat and rice through better adapted seeds and improved crop management. Notable yield increases in Sub-Saharan Africa are also projected, but average cereal yields in 2032 are expected to remain at less than a third of high-income countries. In high-income countries, the growth in yields is projected to be smaller than the world average for the main crops, except for pulses. Yields in these countries are already close to the production frontier and further increases are constrained by stricter environmental regulations.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/zg8e5a 1.3.2. The role of fertiliser prices in driving food prices Fertilisers provide essential nutrients for maintaining agricultural crop yields and quality, and for growth in production. The three most important nutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Nitrogen is the most fundamental nutrient for crop yields because it ensures that plants remain healthy as they develop and are nutritious once they are harvested. Phosphorus supports a plant’s ability to use and store energy, and helps with normal development. Potassium strengthens a plant’s resistance to disease and its overall quality. The application of N-based fertilisers is critical for crop yields in the short run and the effectiveness depends on the timing of its application. Application of N-based fertilisers cannot be delayed in response to price changes, in contrast to the application of P and K fertilisers which can be in order to optimise variations in overall input costs since P and K nutrients remain in the soil for a longer period of time. The production of N-based mineral fertilisers is dependent on the availability of natural gas both as a raw material and to power the synthesis process. Given this link, the production of nitrogen fertilisers is concentrated in countries that have access to natural gas: China, India, the United States, and Russia (Figure 1.25). Over the period 2016-2020, Russia was the main exporter of N-based fertilisers, responsible for 15% of global exports, followed by China (13%). Key importers of nitrogen fertilisers over the same period were India and Brazil, both accounting for 11% of global imports. -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Maize Wheat Other coarse grains Rice Other oilseeds Soybean Pulses t/ha United-States China Brazil India European-Union Sub-Saharan Africa Russia Australia World average 46  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.25.

High-income countries are rolling out various incentives to curb the use of synthetic fertilisers, notably by increasing their efficiency through better management practices or expanding the use of nutrient alternatives such as biofertilisers. In Australia, the relatively limited increase in yields can be explained by physical and climatic constraints. In Brazil, the use of N-fertilisers is expected to grow significantly due to the increase in production, and yield increase should outpace N-fertiliser application over the projected period. While several factors such as progress in breeding can play a role in future yield developments, improvements in crop management, use of nitrogen-fixing crops or biofertilisers will play a critical role in the increase of maize production yields. Sub-Saharan Africa is also expected to experience significant increases in both N-fertiliser application and yields, but from a low base. A scenario analysis was undertaken to examine the impact of a 25% increase of N-, P- and K-fertiliser prices on fertiliser application, resulting crop production and commodity prices, while keeping oil price constant. Factors underpinning such fertiliser price increases other than an oil shock would include, for example, market access restrictions, tighter environment regulations, or increases in other manufacturing costs such as labour or minerals. Figure 1.27 shows the percentage change of selected commodity prices from the baseline projections in 2032 to those of the scenario projections in 2032. On average, agricultural commodity prices would increase by 5%. The impact would be greater on crops that use fertilisers as direct inputs than on livestock products that use them indirectly through feed. Among livestock products, the increase in prices is greater for poultry and pigmeat than it is for ruminants because the former relies more on compound feed. Figure 1.27.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/cqrl79 This scenario illustrates how changes in fertiliser prices readily translate into changes of product prices and hence food prices. Consumers who spend a high share of their household budget on food and fuel would be particularly impacted.

Growth in livestock and fish production varies in intensity across region Global production of livestock and fish is projected to expand by 10% over the next decade, almost half the rate of the previous decade. A significant share of this growth will be driven by production in China (13%), India (34%), and other middle- and low-income countries (Figure 1.28). In China, the expansion will be largely underpinned by the recovery from African Swine Fever (ASF) and in India by sustained growth in diary production. In Sub-Saharan Africa and Near East and North Africa, livestock and fish production is expected to increase by more than 20%, mostly because of the expansion of the dairy and poultry meat sectors. The rising demand for high value food spurred by the ongoing urbanisation of these regions is expected to be mainly met by local production rather than by imports. Insufficient infrastructures and associated elevated transport and logistic costs will remain major impediments to trade in these regions. In high-income countries, overall growth will be limited. In Europe, factors such as the current African Swine Fever outbreaks, stricter environmental laws, and animal welfare regulations in some EU countries will exert pressure on production growth. In North America, the intensive production system is expected to recover slowly from recent high feed prices and labour costs. Almost all production of animal proteins will experience single-digit growth over the coming decade, except for the dairy sector in North America which will grow by 20% by 2032. Improvements in dairy cow milk yields will be the main contributor to milk production in the region. Figure 1.28.

The greatest increase in production will occur in Asia Pacific, notably in India, largely as a result of increased feed intensity and breeding improvements. Poultry meat will significantly expand in Sub-Saharan Africa and Near East and North Africa, albeit from a low base. In North America and Europe and Central Asia, poultry meat will be driven by its greater attractivity for consumers compared to bovine meat and its improved profitability in the medium term due to shorter production cycles.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/5h9u7a Pigmeat production is expected to recover in Asian ASF-affected countries, growing by 19% in China, the largest producing country, and 23% in other Asian countries over the coming decade. In Europe, pigmeat production will decline over the next decade mainly because of stricter environmental regulations and animal welfare standards. Beef production is expected to expand by 9% and contribute to 16% of the total increase in global meat production. Overall, beef production will increase with higher carcass weights as feed costs decline and animal genetics improve, although in the fastest growing African regions the increase will be driven by higher herd numbers. In Europe and North America, beef production will adjust to stricter environmental sustainability standards for the former and severe pressure on the profitability of the intensive model of production for the latter. Sheepmeat production will contribute only 6% to the overall growth in meat production and is expected to expand by 15% over the coming decade. Increased availability in the global sheepmeat market will be due to flock rebuilding and increased lambing rates in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Production in the European Union is projected to increase slightly due to income support and favourable producer prices. Sheep and goat meat production in Sub-Saharan Africa will grow by almost 30% despite pressure on pasture land due to desertification.

Population growth in the main consuming middle- and low-income regions, as well as per capita consumption growth for fresh and processed dairy products will incentivise investments in dairy production. India and Pakistan are projected to rank first and second, respectively, in terms of absolute growth of milk production and to generate over half of the increase in global milk production; they will jointly account for 30% of production by 2032. In these countries, the increase in milk production will be due primarily to herd expansion (Figure 1.30). In Sub-Saharan Africa, the 33% growth in milk production is projected to originate from an increase in the number of milk-producing animals. The region will also experience some yield improvement, albeit from the lower levels produced by ovine animals that are mainly used to provide milk. Production in the European Union, the second largest global milk producer after India, is expected to decline slightly in response to the ongoing transition towards environmentally sustainable production, the expansion of organic production, and the shift from intensive to pasture-based production systems.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0bcfp1 Fish production Global fish production is projected to grow by 12% over the coming decade, albeit at a slower rate compared to the previous decade. This slowdown in growth reflects the impact of policy changes in China toward more sustainable fisheries, the higher costs for fuel inputs, and the assumption that 2024, 2028 and 2032 will be El Nino years that will result in lower production, mainly in Latin America and the Caribbean (Figure 1.31). Most of the increase in fish production is expected to come from Asia, which will account for more than 70% of global production by 2032. The largest contributors to output growth are expected to be China, India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam. Production will be driven by continuing but slower progression in aquaculture production and broadly stable capture fisheries production, except during the years of El Nino. By 2032, aquaculture production is projected to account for more than half of total fish production.

Investments and human capital are vital for productivity gains Investments in agricultural infrastructure, research and development, wider access to more productive agricultural inputs, improved farm management practices, including the adoption of digital automation technologies are important factors that enhance productivity. The availability of human capital employed in the agricultural sector is a key determinant of production growth. Nevertheless, there remain important barriers for human capital to thrive within the current food systems. For instance, the lack of access to finance for youth or smallholders, or the insufficient attention to the constraints faced by women in food systems (Box 1.2) are impediments to productivity gains. A recent FAO report on the status of women in agrifood systems (FAO, 2023[10]) shows that inequalities related to land tenure, credit, training, and technology create a 24% gender gap in productivity between women and men farmers on farms of equal size. In September 2021, the United Nations Food Systems Summit urged for the greater integration of women in food systems, notably calling for solutions that narrow the gender gap and support women entrepreneurship. Subsequently, in adopting the Ministerial Declaration on Transformative Solutions for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems in November 2022, Ministers of Agriculture of OECD countries and partner economies worldwide committed to promoting and measuring progress towards inclusive food systems and to reinforce measures that foster greater opportunity for women in the agricultural sector. -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Developed and East Asia region South and Southeast Asia Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Sub-Saharan Africa North America Near East and North Africa Mt Average 2020-22 Growth by 2032 52  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Box 1.2. Gender and food systems Understanding the role of women in food systems The livelihoods of men and women in food-related activities differ. The contribution of women to food systems remains overlooked, irrespective of their role as entrepreneurs, workers, or consumers. A recent OECD report (Giner, Hobeika and Fischetti, 2022[11]) explores the extent of women’s participation to food systems and identifies the following key insights. • Women as entrepreneurs: Women are less likely than men to lead businesses in the agri-food industry. • Women as workers: Women represent one-third of the workforce in agriculture, but earn disproportionately less than men and are more involved in lower-skilled or informal jobs. • Women as consumers: Given their overrepresentation among low-income and single parent households, women tend to spend a larger share of their disposable income on food and are more at risk of food insecurity. Barriers to enhanced women’s entrepreneurship in agri-food systems are threefold. • Inequality of endowments with unequal access to land and assets, education, entrepreneurial and digital skills, and professional networks, • Formal and informal external barriers including longstanding sociocultural and institutional gender norms and land inheritance systems, • Internal barriers, such as internalised discriminatory practices, that lead to reduced self\u0002confidence and undervaluation of competencies of women with consequences on the tasks undertaken by female farm owners and managers. Fostering gender inclusion can have positive impacts on the triple challenge faced by food systems, which is to ensure food security and nutrition for a growing population, support the livelihoods of millions of people working in the food supply chain, and to do so in an environmentally sustainable way. Greater gender diversity at the decision-making level can translate into firms taking more environmentally conscious decisions. Evidence gaps on women in food systems A move towards greater gender equality requires applying a gender lens when developing and implementing policies related to food systems, as well as collecting better evidence on gender and food systems. The contributions of women as entrepreneurs, workers, and consumers across food systems are difficult to recognise because of the lack of sex-disaggregated data. This prevents policy makers from considering the interests and concerns of both women and men at all stages of policy processes. Digital technologies and government-wide commitments can facilitate the information collection process. Regular reporting on the situation of women across food systems can raise awareness on their roles, on the barriers they face, and on progress achieved. Gender in food systems policies The main strategy to reach gender equality is to apply gender mainstreaming to agricultural and food policies. This is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, regulations, policies, or programmes, in all areas and at all levels.  53 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Furthermore, countries use a combination of instruments to support women as workers and entrepreneurs in food systems, with the aim of supporting: the rights and needs of women on family farms, and access to land, equipment, finance and markets. However, not much is known about the effectiveness and impact of these policy instruments; robust ex ante and ex post gender impact assessments could evaluate the cost-effectiveness of measures introduced and revaluate resource allocations. A roadmap for addressing evidence gaps Many countries are committed to achieving gender equality. Giner, Hobeika and Fischetti (2022[11]) provide a five-step roadmap to identify and overcome evidence gaps on gender aspects and policies that address gender inequality in food systems. • Apply a gender lens when developing policies related to food systems. • Identify and close evidence gaps on gender and food systems by collecting sex-disaggregated data. • Develop and implement a mix of policy instruments that address gender inequality and support women in food systems. • Monitor and evaluate policy impacts and their effectiveness. • Adjust policy responses. Notes: Gender is defined as Socially constructed and socially learned behaviours and expectations associated with females and males. All cultures interpret and elaborate the biological differences between women and men into a set of social expectations about what behaviours and activities are appropriate and what rights, resources, and power women and men possess. Like race, ethnicity, and class, gender is a social category that largely establishes one’s life chances and participation in society and in the economy (OECD, 2018[12]). 1.3.5. Environmental impacts of agricultural production Direct GHG emissions The Outlook estimates direct GHG emissions using the FAOSTAT Emissions-Agriculture database and following the IPCC’s Tier 1 approach (i.e. basic method relying on direct emission factors such as herd size). The projections assume no change in current policies and on-trend technological progress. Higher\u0002tier methods (that account for management practices or land use change for instance) would provide greater certainty of the estimates but are not undertaken given the scope of the Outlook. Subject to the above caveat, global direct agricultural emissions are set to increase by 7.5% over the coming decade, while the projected increase in agricultural production is 13% (Figure 1.32). Livestock production will account for 80% of this increase. Geographically, most of the increase in emissions is projected to occur in middle and low-income regions due to the higher growth in ruminant production in systems that are emission intensive. Synthetic fertilisers are an important source of direct GHG emissions. High energy prices, domestic policies, and developments in market access will shift the use of fertilisers at the global level (Section 1.3.2). Country-level efficiencies in applying fertilisers to agricultural soils by, for example, applying a new generation “special fertiliser products”, such as stabilised nitrogen fertilisers, slow and controlled-release fertilisers, and water-soluble fertilisers, can increase nutrient use efficiency and reduce the need for application; thus lowering GHG emissions. In some countries, governments strongly encourage the use of special fertiliser products or organic fertilisers. In others, farmers have adopted these products without government intervention because of the economic and environmental benefits. 54  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Rice cultivation is another major source of GHG emissions because irrigated paddy fields emit a lot of methane. The projected increase in rice production, however, will be largely the result of yield improvements with unchanged paddy areas, thereby largely limiting any increase in GHG emissions. Figure 1.32.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/zk1iuh At the global level, growth in direct GHG emissions from agriculture will be lower than in the previous decade and lower than the projected growth in agricultural output, indicating a faster decline in the carbon intensity of agricultural production (Figure 1.33). This will be the case in Europe, Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean due to yield improvements and a declining share of ruminant production. In other regions, the growth of GHG emissions is projected to be greater than in the previous decade. In low- and middle-income countries in Asia Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa, increased GHG emissions are due to the projected higher output growth in these regions. While important efforts are undertaken in these regions to make production systems more sustainable, on average those tend to be more emission\u0002intensive than in high-income countries. By 2032, Sub-Saharan Africa will experience the highest growth in direct GHG emission per year (1.7%), accounting for 16% of global direct GHG emissions from agriculture but only 7% of crop and livestock production. In Europe and Central Asia, annual direct GHG emissions from agriculture are projected to be divided by three, while agricultural output is expected to increase by 7%. Further reductions in the carbon intensity of agricultural production could be achieved by the large-scale adoption of emission-reducing technologies and agricultural practices. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Total Ruminants Other livestock Synthetic fertiliser Rice cultivation Other Gt Co2-eq % 2020-22 2032 Total growth 2020-22 to 2032 (right axis)  55 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.33.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/rk2xtz Land use Agriculture uses 38% of the global land area, with one-third of this area dedicated to the cultivation of crops and the rest to livestock grazing. Land conversion from natural ecosystems to agriculture has been historically the largest cause of GHG emissions. The expansion of cropland is projected to account for 15% of crop production growth. Over the coming decade, total agricultural land use is not expected to increase as overall cropland increases will be offset by overall pasture decreases. There will be regional variations in the locations where there are increases in cropland and decreases in pastureland. Figure 1.34 shows the changes in total crop land over the coming decade. Projected trends in land use will vary across regions and commodities, with the largest reduction in pastureland use and the largest increase in cropland use occurring in the Asia and Pacific region. In this region, pasture is expected to be converted into cropland, whereas in Latin America mainly non-agricultural land will be brought into use. In the Near East and North Africa, the expansion of cropland will be constrained by natural conditions. Low rainfall is a barrier to rain fed agriculture and the cost of irrigation is prohibitive in most places. In North America and Western Europe, cropland is projected to decrease, since any increase in crop production is tightly regulated by policies on environmental sustainability, and as land used for fruits, vegetables and other crops is expected to decline. Pastureland is expected to decrease in Asia and Pacific, excluding China and India, due to the expected transition from pasture-based beef, sheep and goat production to more intensive production systems for pigs and poultry. Ruminant production is assumed to shift to more feed-intensive production systems which require less pastureland. Pastureland is projected to increase slightly in North America due to the expansion of the cattle herd. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 Asia Pacific Sub-Saharan Africa Near East and North Africa Europe and Central Asia North America Latin America and the Caribbean World % p.a.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/f7igxa 1.3.6. Uncertainties affecting agricultural production Russia’s war against Ukraine, and policy responses introduced in many countries, have triggered further rise in energy and fertiliser prices, and increased the price volatility of those inputs. Despite recent easing, the risk of continued uncertainties could alter production decisions, limit input use and subsequently depress yield growth, eventually threatening global food security. The production of agricultural commodities remains vulnerable to plant and animal diseases. The recent ASF outbreak led to significant losses in pigmeat production in East Asia and a desert locust infestation caused significant production losses in East Africa in 2020. The Outlook does not assume a recurrence of these or similar events, but the success of measures to combat diseases and pests remains a concern. Historically, private sector investment has been the principal driver of productivity growth and productivity enhancement was expected to come from tangible inputs. Private companies usually invested more into technological innovations and research and development related to the development of new plant varieties, equipment, machinery and chemicals inputs for which they could expect return on investment from intellectual property rights and direct sales to farmers. It is currently unknown how the strengthening of environmental policies to foster sustainability of the agricultural sector might reshape global patterns of production. Future policies will likely impose stricter standards on the use of chemicals in production and promote new production practices, including the use of organic alternatives. However, this risks placing downward pressure on yields, which could lead to higher food prices if other innovations are not developed or adopted fast enough. There is at present a gap in research and programmes that aim to transmit better management practices to farmers given that such activities neither bring in royalties nor have public institutions endorsed them (OECD, 2022[13]). As climate change is expected to increase, the magnitude and frequencies of extreme weather events, sanitary and phytosanitary conditions will change, and the natural endowment of agriculture and food producing regions could be irreversibly changed (IPCC, 2022[14]); this could encourage producers to adjust their production methods. -1.2 -0.8 -0.4 0 0.4 0.8 1.2 -22 -18 -14 -10 -6 -2 2 6 10 14 18 22 India China Asia Pacific excl China and India Sub-Saharan Africa Near East and North Africa Europe and Central Asia North America Latin America and the Caribbean Mha Pasture Cropland Total change (Mha) Total growth 2020-22 to 2032 %  57 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 1.4. Trade International agricultural trade links the food systems of countries. By efficiently moving agricultural products globally from surplus to deficit regions, trade continues to play a critical role in providing consumers worldwide with sufficient, safe, and nutritious food, while generating income for farmers, workers and traders in agriculture and food industry. The COVID-19 pandemic led to trade disruptions worldwide, but trade in the agricultural commodities covered by the Outlook proved to be more resilient than other sectors of the economy. In the short run, the Outlook assumes the continuation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is crucial for global food security as grain and fertiliser prices remain high. The importance of trade in ensuring food security will likely increase in the future in view of changing demand and supply forces. First, the ongoing major demographic changes combined with developments in income, dietary preferences, and urbanisation are expected to have an increasing impact on global consumption patterns. In this respect, trade can help improve availability and access to food and agriculture products. Second, as the significant adverse effects of climate change on agriculture and food supply are expected to worsen, trade can also contribute to the stability of food security. Well-functioning domestic and international markets are essential to supporting the transformation towards the greater sustainability and resilience that is needed to address the triple challenge facing agriculture and food systems. 1.4.1. Agricultural and fish trade continues to grow but at a slower pace Over the coming decade, trade in agricultural commodities covered in the Outlook is projected to expand by 1% p.a., which about a third of the rate of the last ten years. This slowdown is due to the expected weakening of the main historical drivers of global demand for traded commodities, namely the slower growth in demand for agricultural products by China and other middle-income countries. Agricultural commodities products were traded more intensively in the early 2000s, reflecting the implementation of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture and China’s accession to the rules-based trading system in December 2001. Growth in both agricultural and industrial trade entered a downward trend in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. The Outlook assumes a diminishing impact of previous trade liberalisation efforts that boosted agricultural trade, as progress to reduce multilateral tariffs and reforms to trade-distorting producer support have largely stalled in recent years. Figure 1.35 shows the average annual growth in trade volumes for selected commodities covered in the Outlook. Given their share in overall volumes traded, maize, soybeans and wheat contributed the most to overall agrifood trade growth of the last decade. These commodities are projected to experience the biggest drop in trade growth over the coming decade. Because of their importance in feed use, the drop in the global export of maize can be explained by the projected increase in maize production in China that will reduce its need for imported feed over the medium term. Trade growth in poultry and beef are expected to drop sharply due to the slowdown of the convergence in diets and the reduction in Chinese imports from Europe and Latin America and Caribbean regions. The exceptionally high growth of trade in pigmeat over the previous decade was due to the African Swine Fever outbreak in China, which forced the country to import massively in 2019 and 2020. 58  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.35.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/g28zwv The increase in the growth of cotton traded will reflect the growing demand for raw cotton by the textile industry, which is mostly located in countries with limited production potential (e.g. Bangladesh, Viet Nam). High import demand for raw cotton will be largely met by growing exports from the top exporters (the United States, Brazil, and Sub-Saharan Africa). International trade in sugar will continue to grow, mainly reflecting expanding demand from deficit regions in low- and middle-income economies. Trade in rice is projected to increase, supported by India’s production surplus mainly directed to Sub-Saharan Africa. 1.4.2. The share of production traded is stabilising, with sustained dominance of top exporting countries The share of production traded for the commodities covered in the Outlook has been gradually increasing over time, rising from an average of 15% in 2000, to 23% in the baseline period 2020-22, and reflects a trade sector that has been growing at a faster pace than agricultural production. Assuming a diminishing impact of previous trade liberalisation efforts that boosted global agricultural trade and no major changes in policies, trade relative to production is projected to stabilise over the next decade, with growth in trade and production being more closely aligned. However, there are significant variations in the importance of trade across commodities (Figure 1.36). For many agricultural commodities, most of the production is used domestically. For a few commodities trade represents at least one-third of global production. This is the case for sugar, cotton, vegetable oils, soybean, and milk powders, which are either demanded for further processing or produced in highly concentrated markets. Over the coming decade, the share of production that is traded will not change significantly for most commodities covered in the Outlook and few will experience some shifts in trading patterns. The export ratio of cotton and fish is projected to decline marginally, reflecting either weakness in import demand or increasing domestic use, or in the case of biodiesel, both tendencies.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/5gz8nf For commodities covered in the Outlook, the five largest exporting countries generally account for 70% or more of global export volume, a trend that is expected to continue over the coming decade. Figure 1.34 shows the export share of the top five exporters for each commodity. For soybeans, this share exceeded 96% in 2020-22. Even for commodities with relatively less concentrated exports, such as fish and beef, the five leading exporters accounted for 42% and 58% of global exports in 2020-22, respectively. For almost all commodities (except pigmeat, ethanol, and whole milk powder), exports from the top five exporters are expected to increase over the coming decade. The biggest increase in export dominance of the top five exporting countries is projected for trade in biodiesel. The top five exporters of biodiesel are expected to increase their share from 65% to 79% over the next ten years, supported by growing exports of biodiesel from recycled cooking oil from Singapore and of soybean-oil based biodiesel from the United\u0002States. The biodiesel export share of China, however, is projected to drop over the next ten years due to limited growth in its production of biodiesel from recycled cooking oil. The dominance of the top five exporting countries of cereal is projected to increase over the next ten years. The share of the top five exporting countries of rice is projected to rise from 80% in 2020-22 to 85% in 2032, mainly due to strong export growth in India and Thailand. The export share of the five leading exporters is projected to increase from 75% in 2020-22 to 78% in 2032 for other coarse grains. This share is expected to slightly increase by 2 percentage points over the same period reaching 74% in 2032 for wheat, while it will remain unchanged for maize. Dairy exports are expected to become more dominated by the top five exporting countries, with growing dominance from key suppliers in high-income countries. For cheese, for instance, the export share of the top five exporters is projected to increase from 75% to 80%, mainly driven by strong export growth in the leading exporter, the European Union.

The latter is projected to account for 35% of global SMP exports in 2032, up from 30% in 2020-22. This high dominance of leading exporting countries risks having significant impacts on global markets if exports are interrupted due to adverse production shocks (e.g. poor harvests), policy changes in the major exporting countries, or conflict. Such interruptions could affect prices and availability of agricultural commodities, with implications for global food security. Risks to global markets are particularly high for highly traded commodities. 1.4.3. Growing differentiation between net exporting and net importing regions Over the coming decade, the net exporting position of the Americas and Eastern Europe Central Asia and net importing position of Asia, the Middle East and Africa are expected to deepen. The evolution of agri\u0002food surpluses and deficits of the main regions of the world (Figure 1.37, panel a) and important trading countries (Figure 1.37, panel b) sheds light on the direction of trade that differentiates net exporters from net importers. Increasing trade surpluses from traditional exporters The Latin America and Caribbean region has experienced a vast expansion of its exports, notably from Brazil, and is projected to reinforce its position as the world’s prime exporter of basic agricultural commodities. The dramatic surge in South America owes much to the spread of farming into the drylands of the cerrado in Brazil, which was not cultivated until the 1990s. The continued growth in production of soybeans, maize, protein meals, meat and raw sugar are expected to increase the net export position of the region by 17% between the baseline period 2020-22 and 2032. Eastern Europe and Central Asia became a net exporting region in 2008. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent privatisation of state and collectively owned enterprises including farms led to significant productivity gains that boosted agricultural production. The limited domestic demand, due to stagnating population and per capita consumption, combined with a strong economic relationship with booming Asia contributed to the export expansion of the region. However, while Europe and Central Asia are projected to maintain a strong net exporting position, their past increase in trade surpluses of is expected to slow down in the short run because Russia’s war against Ukraine is hampering growth in agricultural production and exports from these countries, with more profound impacts on the Ukrainian agricultural sector related to limited marketing opportunities, low farm gate prices and high input costs. In the medium term, the Outlook assumes that production and exports of these two countries will return to their pre-war trends. Western Europe (Figure 1.37, panel b) is a net importing region for the agricultural commodities covered in the Outlook, but a net exporter of processed food products. Western Europe’s net trade deficit will decrease due to slower demand growth. North America is expected to remain the second largest exporter of agricultural commodities to world markets over the next ten years, but its continued strong domestic consumption growth is expected to slightly slow down the progression of its net exporting position. In Oceania, Australia and New Zealand are traditional net exporters of agricultural commodities. Over the coming decade, the region is expected to continue maintaining their net trade position, due to continued efforts to increase its access to other market through the negotiation of preferential trade agreements.  61 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.37.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/fwb8az Deepening net importing positions from regions with fastest population growth Import patterns have changed significantly due to the substantial and continuous growth in demand for food and agriculture products from population booms and resource-constrained regions. Asia, with about 60% of the current world population, has seen its import demand more than quadruple in 30 years; this demand has been largely driven by rapid developments in China. China’s net import position more than doubled over the last ten years and peaked in 2020 to represent 48% of the overall Asian trade deficit as the ASF outbreak caused a surge in its import demand; the country’s exports remained broadly stable. The projected decrease in Chinese population growth will result in a stabilisation of its food consumption and feed use over the coming decade, implying that Asia’s net trade deficit will increase by 11% only, in contrast to when it doubled between 2010 and 2020. -120 -70 -20 30 80 North America Latin America and the Caribbean Europe and Central Asia South and Southeast Asia Sub Saharan Africa Near East and North Africa Developed and East Asia Bln USD Panel a 2000-02 2010-12 2020-22 2032 -120 -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 Brazil Oceania USA Russia Western Europe China Bln USD Panel b 2000-02 2010-12 2020-22 2032 62  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 With the fastest growing population, Sub-Saharan Africa is the third largest net importing region of agricultural commodities, notably of cereals that support food security both directly and through their use as animal feed. In Sub-Saharan Africa, imports (mainly of maize, rice, wheat, and soybeans) are projected to grow strongly over the coming decade, as population growth is expected to outpace output growth. As a result, the region’s trade deficit is projected to further increase by 77% between 2022 and 2032. In the Near East and North Africa region, imports are projected to continue expanding over the next ten years, while exports are expected to decline, increasing the net trade deficit of the region by a further 32% until 2032. Strong population growth and limited growth in domestic production due to natural resource constraints underpin these trends. Trade liberalisation at the multilateral and regional levels has fostered greater participation in international markets. Box 1.3 looks at the evidence of globalisation and regionalisation of agricultural trade and highlights the role of trade policies in shaping the geography of trade. The global food and agricultural market has become more resilient, but many countries remain vulnerable to the impact of trade shocks on food security. Box 1.3. From globalisation to regionalisation Agricultural trade has been more resilient than industrial trade but is nevertheless affected by the transformation of global supply chains After booming in the 1990s and the 2000s, the pace of globalisation stalled due to the global financial crisis, the deadlock in multilateral liberalisation negotiations, and diminishing civil society support for mega regional trade agreements. Trade in food and agricultural products showed more resilience than industrial trade during the COVID-19 pandemic. While sustained global cooperation and supportive trade policies maintained a well-functioning global agricultural market (unlike during the 2008 food crisis) (Figure 1.38), agricultural global supply chains are evolving towards greater regionalisation. Figure 1.38. Growth in agricultural and industrial trade Source: COMTRADE and World Bank World Development Indicators. StatLink 2https://stat.link/uxij24 At present, more countries are trading and the global agrifood market is less concentrated and more decentralised than in 1995 because of the greater participation of low- and middle-income countries. Before the creation of the WTO, a few large trading hubs dominated the trade network.

This trade integration has been an important driver of the diffusion of technology and knowledge necessary to promote productivity and overall growth. The regionalisation of food and agricultural trade – the tendency of countries to trade more within a region than with countries outside the region – increased between 1995 and 2019. Within the global food and agricultural trade network, countries tend to form particular trade clusters and to trade more within them. These clusters may be regional, or they may expand to include countries across regions. They are often shaped by geographic proximity and economic integration fostered by trade agreements. The global network of food and agricultural trade has become more balanced. Today, more countries are connected to more trade partners, which can strengthen the buffer capacity and resilience of the network. Several network indicators show that the connectivity of countries to the global network of food and agricultural trade has increased (Figure 1.39, Panel a). The higher the connectivity, the more countries are connected directly with each other (direct connectivity) and with countries that are themselves connected to many others (indirect connectivity). Connectivity can be measured by the number of links or by the value of products that are traded via these links. Figure 1.39. Average connectivity between countries in the global food and agricultural trade network, 1995-2019 Note: Connectivity is measured by the number of trade links, i.e. import or export flows between countries. The higher the connectivity, the more countries are connected directly with each other (direct connectivity) and with countries that are themselves connected to many others (eigenvector or “indirect” connectivity). The closeness index indicates how “close” a country is to all other countries in the network. It is measured by counting the shortest paths, where each short path is defined as the strongest link, that is the link with the highest trade intensity (value of import or export flows of a country), between two countries. The higher the closeness index, the more central a country is located in the network and the “closer” it is to all other countries. Source: Jafari, Engemann and Zimmermann (2022[15]).

The direct connectivity index counts the number of trade links that a country has within the global network of food and agricultural trade and is normalised by the total number of possible links in the network. The eigenvector connectivity further counts the trade links of all direct trade partners. The closeness connectivity index counts the shortest paths, where each short path represents the link with the highest trade intensity, between two countries. The higher the closeness index, the more central a country is located in the network and the “closer” it is to all other countries. Historically, countries with similar income per capita tended to trade more amongst each other, reflecting similar tastes and preferences. However, with the increasing participation of low- and middle\u0002income countries in global food and agricultural markets, high trade intensity was more likely to take place between countries of a different income group in 2019 than in 1995 (Figure 1.39, Panel b). The assortativity index by regions suggests that countries within a region tend to trade more with each other than with countries in other regions. The more pronounced regionalisation of agrifood trade is often shaped by geographic proximity and economic integration forged by regional trade agreements (RTAs). Only a few countries continue to account for most of the value traded and only a few source a large variety of food and agricultural products from many different exporters. The fact that imports of most countries are concentrated on a few products from a limited number of trade partners makes them vulnerable to shocks in exporter markets. To improve their resilience and to ensure food security and healthy diets, countries should aim to diversify products imported and to increase the number of trading partners. Source: FAO (2022[16]). 1.4.4. Trade plays a key role in ensuring food security and farmer livelihoods International trade forms the backbone of the global food system. When the terms of trade are determined by comparative advantage and economies of scale, mutually beneficial trade can improve the availability and affordability of different foods and offer a wider choice for consumers. Trade is particularly important for resource-constrained countries, which are highly dependent on the import of basic and high-value commodities. Trade is also a driver of economic growth as it creates opportunities for producers, including smallholders, to access additional markets. Exports of agricultural commodities that account for a large share of domestic production in some countries are therefore an important source of income. Figure 1.40 illustrates the share of exports in total production (panel a) and the share of imports in total consumption (panel b) for selected regions, measured in calorie equivalent. These shares should be put in perspective with the historical and projected developments of the net trade positions presented in Figure 1.37. At the global level, while net exporting and net importing positions are projected to deepen, the share of trade in production and consumption is expected to remain stable over the coming decade, suggesting they are proportional to production. Large producing regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean and North America tend to export (including via intra-regional trade) a large share of their domestic production, at 42% and 32%, respectively in the baseline period 2020-22, and are expected to maintain these shares for the former or slightly reduce it for the latter in 2032. The Europe and Central Asia region is expected to increase its share of exports in domestic production from 27% in 2020-22 to 29% in 2032 (Figure 1.40, panel a). The role of trade in providing a wider range of food is confirmed by the fact that even large net exporting regions rely on imports for their domestic consumption. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for instance, imports account for about 22% of total demand for commodities covered in the Outlook (Figure 1.40, panel b).  65 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 In the Near East and North Africa region, where the population is growing strongly and water resource constraints limit production response, imports play a significant role in complementing domestic food and feed production. Imports accounted for 71% of total demand of agricultural commodities in the region in 2020-22, a share that is expected to remain stable over the coming decade. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the share of imports in total demand was lower, at 20% in 2020-22. However, this share is expected to reach 22% by 2032 as growth in domestic production will not keep up with high population growth (Figure 1.40, panel b). Insufficient infrastructure supporting the development of trade, but also the prominence of informal cross-border trade in the region, can explain the relatively low level of imports in consumption goods.

Moreover, energy price hikes and the sustained price volatility resulting from Russia’s war against Ukraine have had a big impact on transportation costs and their evolution remains subject to high uncertainty. The recent price surge and volatility have revived the risk of countries imposing export restricting measures to keep domestic food inflation in check. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) presentation given during the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) initiative webinar “Ukraine One Year Later – The Impact of the War on Agricultural Markets and Food Security” (AMIS, 2023[17]), at least 20 countries have imposed a limit on exports since the war began. Yet export bans are only aggravating the adverse effect of price uncertainties and can only push prices further up. They have a negative impact on global food security (and livelihoods) in the short term, and undermine supply capacity in the long term. Increasing concerns on the role of globalisation in global warming, the depletion of natural resources, deforestation, and biodiversity loss support growing demands for more sustainable food and agricultural trade. However, the agricultural support policies and unilateral trade policy approaches adopted to pursue climate change mitigation objectives can create important distortions on production and trade. Developments in trade policies that will be negotiated and implemented over the coming decade could have significant impacts. The Outlook includes only policies that are currently in place and holds them constant over the medium term; this constitutes a source of uncertainty as any change in policies over the coming decade will affect the projections. New trade agreements (e.g. Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, EU-Mercosur), for instance, will potentially increase intra-regional and inter-regional trade over the next ten years. 1.5. Prices The Outlook uses prices recorded in the main international markets for each commodity as international reference prices. In addition to market fundamentals, current prices are influenced by the effects of short\u0002term demand and supply shocks, such as economic and political shocks (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts), and annual weather fluctuations. In addition, speculation within the context of portfolio investment decisions can influence prices at certain points in time. As the effects of these shocks are largely unpredictable and cannot be incorporated into the projections, prices in the Outlook are assumed to return to their long-term trends, which are determined by demand and supply fundamentals. 1.5.1. Agricultural price trends and main drivers Productivity gains the key to production increases Current real prices (i.e. adjusted for inflation) for most agricultural commodities covered in the Outlook are high by historical comparison, but have started to fall in 2022 and are expected to continue downward over the coming decade returning to their projected longer-term trend level (Figure 1.41). Real prices of agricultural commodities have been on a declining trend since the 1960s due to rising productivity, which lowers the marginal cost of production of food commodities. Prior to 1990, most output growth at the global level was driven by intensifying land use and increasing the area under cultivation, as well as extending irrigation. After 1990, growth in total factor productivity (TFP, i.e. output expressed relative to total inputs used in production) accounted for most of the growth in world output. The emergence of new technologies in the 1990s contributed to improved yields and led to falling marginal production costs, resulting in lower food prices despite rising food demand, especially in high-, upper and lower middle-income countries.3 Looking forward, yield increases will continue to be the main driver of production increases as the availability of new land is limited. However, sustained agricultural productivity growth may  67 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 be threatened in the longer-term as average temperatures exceed the biological thresholds of many crop and livestock species.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/rb2v60 Many real prices of agricultural commodities rose substantially in 2020 and 2021, and rose or remained high in 2022. This was due to the recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, tight global supplies because of higher production costs (mainly energy and fertiliser) due mainly to supply chain disruptions. Poor weather affected harvests in several important producing countries. In addition, Russia’s war against Ukraine reduced harvests of key crops in 2022 in Ukraine. The Outlook projects that real prices of agricultural commodities will fall more rapidly in the early years of the projection period as the factors that underpinned the price increases subside; real prices will then resume their projected long-term declining trend, consistent with supply and demand fundamentals expected over the next decade. These projections take into account income and population growth, combined with prevailing consumer trends that influence demand, and continued productivity growth increasing supply. The FAO Food Price Index (FPI) shows the development of international reference prices of major traded food commodities in a single indicator, and it is aligned with the projections for the commodities covered in the report (Figure 1.42). 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 1960196219641966196819701972197419761978198019821984198619881990199219941996199820002002200420062008201020122014201620182020202220242026202820302032 (2019=100) Soybeans Wheat Maize Beef Pork 68  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.42.

Commodity price trends The grain price spike was due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, and the high input, energy and transport costs. Prices of wheat and maize peaked in 2022, and they are expected to remain higher than their pre-COVID-19 levels in 2023. However, assuming average yields and a broad geopolitical stability grain prices will return towards their long-term trends. Falling wheat prices and recovering rice prices indicate the rice-to-wheat price ratio approach long-term, pre-COVID-19 levels. As cereal prices revert to their projected long-term trend, the co-movement of wheat and rice prices will maintain or return to their historic ratio. Oilseed prices increased rapidly since 2021 largely due to strong demand, especially for soybeans from China, where hog herds were being rebuilt following the African swine fever (ASF) outbreak necessitating higher feed use. In addition, lower production of soybeans in South America and rapeseed in Canada, combined with Indonesia’s export restrictions on palm oil and reduced sunflower oil exportable availabilities following the outbreak of the Russia’s war against Ukraine pushed up prices further. After reaching all-time highs in early 2022, international prices for oilseeds and derived products started to fall, mainly on account of prospects of a record soybean harvest in Brazil and ample vegetable oil supplies following the relaxation of restrictive export measures in Indonesia. In the longer-run, oilseed and protein meal prices are expected to decline in real terms while vegetable oil prices could increase in nominal and real terms due to strong demand and constrained production growth as palm oil plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia are maturing and arable land available for oilseeds cultivation in the European Union and China is limited. Real sugar prices also peaked in 2021 as exports from Brazil were reduced at a time of strong global demand. Higher global production in 2022/23, mainly due to better harvests in Brazil and Thailand, is reflected in higher availability, causing sugar prices to further fall in the near term, although this decline is dampened by still high input prices. The downward trend in sugar prices will continue over the longer-term, due to rising productivity and slowing demand growth. However, stable international crude oil prices are expected to partially offset downward pressure on sugar prices. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 Index 2014-16=100 FAO Food Price Index (nominal) FAO Food Price Index (real)  69 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Real biofuel prices rose dramatically in 2020 and 2022, driven by high feedstock prices and higher labour costs. Real feedstock prices (i.e. sugarcane, molasses, maize, and vegetable oil) are expected to return to their projected long-term trend over the projection period and biofuel prices are expected to decline and stabilise, although at a higher level than in 2014-2020. However, biofuel production and consumption, and hence prices, will remain heavily influenced by policies, such as blending mandates and domestic support measures. The higher biofuel to fossil fuel price ratios in 2020 and 2021 reflected high feedstock prices combined with relatively low oil prices. As feedstock prices decline over the projection period, this ratio is expected to revert to historic levels (Figure 1.45). In this regard, the assumption in the Outlook of mandates that bind the demand for biofuels with fossil fuel, will contribute to the stability of their relative price. Figure 1.43.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/b86vqy Real meat prices rebounded in 2021 and 2022, reflecting higher demand following the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increased transportation and marketing costs. Meat prices are projected to decline in 2023 and continue to gradually fall in real terms over the next decade as demand weakens, supply chains stabilise, productivity continues to grow and feed costs decrease (Figure 1.46). Pigmeat prices are expected to decline more than prices for other meats due to the recovery of production following the ASF outbreak, especially in China, Viet Nam, and the Philippines. Figure 1.46.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/e1cdyp About 93% of global milk production is consumed domestically in the form of fresh, unprocessed, or lightly processed (e.g. pasteurised or fermented) dairy products. Marginal productivity is assumed to improve in dairy sectors across the world leading to a gradual decline in real prices for these fresh dairy products. Higher international prices in 2021 and 2022 were driven by high demand, high inputs costs and tight supply from the main exporters. International dairy prices are expected to fall in the short-term and return to the longer-term pre-COVID-19 trend as supply chain disruptions ease and marginal costs decline. Global price developments in the dairy sector are mainly determined by trends in the international prices of butter and skim milk powder (SMP), which set the value of milk fat and non-fat milk solids, respectively. Both SMP and butter prices were expected to remain high in 2022 mainly due to high production costs and strong demand: the latter also affected by high vegetable oil prices, with the price of butter increasing more than vegetable oils through 2022 (Figure 1.48). SMP and butter prices are expected to start decreasing thereafter and to resume their long-term declining trends as supplies respond to current price signals. Real prices of cheese and whole milk powder (WMP) also track developments of butter and SMP prices, respectively. Real fish prices rose in 2021 and 2022 due to high demand at both household and food service levels, following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the modest supply response to growing demand. After 2023, real prices for capture fish are projected to decline while for aquaculture and fish oil there is a modest upward trend. Real prices for aquatic food are projected to remain flat while fishmeal prices fluctuate around a flat trend. Although over the longer-term real prices of fish are projected to decline or remain largely flat, fluctuations over the next decade are expected because of recurring El Niño conditions that limit capture in the Pacific. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 (2009-11=1) Pig meat/Feed Index Poulty/Feed Index Beef/Feed Index 72  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.48.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/tuibwg 1.5.3. Transmission of price signals within the global food system While the international reference prices used in the Outlook characterise global markets, their actual impact on the decisions of producers and consumers is thought to be indirect. In domestic markets, individual producers and consumers are mainly price takers and their aggregate behaviour determines domestic reference prices. Globally aggregated production and consumption decisions drive international reference prices. The formation and transmission of these price signals depend on the integration of domestic markets into the global trading system, currency movements, and the cost of trade. How price signals are transmitted between domestic and international markets depends on the share of the domestic consumption that is imported or of the domestic production that is exported, as well as on the responsiveness of domestic prices to trade. In countries with a small share in global markets, a well\u0002developed trade infrastructure and/or high substitutability of trade for domestic products, domestic market shocks are absorbed quickly through trade, and domestic prices are not affected. Major producer and consumer countries transmit their domestic market trends and variability more directly into the global market. By contrast, countries having only very limited interaction with the global market, i.e. those with high self-sufficiency, are mostly, but not always, shielded from shocks transmitted by global price movements, yet they are more exposed to domestic shocks. Price transmissions are also affected by trade policies, where restrictive policies can effectively dampen the transmission of price volatility to domestic markets. However, when restrictive policies are implemented by countries that account for a large share of the market, or when such policies are implemented collectively, they are likely to exacerbate price volatility. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 Ratio Cheese/butter Skimmed milk powder/butter Cheese/skimmed milk powder Butter/vegetable oil  73 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 1.49.

Many uncertainties in the next decade mean price projections need to be interpreted with care Price projections presented in this Outlook result from the interplay of fundamental supply and demand factors under normal weather, macroeconomic and policy assumptions. The Outlook is based on the best information available, but there is an unavoidable degree of uncertainty attached to the projections and to the underlying assumptions. Until a mutually agreeable solution is identified, Russia’s war against Ukraine will continue to add uncertainties to energy, input, and agricultural commodities prices. At the onset of the war, reduced availability of grains, oilseeds and fertilisers was of major concern for global markets. More than one year after the start of the war in February 2022, market access issues have somewhat improved thanks to the enforcement and subsequent extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, as well as expanding capacity of rail, road and river based export channels from Ukraine via the European Union-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes. However, high and volatile energy prices remain an important factor in food price inflation. In addition, the possible use of trade restrictions and subsidies by some countries to manage domestic inflation is a further source of uncertainty. And in the longer-term, climate change and environmental policies may cause market disruptions. 50 150 250 350 450 2012 2017 2022 2027 2032 USD/t Maize (cv = 0.26) 200 300 400 500 600 700 2012 2017 2022 2027 2032 USD/t Rice (cv = 0.18) 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 2012 2017 2022 2027 2032 USD/t Vegetable oil (cv = 0.23) 800 1300 1800 2300 2800 3300 2012 2017 2022 2027 2032 USD/t Poultry (cv = 0.23) 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 2012 2017 2022 2027 2032 USD/t Butter (cv = 0.18) 25 35 45 55 65 75 85 2012 2017 2022 2027 2032 USD/hl Ethanol (cv = 0.16) 90% interval 75% interval Baseline 74  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The assumption of normality in this Outlook results in a smooth trajectory for most projected variables, deviations from the assumed trends causing price volatility. To assess the impact of such deviations, a partial stochastic analysis (PSA) was performed on the baseline projections. The PSA simulates the potential future variability of main price determinants using observed past variability. The analysis includes global macroeconomic drives and specific agricultural crop yields. Variability related to animal disease or policy changes is not considered. The aggregated results of multiple PSA simulations indicate the sensitivity of the baseline price paths (Figure 1.49). With likelihood of 75%, prices will remain within the blue range in any given year while they are expected to remain with a probability of 90% within the green range. An extreme event that would cause a price to fall entirely outside these ranges occurs with a probability of 40% at least once during the projection period. Overall, the price variability range is considerably larger than that estimated for last year’s Outlook. This is most pronounced for vegetable oil, rice, poultry and maize. Notably, the variability is generally much larger above the baseline.  75 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 References AMIS (2023), Ukraine One Year Later - The Impact of the War on Agricultural Markets and Food Security, https://www.amis-outlook.org/events/detail/en/c/1156244/ (accessed on 12 April 2023).

It highlights the regional aspects of production, consumption, and trade projections for the period 2023-32, and provides background information on key regional issues. 2 Regional briefs 78  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The regional briefs in the Outlook highlight broad trends for the regions defined by the FAO in the implementation of its global workplan. Recognising regional diversity, the intention is not to compare results across regions. Instead, they illustrate some of the latest regional developments, highlighting responses to global challenges and emerging trends, and relating these to the main messages of the Outlook. The assessments generally compare the end point of the Outlook’s projection (2032) to the base period of 2020-22. The large and diverse Asia Pacific region has been disaggregated into two separate parts: Developed and East Asia, and South and Southeast Asia. Agriculture and food systems globally have faced multiple disruptions in recent years – first in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequently the impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine. The subsequent rise in food prices has impacted affordability and food security in multiple regions. These briefs do not present a quantitative assessment of the impacts of these disruptions, though they do account for the latest expectations with respect to macro-economic developments as the world emerges from these disruptions. The trends and issues presented are those expected to underpin the Outlook in the medium term. They assume that the adverse effects on food, feed and fuel production, consumption and trade will gradually moderate, recognising that several uncertainties remain. This chapter contains seven sections, with text, tabular and graphic information for each region following a similar template. A background section provides the key regional characteristics and provides the setting from which the projection is described in the subsequent sections for production, consumption, and trade. Each regional brief contains an annex providing common charts and tables outlining the key aspects for the region. 2.1. Regional Outlook: Developed and East Asia 2.1.1. Background Rapid urbanisation driving demand preferences The Developed and East Asia region,1 with its 1.6 billion people, is the second most populous of those covered in this Chapter, with the overwhelming majority living in The People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”). It is also the only region where the population is expected to decline over the coming decade. The region encompasses a diverse range of countries, that play a central role in global markets. This includes China and Japan, the second and third largest economies in the world. Considered on a per capita basis, income levels range from USD 8 789 in China to USD 62 344 in Australia. The region has urbanized rapidly, and estimates suggest that by 2032, 74% of people will reside in urban settings, up from just 55% in 2010. Such urbanisation contributes to dietary change, including the associated rising consumption of higher value, processed and conveniently packaged food, and consequently contributes to rapid transformation of food systems. Income growth in the region has been resilient in the face of numerous exogenous shocks. The decline in per capita GDP of only 0.6% in 2020 makes it one of the least affected economically by the pandemic, though clear differences exist across countries, with sharp decreases Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, offset by continued growth in China of 2.0%. Its recovery was also one of the fastest. Regional growth rebounded by 5.7% in 2021, with broad recovery amongst all countries ‒ to the extent that average per capita income in 2021 was already 5.1% higher than in 2019. Despite ongoing war in Ukraine, the consequent increase in energy prices and spiralling inflation, per capita income expanded further by 2.9% in 2022 and is expected to rise by 3.5% in 2023 as China continues to lift pandemic related restrictions. While positive, this marks a sharp slowdown from historic norms and near-term growth prospects face many risks, including a more constrained global environment where demand is softer, commodity prices are falling, inflation is high and monetary policies are tightening. In the medium term, per capita incomes  79 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 are projected to grow by 3.4% per year, implying incomes in 2032 that are 45% higher than the average of the base period. Rising income will be a key driver of demand in China, while consumer preferences may be more important in the high income developed countries. The region’s agricultural resource base is as diverse as the countries included in it. Severe resource constraints in China, Korea and Japan are contrasted by abundance in both Australia and New Zealand. The share in the economy of primary agriculture and fish value added has declined to about 5% and is expected to fall further to 4% by 2032. Economic growth has been accompanied by a reduction in the share of food in total household expenditure to 14%, but it ranges in the region from 18% in China to 8% in Australia. Prevailing high prices and affordability challenges could have a notable impact on food security within the region, but global shocks may be muted to some degree by domestic protection in various countries.2 The region encompasses a range of important exporters and importers of agricultural and food products. China and Japan are the largest and second largest net food commodity importers in the world, while Korea is the sixth largest.3 These countries trade sufficiently to have a notable impact on global agricultural markets and value chains. New Zealand and Australia are among the top 10 global net exporters of food commodities in value terms, particularly for livestock and dairy products. Based on specialisation in the region, there is extensive and growing interregional trade. Apart from Australia and New Zealand, interventionist government policies are influential in local markets. Changes to such domestic policies have the potential to impact global markets significantly, due to the size and contribution to global trade from the countries in which they are imposed. The challenges facing the region are as numerous as they are diverse. Natural resource constraints in China, Korea, and Japan have led to intensive application of purchased inputs, and growing sustainability concerns. In some areas, water resources have reached critically low levels and parts of the region are highly vulnerable to climate change. Increasingly severe droughts are occurring more frequently, particularly in Australia, a situation that will likely persist and possibly intensify due to climate change. Amongst the major threats specific to meat production are animal diseases such as ASF and Avian Influenza. The extent of impact from the ASF outbreak in China in 2018 serves to highlight the importance of improved measures required to manage these threats. Despite these challenges, agricultural value addition per unit of land used for agricultural purposes continues to rise. Total factor productivity growth over the last decade is estimated at 1.6% p.a., down from 2% p.a. in the preceding decade.4 Considering resource constraints, continued investments in productivity growth in the region will be critical to future sustainability. 2.1.2. Production China driving production growth The region is the second largest global producer of agriculture and fish commodities, contributing almost a fifth of the value of global output in the 2020-22 base period. By 2032, 9% growth in the net value of production results in a modest decline in its share in global production. China is central in the region’s output. In the 2020-22 base period, it already accounted for almost 90% of total value and Figure 2.1 indicates that it is also the sole driver of growth over the outlook period. While China is expected to add 10% to its agriculture and fish production value by 2032, the rest of the region contracts by 3%, mainly due to reduced output in Australia and Japan. Aside from recovery in the livestock sector following African Swine Fever (ASF), growth in the region as a whole has slowed with maturing domestic markets, evolving policies, and strengthened trade competition. The regions crop sector accounts for 38% of total agriculture and fish output in the base period, although accounting for fruits and vegetables would increase this contribution. Growth of only 4% implies that the 80  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 share of crops in total agricultural value added could decline to 36% by 2032. Most of this decline is picked up by fish production, which could account for 27% of total value added by 2032, while the livestock sector sustains its share at 37%. Total land used for agricultural purposes is expected to decline slightly by 2032, in line with historic trends. This reflects a reduction in pasture, as land used for crop production is expected to expand by 5%, almost exclusively in Australia. Resource constraints in the rest of the region suggest that productivity gains must be central to growth. The value generated per hectare of cropland is already higher in Developed and East Asia than any other region and is expected to remain fairly stable towards 2032. d While some yield gains are expected, due to progress in new seed varieties, improved production practices and expanded irrigation, these are generally slower than in the past. There are mounting environmental and food safety concerns, due to water scarcity, and the fact that synthetic fertiliser use, on a per hectare basis, is already the highest amongst all regions. Fertiliser application per hectare could rise further over the outlook period, albeit slowly, but the projected crop mix and productivity gains are such that the energy produced per unit of fertiliser applied is also expected to rise by 5%. The region’s crop area is dominated by cereals. Its contribution to global production is notable for several crops, including rice, maize and wheat. Its processing sector also contributes a substantial share of protein meal and vegetable oil produced in the world, but it relies mostly on imported oilseeds. Almost all maize produced in the region is attributed to China, which also contributes 93% of its rice output and 80% of wheat. The balance of wheat production is almost exclusively from Australia. China is expected to expand its area under maize production by 2.3 Mha over the coming decade which, combined with yield gains of 0.7% p.a., fuels production growth of 12% by 2032. Conversely, the area cultivated to rice and wheat is expected to contract by 1.2 Mha and 1.3 Mha respectively. Yield gains are sufficient to induce a 2% expansion in rice production, and maintain wheat production at current levels, despite the area contraction. In Australia, the only other notable wheat producer in the region, production is expected to contract by 16% relative to the base period, reflecting a 5% reduction in area harvested, as well as a normalisation in yields from record levels attained in 2022. Almost all of the decline in regional wheat production is attributed to Australia. Livestock production constitutes 37% of the total value of agricultural and fish production and growth of 9% is sufficient to sustain this share by 2032. Growth emanates mainly from intensification and productivity gains, reflecting the contracting pasture land base in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. More than three quarters of meat production growth from the region is expected to be pigmeat, with a further 11% attributed to poultry. China remains the largest contributor to livestock production in the region, accounting for almost 80% of livestock production value. Pigmeat and poultry are the biggest sectors, constituting 58% and 28% of total Chinese meat production respectively. Meat production in China is expected to grow by 14% over the next ten years and 80% of the additional meat produced will be Pigmeat. Following the devastating impact of the 2018 African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreak, China’s pig herd has largely been rebuilt and in 2022, its pig herd inventory surpassed 2017 levels. Pigmeat production in 2032 is expected to be 8% higher than in 2022, reflecting large scale intensification in the sector as it recovered from ASF. Many smaller producers were replaced by large, commercial production units that prioritise biosecurity. The effects of ASF in the recent past also initiated growth in poultry production, which has a short production cycle and was able to respond the fastest to high meat prices in China at the height of ASF. From 2018 to 2022, poultry production expanded by 20%, but the recovery in pigmeat production and subsequent normalisation in prices results in further growth of only 4.5% by 2032. Despite its much smaller share in total meat production from the Developed and East Asian region, Australia’s resource base is more conducive to bovine animals, which account for almost half of its total meat production. In turn, Australia contributes 20% of bovine meat production from the region. Growth of 0.8% per annum implies that it will also be a major driver of expanding regional bovine meat production.  81 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The Developed and East Asian region contributes almost 40% of global fish production and 90% is sourced in China. China is also the major driver of fish production growth in the region, which is projected at 1.3% per annum. Growth is much faster in aquaculture, at 1.5% p.a. over the coming decade, compared to only 0.6% p.a. in captured fisheries. Consequently, aquaculture could account for almost 78% of total production from the region by 2032. Given its central role in regional production, the policy environment in China, which has increasingly prioritised sustainability in recent years, will guide fish market developments. Total agricultural GHG emissions by the region are projected to increase by 5.1% by 2032. Emissions from animal sources are projected to rise by 5.1%, reflecting a 7% and 3% rise in bovine herds and sheep flocks respectively. Crop related emissions also rise by 4.6% over the ten-year period. Nevertheless, when considered relative to the value generated from agriculture and fisheries, the decline in GHG emissions per unit value produced is expected to continue, albeit at a slower rate. 2.1.3. Consumption Dietary change in China driving increased meat consumption The East Asian region has made great strides in improving food security and the impact of the pandemic was smaller than in most other regions. While COVID-19 undoubtedly influenced consumer behaviour and agriculture supply chains, GDP performance was fairly resilient, particularly in China, and income support measures in developed countries further mitigated large scale impacts on food security. Despite the marginal increase in the prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020, the recovery in 2021 was such that it reached its lowest level in five years, despite rising prices. Total calorie availability increased in 2022 and is expected to rise again in 2023, despite high inflation and the surging cost of living. By 2032, total calorie availability is expected to rise by 6%, around 200 kcal/person/day to reach 3473 kcal/person/day. This is the second highest among all regions and reflects the generally high per capita income levels in most countries. However, corrected for estimated household waste, total calorie intake is expected below 3239 kcal/person/day. Various trends in population dynamics affect countries across the region. Populations in many parts of the region are aging, with dependency ratios5in Japan and Korea already high and set to increase further by 2030 (UN DESA, 2020[1]). It is generally assumed that the aging population trend will have a dampening effect on overall food consumption growth rates in these countries. Conversely, rapid urbanisation, particularly in China, drives growing consumption of convenience foods, and meats, fats, and sugars, which will outpace most other food groups. Sugar consumption is expected to grow fastest among the various food groups and while vegetable oil consumption growth is slower, absolute levels are already high. By 2032, it is expected to approach 28 kg per capita, exceeding the global average by 70%. Given the level of incomes, development, and maturity in most countries of the region, the greatest shift in dietary composition is set to occur in China. By 2032, per capita consumption of sugar products is expected to rise by 15%, whereas fish, meat and dairy consumption are set to expand by 14%, 12% and 12% respectively. These rates contrast with growth of less than 0.5% in cereal consumption, underscoring the extent of dietary change expected. Increased meat consumption will also result in increased protein availability, with an expected gain of 10g/person/year by 2032. This brings total protein availability in the region to 118g/person/year – more than 30% above the global average. Most of this gain is expected in China, while small increases are also evident in Korea and Japan. In Australia and New Zealand, protein availability is expected to decline relative to 2020-22, mainly due to reduced dairy product consumption, but from high base levels. At regional level, per capita fish consumption is also expected to grow by 13% or 5 kg per capita by 2032 relative to the base period. This includes strong growth of 14% in China, smaller gains of 6% in Australia, 5% in New Zealand and 4% in Korea, along with relative stability in Japan. 82  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The region accounts for just over a quarter of global animal feed use. By 2032, the use of animal feed is expected to increase by 11%, sustaining the regions share in global use at current levels. Several factors combine to determine total feed use, including the intensity of feeding across different production systems and the efficiency of feed conversion by different species. Differences in production practices and predominant species are prevalent across countries. More than 85% of the feed used in the region is attributed to China, where total feed use is expected to rise by 13% by 2032. This encapsulates rising demand from increasingly intensive pigmeat and poultry operations. These large scale, fully commercial systems use feed more intensively than smaller, more traditional producers, but the combination of controlled environment and improved genetics also yields much improved feed conversion. Considering this combination of factors total animal feed use in China is expected to grow marginally slower than meat production. Conversely, dairy, beef and sheep production systems in Australia and New Zealand are more flexible in terms of feed use intensity and more reliant on pasture. Thus, growth in total feed use is slower. In feed-intensive production systems, maize and protein meal remain the core ingredients in most pre\u0002mixed feed rations and account for almost 70% of total feed raw material use between them. Their use in animal feed across the region is expected to grow by 15% and 11% respectively over the coming decade, with the slower rate in protein meal reflecting China’s efforts to reduce protein inclusion in rations. While wheat constitutes a much smaller share of total feed, its use is expected to grow by 21% over the coming decade. The region accounts for roughly 10% of global ethanol use and almost 80% of this is attributed to China. In 2017, China announced an ambitious E10 mandate with targeted implementation across the country by 2020 and the aim of reducing excessive maize stocks. Stocks have since normalised, providing limited incentive to expand ethanol production. The Outlook therefore assumes that blending rates will increase to only 1.7% by 2032, an increase from the 1.2% average over the base period, but well below the ambitious 10% target. With total gasoline use expected to decline, the increased blending rate sustains China’s ethanol consumption growth at 1.1% p.a. over the ten-year period. By 2032, China will still only account for approximately 7% of global ethanol production. 2.1.4. Trade Diverse group of net importers and exporters The region’s trade deficit is foreseen to stabilise over the coming decade, but it remains the biggest net importer amongst those covered in the Outlook. This position mainly emanates from imports into East Asia, particularly China and Japan, and masks net exports from the Oceanic region. The major products imported into the East Asian region include soybeans, maize, barley, sorghum, wheat, vegetable oil and livestock products. The Oceanic region is a significant net exporter of wheat, barley, canola, sugar, meat, and dairy products. The net value of imports into the region is expected to rise 7% by 2032 relative to the 2020-22 base period – a significant slowdown compared to the past decade. Almost three-quarters of the additional imports accrue to China, the largest soybean importer in the world. China’s soybean imports reached an all-time high in 2020, despite the logistical challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Import demand was driven by rapid growth in poultry production, as well as the recovery in its pig herd post ASF. Imports have subsequently slowed in the current high price environment, but by 2032 are expected to rise by a further 6% due to further livestock production growth and fewer trade related challenges. Despite the slowdown in growth relative to the past, China will still account for 60% of global soybean trade, with the bulk of products sourced from Brazil, the United States and Argentina. While growing animal feed use is also driving demand for maize, imports are set to decline because of strong domestic production growth. By 2032, China is expected to produce almost 95% of its total maize use yet will still account for 9% of global maize trade.  83 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Meat imports into the region are set to decline by 14% over the next ten years, mainly due to the 25% reduction in imports into China, given that its own production has recovered from the impacts of ASF. Bovine and to a much lesser extent ovine are the only meat types where China is expected to increase imports. In the rest of the region, Korean meat imports are set to expand by 12%, but its contribution to total imports into the region is much smaller. Part of East Asia’s meat import requirement will likely be met by rising exports from Oceania, which is favourably located to supply Asian markets. Australia is already amongst the top 5 suppliers of bovine meat into China and bilateral trade relations have improved. Australia’s bovine exports are expected to grow by 19% to reach 1.8 Mt by 2032. The additional 290 Kt supplied from Australia by 2032, however, only equates to a third of China’s expected import growth for bovine meat. The Oceanic region is a major exporter of numerous other products, but several of these are expected to contract over the coming decade. Wheat exports are expected to decline, but Australia remains an important global supplier, particularly amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has constrained exports from the Black Sea region. By 2032, Australia is still expected to constitute 10% of global wheat exports. Despite its small land area, New Zealand accounts for more than 30% of global sheepmeat exports and for 23% of the world’s dairy exports. With pastureland increasingly constrained and set to decline further by 2032, sheepmeat exports are projected to remain stable, while dairy exports grow by a modest 6%. Consequently, New Zealand’s share in global exports is expected to decline for both products. Figure 2.1.

Regional outlook: South and Southeast Asia 2.2.1. Background Population and robust income growth support strong demand, putting pressure on resources The South and Southeast Asia region is home to 34% of the global population, making it the most populous region amongst those covered in this Chapter. Just over half of its 2.7 billion people reside in India. Urbanisation is rising across the region and the share of population residing in urban areas is expected to surpass 46% by 2032, from an average of 41% in 2020-22. On average, income levels amount to USD 3 157 per capita, which is at the lower end of the global spectrum, but it includes a diverse range of countries. Amongst its least developed nations, income levels average USD 1 345 per capita, whereas in Singapore, they are above USD 60 000 per capita. Growth in per capita income, at 3.8% p.a., is expected to outpace all other regions in the coming decade. It has been robust in the past, rebounding quickly from the COVID-19 related contraction in 2020. By 2022, average per capita income levels exceeded those of 2019 by more than 3%. In several countries endowed with energy or commodity reserves, the rebound benefitted from the higher commodity price cycle. Given historic growth, the share of primary agriculture, fish and forestry is anticipated to continue its longer-term decline from a share of about 13% in the base period, to around 9% by 2032. With strong economic growth, the average share of food in household expenditures in the region has fallen to below 17%. However, for the least developed countries this share is 30%6 and consequently the rise in food prices over the past two years impacted considerably on the food security of many in these countries. This is evident in the rise in moderate to severe food insecurity in both Southern and Southeast Asia – both regions that have made rapid progress in reducing hunger in the past. The region has increased its positive trade surplus with respect to agricultural goods, although resources are increasingly strained. It encompasses some 580 Mha of agricultural land, which amounts to just 0.2 ha/person, compared to the world average of around 0.6 ha/person. With population growth expected at 0.9% p.a., resource pressures will only intensify, which means productivity gains are of paramount importance. At 2% p.a., total factor productivity growth exceeded the global average of 1.4% p.a. in the last decade, which was a key factor that facilitated economic growth.7 Given existing pressure on its resource base, sustainability will need to be at the core of future productivity gains. Rising income and a growing, increasingly urbanised population imply strong demand growth for food products, but the evolution of consumer preferences remains somewhat uncertain, particularly with respect to animal sourced products. Urbanisation typically leads to rising consumption of higher value, more processed and convenience food products. However large parts of the region are either vegetarian (particularly in India), averse to pigmeat consumption, or lactose intolerant, suggesting that diets may evolve differently to many other parts of the world. At the same time, the heterogeneity across the region implies that demand preferences may evolve differently across it and in some countries, the demand for meat products is growing rapidly. 88  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The region has a fairly small positive trade balance but within it are several important importers and exporters of a range of agricultural and food products. It typically exports almost a quarter of agriculture and fish production. Exports are dominated by plant-based products, particularly rice and vegetable oil, where the region has an 81% and 61% share in global exports respectively. The Southeast Asia region is considered a major player in may global value chains, such as fisheries, cassava, or those involving vegetable oils and their further processed products.8 The main challenges facing the region relate to its ability to sustainably increase productivity and innovation, particularly in the face of resource limitations, climate change risks and its growing population. Despite historic progress, the region still accounts for about one-third of the world’s undernourished population. To continue improving food security, it will need to sustain income growth in a less supportive global environment, amid high inflation and ongoing affordability challenges. Thus, key policy considerations include the nature and extent of market intervention schemes and how they affect global market interactions. 2.2.2. Production Sustainable productivity gains are paramount to offset resource constraints The South and Southeast Asian region is the largest contributor to the total value of global output from agriculture and fisheries. Crop production accounts for the biggest share, at 52%, but livestock production is growing faster. By 2032, agricultural output from the region is expected to expand by 20%, among the fastest of all regions and over the projection period, it will account for the biggest share of global output growth. The rate of agricultural production growth is almost double that of its population, suggesting that the value of agricultural output is also set to rise in per capita terms. Crop production is expected to expand by 16%, resulting in a slight reduction in its share of total agriculture and fisheries output by 2032. This growth is achieved despite a mere 3.5% increase in land used for crop production over the ten-year period. In fact, growth in value generated per hectare of cropland accelerates over the projection period, to 1.2% p.a., reflecting a combination of intensification, crop mix changes and enhanced productivity. Increased fertiliser use will contribute to achieving yield gains, as application per hectare is expected to increase 8% by 2032. The response rates are such that the number of calories produced per unit fertiliser applied is also foreseen to rise. The region is a major contributor to global output for a variety of food products, including rice, wheat, vegetable oil, pulses, and sugar. Apart from vegetable oil, where it remains stable, the regions share in global production is expected to rise for all these products. Cereal production in the region is concentrated in India, Indonesia, Pakistan and LDC’s such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar. India alone accounts for around 70% and 40% of the region’s wheat and rice production respectively. Growth in cereal production is also concentrated in India, which accounts for three quarters of additional wheat and 46% of additional rice production over the coming decade. Growth in rice production is exclusively yield based, with a 15% increase in India and a 14% increase in Least Developed Asia by 2032, on an almost unchanged area. Sugar production is dominated by India and Thailand, which account for almost 60% and 17% of regional production respectively. Of the projected growth of 17% in regional sugar production, just over half is expected to come from Thailand, where varietal improvements and improved extraction rates are expected to drive growth, with a mere 3% expansion in area. The region accounts for 44% of vegetable oil produced globally, owing primarily to palm oil output in Malaysia and Indonesia. This sector has faced numerous disruptions in recent years, including adverse weather conditions, severe labour shortages due to restrictions in mobility of foreign workers through the pandemic and a temporary ban on exports from Indonesia to safeguard domestic supply. These are  89 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 additional to pre-existing structural constraints, such as aging oil palm plantations and increasing focus on sustainability concerns. Limited expansion of the mature oil palm area underpins a significant slowdown in palm oil production growth in the coming decade, particularly in Indonesia. Most of the additional production is expected to come from yield gains, due to increased mechanisation and renewal of old plantations. Livestock products currently account for 28% of the value of agriculture and fish output and growth of 2.6% p.a. will lead to an expansion of this share to 31% by 2032. India and Pakistan are the biggest contributors to this growth, which emanates mainly from dairy products. Milk production growth of 33% stems from a 23% expansion in cow numbers and an 8% improvement in milk yield per cow. Half of the expansion in the region’s cow inventory is attributed to India. Poultry accounts for just over half of total meat production and for nearly 60% of additional meat production by 2032. Growth in this sector is largely a result of increased feed intensity and breeding improvements. Pigmeat production in the region is limited and concentrated mainly in Viet Nam and Thailand. Following sharp reductions in 2019 and 2020 because of African Swine Fever (ASF), pigmeat production in Viet Nam has rebounded strongly and by 2022, exceeded 2018 levels. In the medium term, it is expected to expand by an annual average of 1.8%, to exceed 4.7 Mt by 2032. Bovine meat production is expected to rise by 1.6% p.a., with India and Pakistan contributing more than 60% of total production. Fish production is an important contributor to agricultural output in the region at 20% of total value. However, growth of 15% by 2032 is the slowest amongst the three subsectors, reducing its contribution over time. Whilst growth in captured fisheries is limited, reflecting resource limitations, growth of 2.3% p.a. in aquaculture implies that it will surpass captured fisheries by 2025, accounting for 54% of production by 2032. Total direct GHG emissions from agriculture are set to rise by 11% by 2032 relative to 2020-22, driven predominantly by the livestock sector. While crop related emissions will rise by 4%, livestock related emissions, which reflect ruminant herd expansion, will increase at a rate marginally slower than the past decade at 1.2% p.a. By 2032, 29% of agriculture related GHG emissions globally will be attributable to the region. 2.2.3. Consumption Strong demand growth but with distinct regional preferences After years of progress in reducing food insecurity and undernourishment, these trends in the South and Southeast Asian region have reversed, reflecting reduced income due to the pandemic in 2020, as well as subsequent rising food prices. These factors combined to impact significantly on food affordability and, particularly in East Asia, the prevalence of undernourishment rose above 15% for the first time in a decade. In both Southern and Southeast Asia, the prevalence of undernourishment rose further in 2021, despite the strong rebound in economic growth. Notwithstanding expectations of further income growth, the persistence of high food prices continues to constrain large scale improvements in food security in the short term and, having increased by less than 0.5% in 2022, improvements in calorie availability is again expected to be small in 2023. In the medium term, as food prices start to normalise, the combination of accelerated income growth, modest declines in population growth rates and consistent, albeit slow urbanisation, will support the continued evolution of dietary patterns, driving demand for calorie and nutrient dense foods (Law, Fraser and Piracha, 2020[2]; Kelly, 2016[3]; Reardon et al., 2014[4]). The type of products consumed are, however, also dictated by the region’s somewhat unique preferences, with a significant share of the population being vegetarian. By 2032, average calorie availability for consumption is projected to increase by 265 kcal/person/day to approach 2900 kcal, just 5% below the world average, predominantly derived from growth in consumption of wheat, pulses, rice, dairy products, and vegetable oils. 90  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Cereals still account for more than half of the calories available for consumption in the region. By 2032, the share of cereals in total calories consumed is expected to decline to 51%. Rice still accounts for the biggest share of total cereal consumption, but wheat consumption is also rising. At regional level, per capita consumption of rice and wheat products are expected to rise by 0.4% and 0.7% p.a. towards 2032, but trends diverge across countries. In India, rice and wheat consumption are expected to rise at a similar rate. Conversely, in Indonesia and Vietnam, rice consumption per capita is expected to decline, replaced by a concomitant rise in wheat products. Average protein intake remains well below the global level, but with gains of 9g/person/day by 2032, the deficit is expected to be close to 14%. This is underpinned by growing consumption of dairy and meat products. Dairy product consumption is already well above the world level and growth of 20% in per capita terms by 2032 will see it rise to almost 25% above the average level of consumption globally. The bulk of growth is attributed to fresh dairy products, which are expected to grow considerably in both India and Pakistan. Meat consumption is also expected to grow, but from a low base to reach just 12 kg per capita by 2032, but this regional average masks significant differences within it. In India, meat consumption is very limited and only expected to reach 3.3 kg per capita per year, whereas in Viet Nam, it is expected to rise by 7 kg per capita, to reach 52 kg by 2032. At the regional level, more than half of the growth in meat consumption is attributed to poultry, but in Viet Nam, it’s mainly driven by pigmeat. As livestock and dairy production grow, the combination of herd expansion, rising feed use intensity and efficiency gains will support growth of 21% in feed use by 2032. This expansion is slower than that of meat and dairy production, reflecting the impact of improved feed conversion ratios across the region. In Viet Nam, growth in feed use is much faster, at 34%, due to increasing feed use intensity in its pigmeat sector. Maize and protein meal constitute the bulk of animal feed in the region. The use of maize and protein meal in animal feed is expected to expand by 27% and 23% respectively by 2032, implying that the share of maize in total feed use will continue to rise. The region is foreseen to increase its share of global ethanol use to 12% by 2032, from less than 8% in 2020-22. This represents a significant gain in its global market share, which rests largely on increasing mandates, particularly in India, which now aims to achieve its ambitious E20 blending target by 2025. However, given limitations in feedstock supply, it is assumed to only reach this level by 2032. In Thailand, which has also developed blending targets as part of its Alternative Energy Development Plan, blending rates are expected to reach 14% by 2032. Ethanol production will add to the demand for agricultural products in these countries, particularly sugarcane, which is a major feedstock. The region currently contributes a larger share of 22% in global biodiesel use, and this is expected to grow to 24% by 2032, mainly due to increases in Indonesia where implementation of a 30% biodiesel blend aims to reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels. Combined with support measures under its biodiesel programme, this is expected to direct domestic palm oil supplies to the biodiesel market, underpinning growth of 33% in its biodiesel use by 2032. The additional stability that the biodiesel sector provides to palm oil prices could help to encourage investment into the sector, resulting in increased renewal of oil palm plantations. 2.2.4. Trade Export surplus sustained by India The South and Southeast Asia region is a small net exporter of agricultural commodities, but this surplus is expected to decline and become a small deficit by 2032. The region’s aggregate position masks significant differences within it. India is by far the biggest net exporter, and historically drove increasing surpluses, but over the outlook is also the primary driver of the decline in exports. Southeast Asia is also a net exporter, but its surplus is small and remains fairly consistent by 2032. By contrast, net imports from  91 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 the LDC’s and other developing countries of the region continue to rise. With the reduction in India’s surplus, the region reaches a net importing position by 2029. Total net exports from the region are expected to contract by 6.7% over the next ten years. Export products comprise mainly rice, roots and tubers, sugar, vegetable oil, and meat. Vegetable oil exports mainly accrue to Indonesia and Malaysia, the biggest palm oil exporters in the world. Growth in vegetable oil exports is limited, at just 0.3% p.a., resulting in a slight reduction in the region’s share of global exports. Conversely, rapid export growth for rice and sugar implies that the region will increase its global market share to 86% and 28% respectively. Almost a third of the growth in rice exports are expected to come from Thailand, whose exports could rise by an average of 1.9% p.a., with further significant contributions also coming from Viet Nam and LDC’s such as Myanmar and Cambodia. While the region is responsible for almost a quarter of global fish exports, this share is expected to decline, due to limited growth in fish exports amid rising domestic consumption. A significant share of fish trade will occur within the region. The region is increasingly dependent on imports for several commodities, including wheat, maize, soybeans, protein meal. Import dependence for these commodities is expected to rise over the next ten years. While the region is expected to account for a growing share of global meat and dairy product imports, these comprise a small share of total consumption and self-sufficiency rates remain fairly stable by 2032. In several individual countries, the role of imports are more pronounced. Figure 2.5.

Regional outlook: Sub Saharan Africa 2.3.1. Background Food security for a growing population remains a big challenge Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a vast and diverse region that comprises 19% of the world’s agricultural land and home to 1.1 billion people, 14% of the global population. Amongst the regions covered in this chapter, SSA has a distinct and striking demographic profile. Its population is the youngest, its rate of population growth is the fastest and its urbanisation rate is the slowest. By 2032, SSA’s 1.45 billion inhabitants are expected to account for 17% of the world’s population. While urbanisation is occurring, it is one of only two regions (the other being Near East and North Africa) where the absolute size of the rural population is still increasing and the only region where more than half of the total population is still expected to reside in rural areas by 2032. Average per capita income levels in the region are the lowest globally, at USD 1 706 in constant 2010 terms. However, levels vary considerably within the region, with incomes of less than USD 1 000 per capita in the Least Developed Countries, to USD 7 810 in South Africa. Economies typically depend strongly on resource based commodities, such as agriculture, oils and mining, with agriculture (including fisheries and forestry) accounting for 15% of economic output between 2020 and 2022. In some countries, this share is much higher. Despite high commodity prices, per capita GDP growth in the region only recovered by 1.9% in 2021, following the 5% contraction in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Further recovery momentum has been constrained by the global slowdown, tighter financial conditions across the world, limited funds to support recovery and surging inflation. Amid rising uncertainty in the global economy, exchange rates in many of the developing countries in the region depreciated sharply, accelerating inflation and in some instances leading to concerns over foreign currency reserves. In per capita terms, income growth amounted to less than 1% in 2022 and is expected to be similar in 2023, before averaging 1.2% over the remainder of the projection period. This will enable average income levels per capita to reach USD 1 930 by 2032, but current projected growth rates imply that the region will only surpass pre-pandemic income levels by 2025. Consistent with low absolute income levels, households in SSA spend a bigger share of total income on food than any other region covered in this chapter. On average, across SSA, this share is 23%, but it varies amongst countries, with the LDCs in the region spending on average 31%.9 Per capita calorie intake is already amongst the lowest in the world and the large share of total income spent on food heightens the region’s vulnerability to the persistently high food prices evident over the past two years. Amid a myriad of external shocks, such as the pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine, food affordability, and consequently food security, has become increasingly strained. The FAO’s State of Food Security and Nutrition (2022) notes that the recovery in GDP growth in 2021 did not translate to improvements in food security, as the prevalence of undernourishment rose further to 23.2%, having already increased from 20.1% in 2019 to 22.7% through the pandemic in 2020. The absolute number of undernourished people in the region increased by 12 million in 2021, which was less than half the 34 million additional 96  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 undernourished in 2020. While the prevalence of undernourishment in the region has been rising since 2018, the pandemic in 2020 induced a sharp acceleration that is proving difficult to turn around in the current environment. The combination of surging inflation, weaker economic growth, and high prices in 2022 will likely have led to further deterioration, with relief only likely when prices start to normalise. Sub-Saharan Africa is an agro-ecologically diverse, land abundant region that accounts for 16% of global crop land and 20% of pasture. Despite the region’s land abundance, significant differences exist among countries in terms of land availability and farm structures. In some regions, there is clear evidence that more medium scale farmers are emerging (Jayne et al., 2016[5]), whereas in others, the agricultural sector is facing pressures from land shortages and declining plot sizes. Large parts of available arable land are concentrated in few countries and is often under forest cover (Chamberlin, Jayne and Headey, 2014[6])), whereas in others it sits in remote areas poorly connected to markets and infrastructure. Despite its high share of land use globally, production practices are often less intensive in nature and the SSA region produced only 5% of the global value of agricultural and fish production in 2020-22. The regions share in global consumption is significantly higher, underpinned by its large population. Dietary composition is still highly staple-dependant and from 2020-22 SSA accounted for 42% of global roots and tuber consumption and 12% of cereals, compared to only 7% of sugar consumption and 6% of global vegetable oil consumption. Protein intake is comparatively low, reflecting weaker purchasing power, with only 6% of global fish consumption, 5% of dairy product consumption and 4% of meat consumption attributed to the region. Despite significant variation across countries, self-sufficiency rates for SSA overall are decreasing for most major food commodities, as domestic supply growth has failed to keep up with the rate of population expansion. Amongst the greatest challenges facing the region in the near and medium term will be reducing hunger and improving food security in a persistently low-income environment, amid increasingly volatile weather conditions resulting from climate change. Despite improvements and success stories in selected countries, productivity in most of the region remains stubbornly low. Concentration of land abundance in a few countries implies that substantial opportunities may arise to expand intra-regional trade, particularly considering tariff reductions contained in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, but trade-related costs need to be reduced to improve competitiveness. Over the outlook period, imports into the region are therefore expected to rise further. In an increasingly volatile and fragmented global market, the region’s greatest opportunity to supply more affordable food to its growing population and improve food security rests in closing the productivity gap, improving market access, and reducing the costs of transportation and regional trade. 2.3.2. Production Raising productivity is critical Over the coming decade, agriculture and fish production in the region is projected to expand by 24% in net value-added terms. This average annual gain of 2.2% remains slower than the expected population growth in the region and hence, the value of production per capita is set to decline further, in line with the trend observed since 2015 (Figure 2.5). The bulk of growth in total value is expected to come from crop production, which will account for more than 70% of total agricultural value by 2032, a slight increase from the base period. While the rate of growth in livestock production is marginally higher than crops, it occurs from a smaller base and its share in total value added is expected to rise only modestly from 19.5% in 2020-22 to 19.8% in 2032. The contribution from fish production to total value is set to decline to 10%. Cereals, roots, and tubers constitute the bulk of crop production in the region and, for many crop types, SSA’s share in global production is set to rise. By 2032, the SSA region is expected to contribute 42% of global production of roots and tubers, 22% of pulses, 6.5% of cereals, 2% of oilseeds and 6% of cotton. LDC’s account for around 65% of the region’s cotton production, mostly situated in West Africa where Benin and Burkina Faso are major contributors. Cotton production from Sub Saharan Africa’s LDC’s is  97 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 expected to grow by only 1.5% per annum on average, mostly due to yield gains as a small decline is projected in the area planted to cotton. Growth of 27% in food crop production over the coming decade will be underpinned by a combination of intensification, productivity gains and changes to the crop mix. The real value of crop production, expressed per unit of cropland used, is expected to rise by 1.7% p.a., accelerating from the past decade. This reflects some intensification, combined with a 7% expansion in land used for crop production by 2032. Double cropping is prevalent in many of the tropical regions with bimodal rainfall, as well as irrigated regions in Southern Africa, where soybeans and wheat are often produced consecutively in a single year. The expansion of rice cultivation, notably in Nigeria, is also expected to benefit from rising prevalence of multiple annual harvests. Further to the intensification, area expansion is also expected in several crops, with increases in roots and tubers, maize, rice, pulses, and other coarse grains only partly offset by reductions in wheat and cotton. The relatively small expansion in total land use of 0.2% p.a. over the outlook period represents a significant slowdown, at merely half the rate observed over the past decade. The region is mostly considered land abundant, but Chamberlain et al. already noted in 2014 that almost 65% of the available land for expansion is concentrated in only ten countries (Sudan, Madagascar, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Angola, Congo Republic, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, and Zambia). Elsewhere, the ongoing expansion of agricultural land use is constrained by land fragmentation, land degradation challenges, conflict in some land abundant countries, and the presence of other competing uses such as mining and urban sprawl. This accentuates the importance of achieving productivity gains to expand production in the region. Average cereal yields are projected to grow by 1.9% p.a. over the outlook period, marginally faster than the past decade. Continued yield gains for most major crops stem from investments in locally adapted, improved crop varieties, and better management practices. While yield growth for most crops exceeds the rates projected at a global level, this occurs from a base which is often less than half the global average. Consequently, although the region’s substantial gap relative to yields achieved in the rest of the world will narrow it will remain substantial by 2032. Efforts to fully close the yield gap are constrained by the limited use of inputs, irrigation, and infrastructure. Despite widespread implementation of fertiliser subsidy programs in many countries, fertiliser use is the lowest of all regions and, as a net importer of fertilisers, sharp cost increases in 2022 dampened purchases further. In many instances, this resulted in later, suboptimal application. Over the outlook period, fertiliser use is projected to increase by 9%, but application per hectare is still expected to be less than 20% of the global average (Figure 2.6). This increase is faster in LDC’s, where base period application rates are lower, but closure of the gap in fertiliser use remains constrained by affordability, partly due to the high cost of imported fertiliser in the region. The net value of livestock production is expected expand by 27% over the coming decade, marginally faster than crops. Much of this growth is led by the dairy sector, with the region expected to add 10 Mt of milk and almost 3 Mt of meat by 2032. Bovine meat is currently the largest among the different meat sectors in SSA and along with poultry is expected to account the biggest share of additional meat production, with 1 Mt of bovine meat and 916 Kt of poultry added by 2032. This is further supplemented by 622 Kt of ovine meat and almost 400 Kt of pigmeat. Most meat production growth is expected to occur in the region’s LDC’s (Figure 2.12). Bovine and ovine production systems in the region are typically extensive and growth in the coming decade is fuelled by herd expansion more than productivity gains. In 2020-22, the region accounted for only 7% of global bovine meat output yet almost 17% of the global bovine herd. The region’s share in the global bovine herd has increased steadily over the past decade and is projected to expand to almost 19% by 2032, yet its share in global beef production will remain just below 8%. Similarly, the region constitutes 13% of global ovine meat output, with 25% of the global ovine flock. Ovine meat production is expected to increase by 29% in the coming decade, with the region increasing its global share to 15%, but will graze 29% of the 98  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 global flock. The extensive nature of production systems also implies that a substantial share of production is reliant on natural grazing, which is influenced by weather conditions. Consequently, extreme weather conditions such as the prolonged drought in the Horn of Africa has resulted in large scale losses due to limited availability of grazing. Such pressures could increase in the coming decade, as the projected herd expansion will occur on an area of almost unchanged pastureland and climate change could have severe impacts on the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. While extensive poultry production systems, reliant on indigenous, dual-purpose breeds are still common in the region, a greater degree of intensification is also emerging, particularly in countries that produce surplus feed grains, such as South Africa. Albeit from a small base, feed intensity is expected to continue increasing in the region as supply chains modernise in countries such as Zambia, Tanzania, and Nigeria, but many smaller producers still continue to use non-grain, often informally procured feed inputs. In countries that already use feed more intensively, genetic improvements and better feed conversion over time will reduce the amount of feed required per animal. Overall, in the region, the net effect results in feed use growing at a marginally slower rate than poultry production, but this difference is bigger in Ethiopia and other LDC where intensification is still slower. Fish production in the SSA region is still mostly based on captured fisheries, which constituted more than 90% of total fish production in the 2020-22 base period. Aquaculture is growing and is expected to expand by almost 20% by 2032, but from a small base and is still expected to account for just under 10% of total fish production by 2032, compared with 8.7% in the base period. Growth in captured fisheries is slower, at 11% for the ten-year period to 2032, reflecting the finite nature of fisheries resources. These projections imply that the region’s direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture are expected to rise by 19% in 2032 compared to the base period. This is largely underpinned by further growth in extensive livestock, often in semi-arid areas where crop production is not viable and, by 2032, Sub\u0002Saharan Africa will account for 16% of the total direct agriculture emissions globally. However, agricultural emissions per USD value of production in the region are expected to continue a declining trend. 2.3.3. Consumption Dietary diversification remains sluggish The region is home to the highest concentration of poor and undernourished people in the world. Total calorie availability per capita is the lowest amongst the regions covered in this chapter. Pre-existing food security challenges in SSA were exacerbated in recent years by the prolonged effects of COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed to contain it, along with the ongoing war in Ukraine, surging inflation, and slow economic recovery. The initial shock from the pandemic was twofold, through supply chain disruptions, particularly in informal markets that abound in the region, as well as income and employment shocks which inhibited affordability of foods. While economies have opened post COVID-19, the effects of the war in Ukraine prolonged many of the supply chain challenges, particularly for commodities such as wheat, which are mostly imported into the region. The combination of persistently high food prices, slower economic growth in the short term and surging inflation will only perpetuate affordability constraints. Consequently, food security and undernourishment will likely remain challenges and even as income levels start to rise, a sustained recovery will require improvements in the availability, accessibility, affordability, and utilisation of food supplies in the future. The combination of economic contraction in 2020 and high prices since has led to reduced calorie availability per capita in the region for successive years. Stubbornly high inflation and the slow projected recovery in income levels further implies that per capita gains in calorie availability will be slow, suggesting that population growth will remain the major driver of rising food consumption in the region. In fact, the rate of population growth is such that, despite a mere 5% gain in total calorie availability per capita by 2032, SSA will still be one of the largest sources of additional food demand. Consequently, the region’s share of  99 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 total food calorie consumption in the world is expected to rise from 12% in the 2020-22 base period to 14% by 2032. Increases of 124 kcal/day over the outlook period will enable average calorie availability in the region to exceed 2555 kcal/capita per day by 2032. Adjusting for estimated household food waste, however, reduces the total intake to 2450 kcal/capita per day. Regardless of adjustments for household waste, total calorie availability in the region is 17% below the global average and still anticipated to be the lowest in the world by 2032. In terms of composition, the contribution of staples to total calorie availability is higher in SSA than any other region, at almost 70% in 2020-22 (Figure 2.13). Amongst these, maize, roots, and tubers account for the greatest share in total food staples consumption. Per capita consumption of food staples is set to rise further over the outlook period, but the composition is expected to change, with relative stability in roots and tubers contrasted by rising intake of rice and maize. The share of staples in total calorie availability is also expected to decline marginally. For most other commodity groups, including meat, dairy, fish, sugar and vegetable oils, per capita consumption levels are currently the lowest globally. While per capita consumption of meat, dairy, sugar, and vegetable oil is set to rise modestly over the outlook period, a small decline is projected in per capita consumption of fish. Changes in per capita consumption levels suggest that dietary diversification remains slow, but given rapid population growth, total food consumption will rise considerably for all commodities. Protein availability is expected to increase by 2.6 g per person per day, primarily from plant-based sources (Figure 2.13). Meat and dairy consumption gains are minimal, while fish is expected to decline, limiting improvements in vital nutrient and micronutrient intake. Cereals are set to overtake roots and tubers over the coming decade as the main source of feed to the livestock sector – with maize the major contributor. However, the extensive nature of production systems that predominate across most of the region dictate that total feed use is low. By 2032, it will account for just over 4% of total animal feed consumed in the world, despite being home to 17% of the world’s population. 2.3.4. Trade Import dependence grows with slow progress in regional trade agreements To supply its rapidly expanding population, the region is expected to rely progressively on imports to supplement regional production. With few exceptions, most basic food commodities in the region are produced for domestic consumption rather than exports, but domestic production of many products is insufficient to meet demand. Nevertheless, many countries also benefit from counter seasonality in the northern hemisphere and competitive labour costs, enabling net exports of high value fresh produce. The region’s trade deficit in major food items is anticipated to deepen over the coming decade, as the need for imports grows faster than the supply of exports. In constant (2014-16) global reference prices, the deficit is projected to accelerate compared to the past decade, from about USD 9 billion in 2020-22 to USD 24 billion by 2032. Persistent food deficits are expected to be amplified by an increasing food import bill due to global inflation, national debt denominated in US dollars and rising US interest rates, particularly for African countries that are over-exposed to the US dollar. While largely self-sufficient in maize production, the region is highly reliant on imports of major cereals such as rice and wheat. Amid rising import volumes, self-sufficiency ratios for both these commodities are set to decline to 50% and 24% respectively by 2032. With a large share of wheat imports typically procured from both Russia and Ukraine, imports into the region were severely disrupted at the start of the war in 2022. The cost of imported products also rose sharply over the past year, but initial availability constraints 100  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 eased following the UN brokered grain deal. Amid ongoing war in Ukraine, and the debilitating, multi-year drought in East Africa, the renewal of this deal in 2023 is critical to the region. While most trade related problems directly associated with the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic have eased, the region already scored poorly in trade efficiency indicators such as the World Bank’s logistics performance index prior to the disruptions that characterised the past three years. Import volumes of most commodities have increased following the challenges of 2020, but the region continues to be bedevilled by high freight rates and persistently high fuel costs, which have exacerbated pre-existing high trade costs, increasing prices for consumers, bearing heavily on those with low incomes. In contrast to basic food crops, the region is a net exporter of higher value products such as cotton, as well as fresh fruit and vegetables. The bulk of cotton is sold in the global market and by 2032, more than 85% of domestic cotton production will be exported. The real value of fruit and vegetable exports are expected to grow by 28% and 44% respectively by 2032. Consequently, the total value of agricultural exports from the region, expressed in 2014-16 USD, are expected to grow by almost 19% over the coming decade. The SSA region has placed much hope for expanded intra-regional trade on the successful implementation of the AfCFTA. Regionalisation of agricultural value chains for prioritised commodities are part of the African Union strategy to drive agrifood system transformation, increased productivity and agro-processing growth by linking producers and agro-parks in surplus areas to markets and areas of need. The agreement is in its second year of operation and its goal of growing internal trade across the region is critical for economic development, particularly amid rising global uncertainties. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed initial implementation and in 2020 intra-Africa trade declined to 16%, compared to a five-year average of 18%. Agricultural products constitute about a quarter of intra-Africa trade and supply chain disruptions because of the pandemic clearly had an impact, but expectations are high and renewed political momentum has provided the agreement with much needed impetus. The ambition of the AfCFTA is to achieve a zero-tariff rate on 90% of tariff lines, through a phased approach over a period of ten years for LDC’s and five years for others. So far, eight countries are already participating in the Guided Trade Initiative, which seeks to allow commercially meaningful trade under the agreement, to test operational, institutional, legal and trade policy. The products earmarked for trade under this initiative include several agricultural and food products. Despite progress made, many rules of origin agreements remain outstanding, and some customs union members are yet to ratify the agreement, which prevents several regional trade unions from fully trading under preferential terms, unless concessions can be made to allow the agreement to be implemented on an individual basis. While further engagements regarding rules of origin need to be concluded, the agreement will ultimately only exclude 3% of tariff lines and therefore has significant potential to increase intra-Africa trade in the medium term. The UNCTAD, in its 2021 Economic Development Report on Africa notes that the projected USD 3 trillion borderless market could be instrumental in reversing current trends in poverty, inequality and growth on the continent. Apart from tariffs, a major factor constraining trade within the region is high non-tariff barriers. Although the agreement includes a mutual recognition of standards and licences, as well as the harmonisation of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, many non-tariff barriers are more difficult to remove or reduce. The non-tariff costs of trade in the continent, as per the ESCAP-World Bank trade cost data, are estimated at an ad valorem equivalent of around 283%. Moreover, these are over 300% for agricultural products10 and more than 100% higher compared to non-agricultural manufacturing products. A major contributor in this regard is the high cost of road transportation, which emanates from poor infrastructure, as well as inefficiencies at border posts. This is supported by the presence of only six SSA countries in the top half of the World Bank’s logistical performance index ranking, which covers 160 countries. Based on the regulations implemented to date, and the need to finalise tariff reduction schedules and sensitive product lists, no discernible impact was included in the Outlook’s baseline projection.  101 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 2.9.

Regional outlook: Near East and North Africa 2.4.1. Background Rising import dependence due to fundamental supply constraints The Near East and North Africa11 region encompasses a range of countries with diverse income and socioeconomic profiles. Many face similar challenges with respect to the agricultural production environment and a fragile natural resource base. In the region, less than 5% of total land is considered arable and water resources are constrained, so most countries face water scarcity. In several countries, this is extreme. In 2020, 19 of 22 Arab states fell below the threshold for renewable water scarcity of 1 000 m3 per capita per year, with 13 states situated below the absolute water scarcity threshold of 500 m3 per capita per year (UN WWDR, 2022[7]). The region is also amongst the most vulnerable to climate change, due to its arid nature and already limited water resources. Across the spectrum of least developed, middle- and high-income economies, the region includes many oil exporting nations in the Gulf, whose economies are intrinsically tied to energy markets. The contribution of oil to revenue implies that it can have significant impacts on demand prospects. In this regard, energy market volatility in recent years impacted significantly on income levels. The region’s economy was amongst the worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and per capita income contracted by over 7% in 2020, before rebounding only modestly with gains of less than 2% in 2021. In 2022, support from high oil prices provided new impetus, and growth accelerated to 3.3%. The region’s inherent sensitivity to energy market developments implies that it will likely continue to face significant volatility in the short term, as Russia’s war against Ukraine continues, but energy prices are expected to remain below 2022 levels by 2032. Medium term prospects will also be influenced by the increasingly challenging global environment and per capita income growth is expected to average 1.7% p.a. over the coming decade. Consequently, it is unlikely to constitute a major driver of demand, which is a concern in a region where healthy diets are unaffordable to more than half of the population (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2022[8]). Population growth is another important factor determining demand and growth is expected to slow only marginally from 22% over the past decade to 20% over the next ten years. This growth rate is second only to the SSA region and will see the region’s population exceed 510 million people by 2032. Approximately two thirds of the population is expected to reside in urban areas, which may encourage consumption of higher value products, including meat and dairy products, but also convenience products that often contain substantial quantities of vegetable oil and sugar. The region is amongst the largest net food importers in the world, largely due to the challenging production environment resulting from its natural resource limitations. Self-sufficiency rates are low for most commodities, but particularly for cereals, vegetable oils and sugar (Figure 2.15). High import dependency also implies that the trade related challenges of the past three years have been particularly impactful in the region. Logistical problems and surging shipping costs emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic and the fragilities it exposed in global trade systems were further exacerbated by Russia’s war against Ukraine. Traditionally, the region is highly reliant on both Russia and Ukraine for its wheat supplies. Initial disruptions 106  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 to trade have been eased somewhat by the grain deal which enabled exports from Ukraine to resume, but volumes are much lower than before, and the region has been forced to source significant quantities elsewhere. The increase in imported cereal prices, further exacerbated by currency depreciation in many non-oil exporting nations, combined with surging inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, strained affordability of basic foods in lower income areas and that of healthy diets across the region. With average food expenditures around 17% of total household expenditures, and least developed countries at 33%, income and price shocks can have a significant impact on welfare.12 In an effort to reduce import dependence in major cereals and thereby also the associated vulnerabilities to disruptions, policies have historically sought to stimulate production. While these policies strove to reduce risk, they in fact constrained growth, as these cereals compete with higher value crops for limited water resources. Consequently, the region’s already limited resource base was stretched and with rising cereal production, the availability of higher value fresh produce declined. Such produce might otherwise have aided in improving dietary diversity and provide higher income from the same limited resources. Climate change remains a major challenge and geopolitical conflict in the region has further reduced investment and displaced populations, hindering production growth. The GDP derived from the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector currently comprises only 5% of economic activity and it is expected to decline to 4% by 2032. Egypt produces 25% of the net value of agriculture and fish production in the region, with a further 51% attributed to the rest of North Africa (18% from LDC’s and 33% from other North African countries). These shares are expected to be sustained, such that North Africa will continue to constitute more than three quarters of net agricultural output value in the region by 2032. In a low-income growth environments, and with several countries affected by geopolitical conflict, some of the greatest challenges facing the region relate to accessibility of affordable food products to a growing population. Import dependence is inevitable given limitations to production and natural resource endowment, particularly in a region highly impacted by climate change, hence self-sufficiency rates for most major commodities are expected to decline further. Imports contribute significantly to dietary diversity and efficient trade facilitation can propel progress toward the 2030 goal of eradicating hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. However, in an increasingly volatile and fragmented global market, faced with a mounting number of severe trade related disruptions in recent years, adaptable and effective policies and procurement practices will be essential to ensure food security and improve resilience. In an effort to mitigate vulnerability, many countries are actively seeking to diversify import sources. 2.4.2. Production Productivity gains urgently needed to confront severe resource constraints The region’s dependence on global markets is expected to deepen (Figure 2.14), reflecting a projected expansion of 1.5% p.a. in agriculture and fish production, which is slower than the past decade and below the population growth rate of 1.6% p.a. Crop production from the commodities covered in the Outlook constitutes 40% of total value, but average growth of only 1% p.a. implies that this share could decline to 38% by 2032. Livestock production growth is stronger at 2.1% p.a., with its share in total net value increasing to 42% by 2032. Fish production is an important contributor, comprising 21% of agricultural value, but growth of just 0.9% p.a. is markedly slower than the past decade and will see its share decline marginally to 20% by 2032. Almost 70% of total production comes from capture in coastal areas, but fish stocks are under pressure, resulting in a significant slowdown over the outlook period. The aquaculture sector is growing in importance and expanded by more than 5% p.a. over the past decade, with Egypt the major contributor. Growth is projected to slow over the outlook period, but at 2.4% p.a. is still sufficient to drive aquaculture’s share in total production to 33% by 2032.  107 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Little change is expected in total agricultural land use, which expands by only 0.5% over the ten-year period. The expansion is concentrated in the least developed regions, mainly Sudan and Mauritania, and almost half of the additional land is for pasture. In most countries in the region, conditions are not conducive to large scale crop production, but more than half of total cropland is expected to be allocated to cereal production by 2032, reflecting a modest decline of 2% from current levels. Coarse grains and wheat account for the bulk of total cereal production and will account for 63% and 35% respectively of total land used for cereals by 2032. In a region facing such severe constraints in the availability of arable land and water, productivity gains are essential to drive growth. Total factor productivity grew by a modest 1.2% p.a. in the decade to 2019, driven largely by increased capital inputs.13 The value generated per hectare land used for crop production has increased consistently by 0.8% p.a. over the past decade and this is expected to accelerate over the next ten years to 1.2% p.a. This trend involves multiple factors. The first is intensification, as the 1.5 Mha expansion in total crop area harvested exceeds the 1.2 Mha gain in land used for crop production. The second is considerable improvements in yields for most major crops. Wheat yields are expected to improve by an annual average of almost 1%, to reach 3 tonnes per hectare by 2032, almost 80% of the global average. Coarse grain yields are expected to rise by 1.8% p.a., but only reach 44% of the global average. Most of the expected yield gains are underpinned by improvement in technology, with fertiliser use per hectare expected to decline marginally over the ten-year period to 2032. Meat production is expected to grow by almost 2.4 Mt by 2032, mostly derived from poultry. Poultry production already comprises 59% of total meat production and growth of 2.8% p.a. increases its share to 62% by 2032. Anticipated growth in bovine meat and sheepmeat production is slower at 1.9% p.a. and 1.5% p.a. respectively. In the case of ovine meat, this represents an acceleration from the past decade, whereas for bovine meat it represents a turnaround from an historic contraction. Growth in inventory is slower than that of production for both bovine and ovine species, reflecting expected productivity gains in meat production. Direct GHG emissions from livestock activities in the region will expand by 6.8% by 2032 compared to 2020-22, which sharply contrasts with the growth of 28.0% and 23.9% for meat and dairy production respectively. Such differences clearly illustrate that productivity gains are imperative to contain emissions. With crop emissions expected to decline by 3.2%, total direct emissions from agriculture are projected to expand 5.4% by 2032. The historic decline in GHG emissions per unit value of output is set to continue. 2.4.3. Consumption Affordability limits a shift to healthier, more diverse diets In an effort to promote food security, policies in the region have traditionally focussed on supporting the consumption of basic foodstuff through subsidies. In recent years, these have been expanded to include animal products. While they did initially improve food security, these policies have further entrenched the region’s staple-heavy diets. Furthermore, in recent years, both the prevalence of undernourishment and the number of undernourished people has started rising again. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these trends in 2020. In the current high price environment, the region has been unable to reverse them, with further deterioration of food security in 2021, despite a higher share of total income being spent on food products and the introduction of a range of policies to improve food security and increase resilience. Despite accelerated income growth in 2022, the combination of persistently high food prices and sustained general inflation further constrained affordability and total calorie availability declined. By 2032, total calorie availability is expected to increase only marginally to 3034 kcal/person/day, slightly lower than the global average. Accounting for household food waste estimates implies that total calorie intake could be around 2 830 kcal/person/day. Limited gains over the outlook period reflects a combination of factors. Firstly, the prolonged nature of the economic recovery, which sees income levels surpass pre- 108  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 pandemic levels by 2024. Secondly, the influence of high current prices, which results in reduced calorie availability in the short term. Thirdly, it also reflects an increasing awareness of healthy eating. There is however great diversity within the region and the relative contribution of these three factors in influencing the number of calories consumed will vary. In the LDC’s in the Middle East, calorie availability remains low and is only expected to reach 2 650 kcal/person/day, almost 15% below the global average (Figure 2.19). Within these lower income countries, the share of total expenditure spent on food is also higher, which magnifies the impact of the recent high price environment on food security. The projections for the average diet in the region suggest that 53% of calories will come from cereals by 2032, well above the global average of 43%. A similar picture emerges for sugar, where the region’s share of total calorie consumption derived from sugar will be 9% compared to a global average of 8%. The typical diet, which is highly dependent on starchy foods and sugar is calorie dense but nutrient poor and often associated with a rising incidence of over-weight and obesity, as well as chronic diseases such as diabetes. At the same time, the prevalence of undernourishment, as well as stunting and wasting in young children is high in some countries, particularly those of lower income or affected by conflict. This reflects diversity amongst countries, but also suggests that the “triple burden” of malnutrition (undernutrition, overweight and micronutrient deficiency) will be a key policy challenge that will need to be addressed over the medium term , with food quality central to a solution. However, affordability remains a major constraint to the adoption of healthier, higher quality diets. The average level of protein availability in the region is projected to reach 84 g/day in 2032, still less than in the base period. Most of the decline is attributed to reduced consumption of plant-based proteins, which is not fully offset by higher quality meat and fish protein sources. Per capita consumption of poultry, bovine meat and most dairy products is set to rise, but typically by less than 1% p.a. The growth of the livestock sector, particularly poultry, will increase feed use by 15% over the coming decade, but efficiency gains keep the rate of growth below that of meat production. Commodities such as maize, barley and protein meals, are expected to account for more than 70% of the total feed use. The bulk of feed materials will continue to be imported, with maize, for example, reaching 30 Mt by 2032 compared to 25 Mt in the base period. This trend reflects policies that prioritise the production of food crops over feed crops in an environment that has very limited production potential. 2.4.4. Trade Rising imports continue for most products The region is expected to become increasingly dependent on imports of food products over the coming decade, owing to the combination of strong population growth and severe limitations in production capacity. By 2032, the region’s net imports of food products are expected to be second only to the Developed and East Asia region, but on a per capita basis will be the largest. Within the region, food imports per person are highest in Saudi Arabia and the Other Middle East area which include the Gulf States (Figure 2.14). At the height of the logistical and economic challenges of the pandemic, the region’s total import bill, expressed in real terms, declined in 2020 relative to 2019. Following a modest increase in 2021, it rose by almost 5% in 2022, despite the problems with trade from the Black Sea region, reflecting the extent of economic recovery amid high oil prices. Imports are expected to rise further, but slower in 2023, constrained by persistently high food product prices and weaker income growth. By 2032, the region’s import bill is expected to increase by 30% relative to the base period. Imports are expected to rise for almost all commodities, though generally at a faster rate for meat and dairy than plant-based products. Imports by the region will sustain high and generally rising shares of global markets for many commodities by 2032, including wheat (26%), sugar (23%) and maize (15%). The region will also account for high shares in global trade for sheepmeat (34%), cheese (21%) and poultry (18%) by 2032. The region is a major importer globally, but as imports comprise a substantial share of domestic  109 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 consumption, significant developments in either global or domestic markets have broad food security implications in the Near East and North Africa.

Regional outlook: Europe and Central Asia 2.5.1. Background Increasing focus on sustainability amid ongoing risks from Russia’s war against Ukraine The Europe and Central Asian14 region includes a diverse range of countries that span two continents and exhibit various stages of development. Considerable difference exists across countries in terms of agricultural resources, demographics and public policies. It also faces a multitude of risks, most pertinently Russia’s war against Ukraine, which also contributes to persistently high food inflation, and the ever present risks associated with climatic fluctuations. The region accounts for 12% of world population, but with growth of less than 1% by 2032, this share is set to decline. Population dynamics differ significantly across the region. In Western Europe, home to 55% of the region’s inhabitants, it remains almost unchanged by 2032, whereas in Eastern Europe, it is expected to decline by 0.7%. By contrast, in Central Asia, it is anticipated to expand by 11%, but by 2032, Central Asia will still only account for 11% of the region’s people. The rate of urbanisation is high across the region and by 2032, 75% of its inhabitants are expected to reside in urban environments. In Central Asia, this share is lower than in Europe, and expected to reach 51% by 2032. Average income in the region is over USD 26 600 per capita per year. This encompasses a range from almost USD 39 000 per capita per year in Western Europe’s highly developed economies, to USD 12 700 per capita in the resource dependant eastern regions to merely USD 5020 per capita per year in central Asia. Having successfully navigated the economic challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic with a 5.7% rebound in per capita GDP in 2021, Russia’s war against Ukraine unleashed a humanitarian crisis in 2022. The persistence of the war is also taking a growing toll on Europe’s economies. The energy crisis had already hampered households’ purchasing power, and with Central Banks acting to control obstinately high inflation, financial conditions have tightened substantially. Growth in per capita GDP is expected at just 0.2% in 2023, before improving to 1.6% p.a. in the medium term. Much of the medium-term prospects will depend on the duration of the war, but its current protracted nature suggests that there are significant downside risks to growth, while inflationary risks remain. In line with different stages of development, the share of primary agriculture, forestry, and fish production in GDP ranges from less than 2% in the European Union, to 13% in Central Asia. Similarly, it is estimated that the share of food in household expenditures averaged about 11% in the region in 2020-2022, from around 6% for United Kingdom to around 17% in Türkiye and even higher in many Central Asian countries.15 Consequently, the impact of current high food prices, amid elevated general inflation, will differ across countries, with a generally greater impact in regions that spend a larger share of total income on food. This is evident in the sharp increase in the prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity in Central Asia, due to the pandemic in 2020 and again in 2021, despite the recovery in incomes. Particularly in Eastern Europe, this may increase further in 2022 and 2023 because of the ongoing war. 114  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Major agricultural producers in the region include the European Union, United Kingdom, Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye, and Kazakhstan. It currently accounts for 12% of the global value of agriculture and fish production, a share which is set to decline to 11% by 2032, largely due to stagnation in Western Europe, with output set to expand by 1.2% p.a. and 1.8% p.a. respectively in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. This mirrors historic disparities in factor productivity within the region: in western Europe TFP growth was just 6% in the decade up to 2019, while it was almost 50% in eastern Europe, marked by a large increase in the productivity of labour, but starting from a low base. The region’s agricultural sector overcame a multitude of challenges through the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes to demand, both in terms of quantity and composition, logistical bottlenecks, and workforce shortages , influenced by labour mobility challenges. Over the past year, it has dealt with a new layer of complexity due to the ongoing war. Historically, Russia was a major supplier of agricultural inputs to the rest of Europe and Central Asia, and to many other countries outside the region. After a sharp initial increase, input prices have started to soften and trade patterns have changed. Both Russia and Ukraine are also significant contributors to agricultural exports. The protracted nature of the war limits Ukraine’s ability to engage in agricultural activities and destruction to infrastructure has reduced its productive capacity. By December 2022, after eight months of active war, the (FAO, 2022[9]) estimated that damages to the agricultural sector, emanating from destruction of machinery and equipment, storage facilities, livestock, and perennial crops, as well as stolen inputs and output, already exceed USD 2.2 billion. With export volumes severely reduced, despite the enabling role of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, many countries have needed to find alternative sources of imports. The Europe and Central Asia region’s export growth has been striking in the past. Over the past decade, the region accounted for almost 13% of the total growth in the global net value of agriculture and fish, but it constituted 38% of growth in global exports. This reflects improved productivity in both crop and livestock production, along with limited population growth and a relatively mature consumption base in the region. Eastern Europe’s expansion was a major contributor to its growing export orientation, with central contributions from both Russia and Ukraine. Consequently, this trend is expected to moderate, particularly in the short term, due to the impacts of the war on Ukraine’s production and subsequent ability to export. Many uncertainties remain with respect to possible resolutions to the conflict, and the time required to rebuild damaged infrastructure and fully restore productive capacity. Sanctions imposed on Russia will also influence trade. Although these sanctions do not directly affect trade in agriculture and food products, indirect effects are possible due to logistical challenges and financial constraints. A substantial share of trade occurs within the region, which implies that the evolution of preferential trade agreements, such as future arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union, will also play a role. The European Union accounts for almost half of the value of the region’s agriculture and fish production. Its priority afforded to sustainability and improved resilience is reflected in its Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies. The Farm to Fork strategy envisions a fair, healthy, environmentally friendly, and sustainable food system. It may influence demand trends, trade flows, competitiveness, and production growth in the region. Other objectives contained in its reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), such as the reduction in energy dependency through increased renewable energy production, bolstered sector resilience and changing diets will also play a role. Russia’s war against Ukraine implies that, among the regions included in the Outlook, Europe and Central Asia face the most uncertainty. After more than a year of war, even when a resolution is found, the extensive destruction of infrastructure, loss of lives and displacement of labour will require considerable investments to restore productive capacity in the agro-food chain. The uncertainty with respect to production prospects from Eastern Europe comes at a time when policies in the European Union are increasingly focused on sustainability, which implies that the cost of increasing production will rise, particularly in the face of ongoing climate change impacts. Amid ongoing efforts to reduce energy dependence and bolster the resilience of the agricultural sector, achieving sustainable productivity gains will remain critical.  115 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 2.5.2. Production Growth slows amid ongoing war in Ukraine Compared to the 2020-22 base period, the net value of agriculture and fish production is only expected to grow 7% by 2032, less than half the rate observed in the past. This entails an expansion of 22% in Central Asia and 11% in Eastern Europe, whereas output from Western Europe rises by less than 2% in 2032 compared to current levels. While Ukraine is assumed to reach historic productive capacity by 2032, the recovery is slow. Output growth from Eastern Europe is expected to be led by Türkiye and Russia, at 26% and 9% respectively. Kazakhstan accounts for almost a third of the growth from Central Asia. In Russia, growth is underpinned by the crop sector, whereas in Türkiye and Kazakhstan, significant additional output is expected from both crops and livestock products. Growth is mainly derived from productivity gains, as the long-term decline in agricultural land-use is expected to persist. The contraction in land used for crop production, at 128 Kha, is a fraction of pastureland, at 1.9 Mha. These aggregate shifts in land use mask some regional differences. For instance, in Central Asia, a minimal expansion is expected in total agricultural land-use, but this is much more substantial in pasture than in cropland. In Eastern Europe, land used for crop production could expand marginally, but a significant decline is expected in pastureland. In Western Europe, a contraction is foreseen in both pasture and land used for crop production. In the total Europe and Central Asia region, 44% of the value generated by agriculture and fish production is attributed to the crop sector. An expansion of 0.9% p.a. is sufficient to push this share up marginally by 2032. This growth combines the effects of intensification, in both Western Europe and Central Asia, and yield improvements, underpinned by technological innovation. Yield gains are expected across all major crops, ranging from 0.7% p.a. for cereals to 0.9% p.a. for pulses. As fertiliser prices normalise, a 7% increase in fertiliser application per hectare of cropland is expected to contribute to these gains. The bulk of crop production growth from the region is ascribed to cereals and oilseeds, mainly from Eastern Europe. Russia in particular is expected to sustain robust growth in maize (24%), wheat (14%), soybeans (32%) and other oilseeds (19%) over the coming decade. By 2032, Russia is expected to account for 44% of the region’s soybean production, as well as 28% of other oilseeds and 29% of wheat. Growth arises from a combination of yield gains and area expansion, with these four crops accounting for an additional 2.7 Mha by 2032 relative to 2020-22. At the same time, yield gains are expected to exceed 1% p.a. for wheat and maize, and only marginally below 1% for oilseeds. Beyond Russia, notable wheat production growth is also expected in Türkiye and Kazakhstan, at 19% and 29% respectively by 2032. In Ukraine, a major contributor to historic increases, the prolonged recovery from ongoing war limits future growth prospects. Livestock production accounts for 46% of total agriculture and fish output in the region. Production growth is expected to be slower than that of crops, at just 0.4% p.a. Western Europe still accounts for 63% of the region’s livestock, but a modest contraction over the coming decade, amid its ongoing transition to environmental sustainability, will see this share diminish to 59% by 2032. Stronger growth in Eastern Europe and Central Asia will enable these regions to expand their contribution to total livestock production in the region to 39% and 12% respectively. Poultry accounts for the bulk of additional meat produced by 2032 and while growth is robust across most of the region, the bulk of additional production emanates from Eastern Europe, as Türkiye accounts for almost 40% of additional output. Pigmeat production is expected to contract, mainly due to reduced output from Western Europe. Almost half of the region’s dairy products are produced in Western Europe, but this share is expected to decline by 2032 to 44%. This follows an anticipated reduction in output from Western Europe of 5%, combined with growth of 7% and 35% respectively in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which yields a net gain of 5% across the region. While cow inventories are rising in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, a contraction of 9% is foreseen in Western Europe, mainly from intensive systems. This reduction is shaped 116  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 by the European Union’s ongoing prioritisation of sustainability, which is expected to reduce its share in global production to less than 15% by 2032, down from 17% in the 2020-22 base period. Fish production constitutes 10% of total agricultural output and growth of 10.5% by 2032 is sufficient to sustain this share. Aquaculture’s share in total production is expected to reach 25% by 2032, thanks to growth of 1.6% p.a., compared to a mere 0.5% p.a. for captured fisheries. Direct agricultural GHG emissions are projected to remain almost unchanged at regional level, rising by only 0.6% by 2032. This encompasses a decline of 5% in Western Europe and 4% in the European Union, mainly from reductions in the livestock sectors. At the same time, emissions are expected to rise in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where livestock herds are still expanding. Amid ongoing productivity gains, GHG emissions expressed relative to the value of agricultural production are projected to decline by 6% compared to its level in the 2020-22 base period. The decline in emissions relative to output is highest in Western Europe at 7%. 2.5.3. Consumption Diverging trends in animal sourced foods with reductions in Western Europe and increases in Central Asia Despite the relative maturity of most of the region’s consumer base, the impact of disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s war against Ukraine and growing inflationary pressure, particularly for food, are widespread. Affordability concerns are greatest in regions with less comprehensive income support measures and a higher share of total income spent on food. Furthermore, in Eastern Europe, the ongoing war brought a whole new set of food security concerns and supply chain disruptions, with millions of people displaced, infrastructure and distribution channels damaged and significant price volatility. Beyond the war\u0002affected region, most of the disruptions associated with the pandemic have eased, but many of the consumer trends that accompanied it, such as shifts in procurement channels, increased local sourcing and a heightened focus on “healthy eating” are expected to persist, influencing demand preferences. The region’s average daily calorie availability per capita is well above the global average and is projected to increase by only 2%, or 54 kcal/day to exceed 3 430 kcal/day by 2032. However, this is not uniform across the region. In Western Europe, and particularly the European Union, total calorie availability is expected to decline, as heightened health consciousness and growing awareness of sustainability (particularly from an environmental perspective) amongst its mature consumer base lead to reduced consumption of vegetable oils and animal-based products. Conversely, calorie availability is expected to rise in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, by 163 kcal/day and 222 kcal/day respectively. These gains are spread across most food groups, with significant contributions from cereals, vegetable oils, meat, and dairy. Protein availability, expressed in per capita terms, was almost 23% above the global average in 2020-22. By 2032, it is only expected to increase by 4%, to reach 107g/day. While gains are expected across the region, they are smaller in Western Europe than elsewhere. More than half of the additional protein consumption is anticipated to come from plant-based sources, which are often perceived as healthy alternatives. Growth in meat and dairy product consumption is also notable, at 0.2% and 0.6% p.a. respectively, though it will be concentrated in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Meat consumption is expected to approach 50kg per capita by 2032, more than 67% above the global average. In the European Union, protein consumption is already high and consumers are increasingly aware of health and environmental considerations. Consequently, dairy product consumption is expected to decline by 5%, but it remains an important product group and by 2032 is still expected to contribute 13% of total calories and 21% of total protein. Per capita consumption of cheese and butter remain more than six times and double the global average level respectively. Similarly, meat products constitute 24% of total protein availability by 2032, despite the modest decline in total per capita consumption. Minor declines in pigmeat,  117 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 bovine and ovine meat consumption is expected to be partly negated by rising poultry intake, thereby increasing the share of poultry in total meat consumption to almost 30% by 2032. Overall, across the region, fish consumption is expected to rise by 5%, with faster growth expected in Central Asia, and the European Union. In Western Europe, consumption levels are already high, and by 2032 are expected to exceed the global average by almost 10%, or 2kg per capita. Conversely, growth in Central Asia, from a small base, is only sufficient for consumption to reach 22% of the global average level by 2032. The relative importance of animal products in terms of both consumption and production is also reflected in feed, where the region accounts for almost a quarter of global use. Growth prospects mirror those of livestock production, with a distinct slowdown in the coming decade. Total feed use is only expected to expand by 2.6% by 2032, with a 4% reduction in Western Europe offset by gains of 12% and 25% respectively in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Almost half of the additional feed used in Eastern Europe is attributed to Türkiye. The concentration of growth in Eastern Europe also underpins the faster rate of growth in maize feed use relative to wheat. The European Union’s drive to increase renewable energy production is enshrined in its new overall renewable energy target of 32% by 2030. Despite expected reductions in both gasoline and diesel use, ethanol use is expected to expand by almost 8% over the coming decade, while biodiesel use remains stable. Considering sustainability concerns around palm oil, which is classified as high risk under the new Renewable Energy Directive, its use for biodiesel production is expected to decline by almost 11%. 2.5.4. Trade Slow recovery in Ukraine exports depends on resolution of the war Trade in Europe and Central Asia has been amongst the most dynamic of the regions covered in this chapter. Historically a major net importer, this deficit has shrunk to merely a third of the level ten years ago. The primary driver of this shift was Eastern Europe, mainly Russia and Ukraine, where the exportable surplus in 2020-22 was bigger than the deficit a decade ago (Figure 2.19). In light of ongoing war in the region, this trend is also set to change, at least in the short term. Over the past decade, Ukraine accounted for almost 40% of the growth in net exports from Eastern Europe. While the grain deal, signed mid-2022 under the Black Sea Grain Initiative was a critical in enabling continued exports from Ukraine, volumes were significantly reduced and with production set to decline as a result of the war, exports are expected to contract further in the short term. The continued extension of the grain deal also remains uncertain. While a resolution to the ongoing war would enable both production and export growth to resume in the medium term, restoration of its productive and trade capacity would likely require substantial investment and time. Under the baseline assumptions, Ukraine’s exports are only expected to recover to 2021 levels by 2031. Consequently, while net exports from Eastern Europe are expected to rise by just over 22% compared to the 2020-22 base period, the absolute growth in net exports is less than half of the level achieved in the past decade. Growth is expected to be concentrated in Russia and Türkiye, where exports are set to expand by 1.9% p.a. and 2.4% p.a. respectively. Combined with growth of 1.8% p.a. in exports from Western Europe, this is sufficient for the total Europe and Central Asian region to reach a small net trade surplus by 2032. Total exports from the region could expand 19% by 2032, due in large to a 23% expansion in crop product exports, with more subdued growth of 12% in animal-based products. Cereal exports are expected to rise by 20%, or 32 Mt by 2032, with Russia accounting for more than half of additional volumes. By 2032, the Europe and Central Asian region will account for 36% of global cereal exports, with both the Near East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa being significant importers. In line with the concentration in Russia, more than half of additional cereal exports by 2032 will be wheat, resulting in its increased share 118  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 in total cereal exports from the region. Maize exports are also expected to rise and by 2032, the region is set to contribute 22% of global maize trade. Europe and Central Asia contribute more than 40% of livestock product exports globally and almost 90% of these volumes come from the European Union. While growth in the European Union’s exports of animal\u0002based products is expected to slow compared to the past decade, the region still constitutes 46% of global trade in such products by 2032. Its share is significant in both meat and dairy products. In line with reduced production, meat exports from the European Union are expected to decline by 16%, but most of this emanates from the pigmeat sector, as poultry and bovine meat exports are anticipated to remain fairly stable. The reduction in pigmeat exports implies that its share in global pigmeat trade will decline to 31%. The European Union constitutes 28% of global dairy exports and growth of 1.6% p.a. is sufficient to sustain this share by 2032. Its relative contribution and growth prospects differ across the various dairy products. An increasing share of its smaller milk production pool will be processed into cheese and butter, enabling cheese exports to rise by almost 28% over the next ten years, while butter exports grow by 17%. This enhances its share in the global market to 43% by 2032. On the other hand, its share in the global trade of SMP and WMP is expected to decline. The region is also an important exporter of fish products, with Russia and Norway the major contributors. The region’s 26% share in global fish exports is the highest amongst those covered in this chapter. With growth set to slow to 0.3% p.a., the Developed and East Asia region will capture a bigger market share by 2032. Despite the shift to export orientation, the region also remains a significant importer of many agricultural products. By 2032, imports are anticipated to increase by 13%, though growth from Central Asia is much faster at almost 39%, from a smaller base. The growing export orientation in Europe, combined with rising imports from Central Asia implies that a substantial share of additional imports could be supplied from within the region. Around 15% of Central Asia’s additional imports is expected to be animal products, of which the European Union is a major supplier. Further to animal products, the region is a significant importer of rice and vegetable oil, as well as maize and protein meal for use in animal feed. For both protein meal, and to a lesser extent wheat, its share in global imports is expected to decline by 2032, due to its projected slowdown in livestock production growth and thus feed use.

Regional outlook: North America 2.6.1. Background Productive and resilient agro-food sector The North American region comprises just two countries, but it covers a vast land area, while its 375 million people comprise just 5% of the world’s population. This share could decline somewhat by 2032, as population growth in the region is slow at only 5.8% for the ten-year period. More than 80% of the population already resides in urban areas, with little change expected by 2032. Both the United States and Canada are highly developed countries with mature and diverse economies. This is reflected in the low share of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries in total regional GDP, which is already below 2% and expected to decline further by 2032. This does not detract from its contribution to global agriculture, where it provides 11% of total output. North America’s contribution to global agriculture reflects its sizable land base. It accounts for 10% of the land used for agriculture globally and the availability of agricultural land per capita is the highest amongst all regions included in the Outlook. Its agricultural trade surplus is the third largest among all regions, after Latin America and South and Southeast Asia and it accounts for 12% of global exports. While positive, growth in agricultural production has been among the slowest of all regions, outpacing only Developed and East Asia and Europe and Central Asia over the past decade. By 2032, its share in global output and exports is expected to diminish, while its trade surplus could decline to just a quarter of current levels. The region is highly productive, with an agricultural sector characterised by significant capital intensity and a predominance of large, commercially orientated farming enterprises that attain impressive yields. Production systems are input intensive and fertiliser application rates per hectare of cropland are high, implying that the sharp rise in fertiliser costs impacted substantially on producer margins. It also induced a reduction in fertiliser use per hectare in 2022, along with a heightened focus on optimising efficiency. Fertiliser imports into the United States declined by 22% in 2022. While prices normalise over the outlook period, fertiliser use per hectare does not fully recover to pre-2022 levels, reflecting the investments made to improve use efficiency, which also enable fertiliser use per calorie produced to decline further. Agricultural land use has stabilised over the past decade, with a consistent share of 37% dedicated to crop production. Thus, output growth has predominantly come from productivity gains. The relative importance of livestock is reflected in its 42% share of total agricultural production value, well above the global average of 36%. North America contributes 13% of the global value of livestock production, but thanks to high productivity, its share in livestock numbers is proportionately lower. North America has a mature, high income consumer base and food intake is highest amongst all regions. Calories and protein available for consumption is 30% and 36% higher respectively than the world average. Consequently, consumer preferences could play a bigger role than income growth in the evolution of food demand. Consumption is proportionately high in animal products, which comprise almost 30% of total calories and 65% of total protein intake, compared to the global average of 18% and 40% respectively. Diets are also high in vegetable oil and sweeteners, where calorie shares are almost double the global  123 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 average. Dietary composition and lifestyles in the region have led to higher incidence of obesity and food related chronic diseases such as diabetes, although the COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of healthy eating habits. This could have a lasting impact on consumer preferences and total calorie intake is expected to decline by 2032. Even at the height of the pandemic, total food consumption remained high, reflecting the maturity of the region’s consumer base, as well as income support measures that mitigated the effects of the economic contraction on spending power. Nevertheless, its influence on the composition and distribution of food sales was profound. Expenditure on food away from home declined, while retail sales increased, inducing significant changes in the food supply chain to adapt to both the type of food and packaging size requirements. Weersink et al. (2021[10]) note that, despite the time required to adapt to the changes, the adjustments in the supply chain have improved its resilience to future shocks. Despite high average levels of income and food intake, the region is not immune to food security concerns amongst the lower echelons of its income distribution. Even prior to the pandemic, an estimated 10-13% of the region’s population was estimated to experience food insecurity (Tarasuk and Mitchell, 2020[11]). Despite the mitigating effects of income support measures, the prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity increased for the first time in 2020 and remained elevated in 2021 amid rising food prices. The current environment of financial tightening, high inflation and persistently high food prices will weaken affordability and likely constrain significant improvements to food security in 2022 and 2023. The recovery from the pandemic induced recession in 2020 was robust and the 5.4% rebound in per capita GDP in 2021 elevated average per capita income beyond pre-pandemic levels. However, this momentum was short lived and as Russia’s war against Ukraine provided new impetus to energy prices and rising inflation, growth in per capita GDP slowed to 1.6% in 2022. Expectations are for a mere 0.1% in 2023. The outlook will continue to be shaped by tightening financial conditions, as monetary policy strives to keep inflation under control amid Russia’s war against Ukraine. In the medium term, growth in per capita income is expected to recover to an annual average of 1.1%, to exceed USD 62 100 per capita by 2032. Industrial use of agricultural products is high in North America and the United States is the biggest producer of biofuel in the world, accounting for almost 38% of global output. This comprises mainly ethanol, derived from maize feedstocks, with some biodiesel derived from soybean oil and used cooking oils. Biofuel use in the United States is sustained by the Renewable Fuel Standard. The United States also supplies substantial ethanol exports to Canada. The agriculture sector in North America is mature, productive, and resilient, contributing substantially to global production and exports of several products. Its ability to expand production may be critical to normalising the current high price cycle, amid ongoing war in the Black Sea region, particularly under conducive weather conditions. Nevertheless, it also faces challenges, as evidence suggests that its impressive historic productivity growth has slowed in the past decade (Fuglie, 2015[12]) and, as environmental costs continue to rise, competitiveness may be eroded in the future. 2.6.2. Production Productivity gains are the primary driver of growth Growth in agricultural and fish production in North America is expected to persist, but the expansion of 8% by 2032 is significantly slower than in the past. The strength of the US dollar is a contributing factor, combined with the expectation that most prices will normalise from current high levels and in the medium term, return to a long term trend of a decline in real terms. Growth in crop production is expected to outpace that of livestock, reversing the trend that emerged over the past decade. By 2032, an 12% expansion in crop production sees its share in total agricultural output rise to 55%, compared to 41% for livestock and only 4% from fisheries. 124  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The historic decline in land used for agriculture stabilised over the past decade. By 2032, little change is expected in total agricultural land use, though some reallocation may occur from cropland to pasture in the United States. Despite the consequent decline of 1.9% in total land used for crop production by 2032, output from the crop sector is expected to rise by an annual average of 0.8%, benefitting from a combination of intensification and yield gains. The total area harvested is expected to decline by 1.2 Mha, less than half of the decline in land use. Similarly, the total value of crop production per hectare of land is expected to rise by 14%. This increase is more pronounced in Canada, where it reverses an historic decline. The area under cereals and oilseeds is expected to expand by only 2.4% by 2032 but will still constitute the bulk of total area harvested, with almost 60% dedicated to maize, wheat and soybeans. Among smaller crops, the area under pulses and cotton could grow by 28% and 11% respectively. Despite the faster expansion, pulses will still only account for 4% of total area in the region, but in Canada their share is more prominent at 14%. Yield gains are expected to remain robust across all commodities, but growth rates differ. Maize yields already average more than 10 t/ha in the 2020-22 base period, which is 80% above the global average. By 2032, they are expected to rise by only 5%. Similarly, soybean yields are expected to rise by 7%, whereas for wheat and other coarse grains, yield gains are expected to be higher at 13% and 16% respectively. This reflects a degree of recovery, as wheat and barley yields were significantly reduced in 2021, due to inclement weather conditions, particularly in Canada. Meat production systems in North America are highly intensive and profitability has come under severe pressure in recent years – initially due to weak prices at the height of the pandemic induced lockdown in 2020 and subsequently due to the sharp and persistent rise in feed costs. In the short term, these factors combined to result in reduced production volumes of both pigmeat and bovine meat, as well as a dramatic slowdown of poultry production. While some recovery is evident in the medium term once feed prices normalise, the net results is substantially slower growth in meat production, which is expected to rise by only 5.4% by 2032, to approach 56 Mt. The United States is expected to account for 90%. Poultry production is expected to grow faster than any other meat type, expanding by 8.2% over the ten-year period, compared to merely 3.3% for pigmeat and 2.6% for bovine meat, where production cycles are longer and the response to improved profitability takes longer. While improved profitability in the medium term could induce some expansion in poultry and pigmeat operations, bovine production growth is exclusively driven by productivity gains and increased carcass weights, as bovine herd numbers are not expected to fully recover to pre-2022 levels by 2032. Milk production growth is expected to exceed that of meat and by 2032, could expand by 14% relative to the 2020-22 base period. These gains are derived predominantly from increased milk yields, which are already the highest of all regions. Cow inventories are only expected to rise by 2% ‒ mainly in the United States, as Canada’s dairy cow herd remain largely unchanged. By 2032, milk yields in the United States and Canada are expected to rise by 10% and 20% respectively. Consumer preferences dictate that an increasing share of total milk production is expected to be processed into products such as cheese, butter, and milk powders, with less going to fluid milk. Captured fisheries still constitute the bulk of fish production in North America. Despite relative stability by 2032 in captured fisheries, growth of only 4.3% in aquaculture production implies that 88% of total production is still expected to come from captured fisheries. This also reflects the fact that production will be significantly impacted by environmental regulations. At present, 84% of total production comes from the United States, but the bulk of production growth is expected to come from Canada. The North American region is responsible for 7% of direct agriculture related GHG emissions globally – less than its share in global output. While total agriculture emissions are expected to rise by 1.5% over the coming decade, the total emissions per unit of output value is expected to decline further. Additional emissions emanate mainly from livestock production, with increases of 0.45% p.a., compared to 0.12% p.a. from crop production.  125 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 2.6.3. Consumption Changing consumer preferences are key to demand prospects The highly developed nature of the United States and Canadian economies means that its mature, higher income consumers spend on average only 6% of total household expenditure on food. This implies that the current high food price cycle will present less of an affordability challenge than in many other regions, and that medium term demand prospects will to a large extent be dictated by the preferences of these consumers, with comparatively less influence from their economic means. Many of the expected changes in these preferences are centred around an increased focus on healthy eating habits, which was amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a shift would influence the absolute level of calories consumed, as well as their composition. Total calories available for consumption, which includes substantial household waste, is the highest in the world. By 2032, it is expected to decline by almost 80kcal/person/day, to 3750 kcal/person/day – still 22% above the global average. Accounting for current estimates of household waste would bring caloric intake to 3480 kcal/person/day. The bulk of the decline emanates from the United States, with a far smaller reduction expected in Canada. In terms of composition, the heightened focus on health may induce a shift to increased fresh produce consumption, with fruit consumption per capita expected to rise by 14%. It is also foreseen to induce a reduction in products such as vegetable oil (-8%), sweeteners (-8.5%) and cereals (-1.2%). Meat consumption is expected to remain fairly stable, increasing by just 0.6% over the ten-year period, whereas the consumption of dairy products, on a dry matter basis, could rise by 3% and pulses, which are often perceived as healthy alternatives, could rise by 24%. This increase is from a small base, however, and by 2032, pulse consumption per capita will still be less than half of the global average, whereas consumption of products such as vegetable oil and sweeteners remain 125% and 77% respectively above the global average. Protein intake in North America is expected to rise by a mere 1.8g/person/day by 2032, to reach 116g/person/day – still more than 30% above the global average. This increase is derived predominantly from animal sources, which are expected to rise by 2% over the ten year period, compared to just 0.4% from plant-based sources. While meat consumption remains fairly stable, increased intake of poultry and pigmeat products, combined with reductions in bovine and ovine meat consumption still enables a 1.7% increase in protein availability from meat products. Similarly, increased dairy product consumption encompasses an almost 17% increase in cheese intake, compared to a 2.4% gain in butter and reduced milk powder and fresh dairy consumption. Overall, this results in a 1.9% gain in protein available from dairy products by 2032. Per capita consumption of fish products is also expected to rise, to reach 23 kg per capita by 2032, a gain of 2.5% compared to 2020-22. In the case of plant-based protein sources, a gain of 0.4g of protein per person per day from pulses, is almost fully offset by the reduction in cereal consumption. The intensity of livestock production in the region implies that feed use is already high, with calories dedicated to animal feed already exceeding those consumed as food in the base period (Figure 2.23). In line with expansion in pigmeat and poultry production, feed use is expected to rise by 13% over the coming decade, with maize and protein meal comprising almost 90% of the additional feed. By 2032, the share of maize in total feed use could rise to 55%, whereas the share of protein meal remains fairly constant at 17%. Biofuel production is an important market for feed grains in the region, accounting for more calories than food or feed in the base period (Figure 2.23). The increasing focus on sustainability is reflected in further growth of 15% in biofuel production by 2032. Almost two-thirds of this growth is attributed to biodiesel, underpinned by increased renewable fuel targets and biomass-based diesel tax credits. The prevalence of used cooking oil as feedstock is expected to increase. Growth in ethanol production is slower, partly due to reduced gasoline use. Positive production growth reflects some additional E15 blends, but most of the 126  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 gasoline will still be blended at 10%, as limitations in infrastructure and technology constrains wider adoption of mid to high level blending.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/7hb1tv 2.6.4. Trade Trade surpluses continue to shrink In line with the prevailing trend of the past decade, North America’s trade surplus in agriculture and food products is expected to decline further and, by 2032, could be almost 75% smaller than current levels. This follows growth in net imports, which are expected to increase by 20% over the ten-year period, more than double the expected gain in net exports, which only rise by 8.6%. Trade developments in the United States also diverge from Canada, where the trade surplus is expected to grow by 3% p.a., but the United States is expected to move from a surplus in the 2020-22 base period, to a deficit position by 2032. Amongst the factors contributing to the marked deceleration in export growth from the United States, is the slowdown in global demand, as well as its trade relations with China, which is the single biggest importer of US products, and rising competition from Latin America. After a period of turbulence, trade relations between the United States and China have improved, suggesting that the projected slowdown is mostly a factor of China’s demand dynamics. Historic trade growth was driven mainly by feed products, such as soybeans and maize, due to rapid expansion in China’s pigmeat and poultry operations, particularly in the years of rebuilding from the devastating impact of ASF. Consequently, soybean imports increased by nearly 4% p.a. over the past decade. In line with China’s meat production dynamics, these imports are expected to be sustained, but further growth is limited at just 0.7% p.a. In the case of maize, China’s imports are expected to decline. Amid rising competition from Latin America, the concomitant reduction in US exports of 8% for both soybeans and maize represents a marked turnaround, as these two products combined accounted for 45% of export growth over the past decade. Amid the slowdown in demand from China, opportunities for export growth could come from within the region, through the United States\u00020 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Food Feed Biofuel Other bln cal/year 2010-12 2020-22 2032  127 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Mexico-Canada (USMCA) Agreement, which was implemented on 1 July 2020 to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Canada is already the second biggest export destination for US products and trade under the agreement has already grown substantially since its inception. In line with its diminishing surplus, the North American region is also expected to account for a smaller share in global trade for several products. These include soybeans and maize, where its share in global exports could decline to 34% and 29% respectively by 2032, due to increasing competition from Latin America and the Caribbean. Conversely, it is expected to gain market share in wheat, partly due to the ongoing war in the Black Sea region, which constrains export growth from Ukraine in particular. The North American region is also expected to expand its share in global ethanol exports to almost 58% by 2032. Similarly, its share in global pigmeat exports could rise to 44%, while its contribution to global dairy exports could reach 17%, due mainly to growth in skim milk powders. Despite its trade surplus and prolific role in global exports, the North American region is also a significant importer of several products. These include fish, bovine and ovine meat. Its share in bovine and ovine meat imports continues to decline, to the extent that it has in the past decade become a net exporter of bovine products, but it is still expected to account for 14% of global imports by 2032. In the case of fish, its imports continue to rise by 1.1% p.a. and by 2032, it will account for almost 16% of global fish imports. The region is also a major importer of fresh fruit and vegetables, which is expected to rise further to account for 18% and 23% of global imports respectively by 2032. Figure 2.24.

Regional outlook: Latin America and the Caribbean 2.7.1. Background Export led growth facing increased risk amid global volatility The Latin America and Caribbean16 region spans some 2 billion hectares and contains an abundance of agricultural resources. It houses more than 650 million people, almost 8.5% of the global population. While its average population density is low, it is the most urbanised amongst the developing regions. By 2032, its population is expected to exceed 700 million, of which 84% could reside in urban settings. This implies that most of the regions poor live in urban areas, but at the same time, the obstinately high incidence of poverty in rural settings presents significant challenges. The disruptions of the past three years reversed years of progress in reducing poverty and hunger in the region. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the combination of economic recession, deteriorating financial conditions and value chain disruptions resulted in a substantial increase in the prevalence of undernourishment and food insecurity. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean suggests that the pandemic pushed the extreme poverty rate in the region to 13.8% by 2021, implying that the number of people living in extreme poverty reached 86 million. During the subsequent period of rising food prices, the prevalence of undernourishment increased further and in 2021, reached levels last seen in 2006. In 2022, the persistently high global food prices, which was exacerbated by Russia’s war against Ukraine, combined with high general inflation, left little room for improvements in affordability and consequently food security, particularly in a region where the cost of healthy eating is the highest of those covered in this chapter (FAO, IFAD, PAHO, UNICEF and WFP, 2023[13]). Economic prospects across much of the region have been uncertain for some time and income levels per capita contracted by an annual average of 1.5% over the past decade. Pre-existing structural challenges accentuated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2020, per capita GDP declined by 7.1%. Propelled by high commodity prices and the substantial role of trade in the region, GDP rebounded by 5.9% in 2021 and a further 2.7% in 2022, enabling per capita income to surpass pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, the rebound is facing renewed resistance ‒ inflation has reached a 25-year high, inducing interest rate hikes, and global conditions are less supportive. Commodity prices are softening, and global demand is weakening amid tighter financial conditions. Consequently, per capita GDP growth in Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to slow to less than 1% in 2023. Across the diverse range of countries in the region, the magnitude of the rebound and subsequent slowdown differs, depending on the composition of economic activity and the extent of domestic risks that amplify global effects. In the medium term, per capita GDP is expected to rise by 1.6% p.a., to approach USD 10 500 per capita by 2032. This is only 6% higher than in 2014 and remains 21% below the global average of USD 13 342. On average across the region, households are estimated to spend around 16% of total expenditure on food. This suggests that the current cycle of high food prices, combined with elevated inflation and slower income growth in the short term could impact significantly on food security in the coming decade;17 In countries with heightened macroeconomic instability, this impact could be even more pronounced. 132  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Agriculture in the region is highly diverse. Farm structures range from , to some 15 million smallholder and family farms responsible for much of the region’s food production ( (OECD/FAO, 2019[14]). Agriculture and fish production accounts for almost 8% of total GDP. This share increased at the height of the pandemic, thanks to agriculture’s robust performance and exemption from lockdown restrictions. The prolonged period of high prices further benefitted agricultural performance, sustaining its share in total GDP. As other sectors continue to recover and agricultural commodity prices normalise, it is anticipated that the share of agriculture and fish production in total economic activity will decline to below 7% by 2032. Short term impediments such as drought in Brazil or Argentina could accelerate this decline. The region is a major contributor to global agriculture. Between 2020 and 2022, it accounted for 14% of the net value of agriculture and fish production globally and its share in total exports is higher at 17%. The importance of agricultural exports in the region is further underscored by its growing share in total production value, which has risen to 45%. Historic export growth has been aided by greater competitiveness, with total factor productivity increasing by 40% from 2000 to 2019.18 Despite lower labour input, output growth has been underpinned by rising material inputs, notably fertiliser, which doubled over the period 2000 to 2019. Increasing cost pressure over the past two years, combined with availability constraints in 2022 following Russia’s war against Ukraine curtailed historically high fertiliser application rates. With expected growth in the coming decade predominantly export led, input use efficiency and the success of its climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies will be critical to maintain and grow competitiveness, as will global approaches regarding openness to trade and an increased focus on environmental sustainability by some major importers. Despite the region’s significant export orientation, several countries in the region are also net importers, such as Panama, El Salvador and most of the Caribbean, but intra-regional trade remains low. As the biggest net exporter amongst all the regions covered in the Outlook, it is paradoxical that some of its major challenges relate to food security. These emanate from affordability constraints, rather than availability, and are underpinned by a combination of income distributional issues and current high prices. A major contributor has been rising poverty over the past decade, exacerbated by disruptions such as the pandemic and macroeconomic instability in many countries. The region’s robust export orientation shielded agricultural growth from the macroeconomic challenges, but also made it vulnerable to increasing volatility, tighter financial conditions and weaker import demand globally in the near term. Post-pandemic, an increasing focus on development of domestic supply chains and the heightened awareness of environmental sustainability among some importers may influence trade policy and subsequent export prospects. Other trade related issues arise from increased concentration of exports by destination, which exposes export demand to higher market risks. Further to trade related risks, the sectors adaptation strategies and resilience to climate change impacts will be critical to sustained growth. 2.7.2. Production Steady and sustained yield growth boosts crops and livestock Agricultural and fish production in the region is projected to expand by 12% by 2032, markedly slower than in the past. Almost 70% of this growth is expected to come from crop production (+17%), compared to a more muted expansion of 11% in the livestock sector and a contraction of 10% in the value of fish production. Consequently, the share of crops in total production value is set to rise further to almost 60% by 2032, with a further 42% attributed to livestock and 9% to fish. The region’s land abundance contributes to strong crop production growth, which is derived from a combination of expansion and intensification. Total land used for agriculture is expected to rise by 6.3 Mha, reversing a historic trend of decline. This includes a 7.1 Mha expansion in cropland, as well as a small reduction in pasture. Amid rising prevalence of double cropping, the expansion in total area harvested, at 7%, is significantly faster than that of crop land use. Of the additional 13.9 Mha added to total area  133 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 harvested by 2032, more than half is dedicated to maize and soybeans, which account for 29% and 22% of the expansion respectively by 2032. The region already accounts for just over half of global soybean production, and this share is expected to rise to 54% by 2032. Consequently, supply fluctuations within the region, particularly Brazil as its biggest producer, can cause substantial world price volatility. This was evident by the sharp increase in soybean prices amid drought conditions in 2021 and, in the face of ongoing climate change, such events may become more frequent. Many countries in the region are already challenged by prolonged drought conditions, which influence productive potential, as well as the prevalence of natural disasters such as wildfires. Under normal weather conditions, the region has ample potential to fill supply gaps resulting from reduced production in Ukraine, but heightened uncertainty from the ongoing war in the Black Sea region further accentuates price responses to weather conditions in the Latin America and Caribbean region. While its contribution to global maize production is smaller than that of soybeans, production growth of 1.5% p.a. is sufficient to push the region’s share in total maize production to 19% by 2032, with Brazil contributing more than half. Further to area expansion, yield gains were instrumental to the regions strong production growth. The region is an intensive user of fertiliser and application rates per hectare increased faster than any other region over the past decade. Recent high prices heightened awareness of optimizing efficiency in fertiliser use and over the coming decade, application rates per hectare are expected to rise by only 4%. Nevertheless, the combination of technological innovation and practices that optimize efficiency support expected yield gains in most major crops, including a 9% gain in cereal yields and a 12% gain in oilseed yields by 2032. This also enables further improvement of 12% in the net value of production per hectare of cropland, as well as a 6% reduction in the fertiliser required per calorie produced. The region provides 16% of global livestock production and while growth of 1% p.a. is expected to be slower than in the crop sector, it is sufficient to sustain its contribution to global value. Growth prospects are sensitive to the risks posed by animal disease. Among the various meats, poultry is expected to grow the fastest, enabling it to account for just over 60% of additional meat production by 2032. Its short production cycle aids rapid improvements in genetics and feed conversion, supporting growth prospects, while the decline in feed prices relative to meat in the medium term will incentivise expansion. Bovine and pigmeat are expected to grow by 0.9% p.a. and 1.2% p.a. respectively, but the bovine sector is bigger and will account for 22% of additional meat production by 2032. Productivity gains will be instrumental to growth, as an 9% expansion in beef production results from a mere 3% expansion in the beef herd by 2032. Fish production comprises just 11% of total value in the region and this share is expected to decline to 9% by 2032, due to a 10% contraction in total output. Production is still predominantly derived from captured fisheries, but aquaculture is developing in several countries and by 2032, is expected to contribute 30% of total fish production. Captured fisheries are expected to remain volatile over the projection period, influenced by intermittent El Niño effects, which have a strong impact in the region and tends to influence fish used for the production fishmeal and fish oil. GHG emissions from agriculture are expected to rise by 3% over the coming decade, form both crop and livestock products. By 2032, the region is expected to account for almost 18% of the global emissions from agriculture, higher than its share in total output. Nevertheless, expressed relative to the net value of agricultural production, emissions per unit value of output are set to decline consistently over the next ten years. 2.7.3. Consumption Dietary patterns are complex but evolving A decade of growth in total calorie availability in the region has largely stagnated since 2015. This mirrors movements in per capita income levels, which declined because of macroeconomic instability. More 134  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 recently, the pandemic induced recession in 2020 and subsequent increase in food prices further constrained affordability of nutritious food products, resulting in consecutive years of decline in calories available for consumption. By 2032, average per capita intake is expected to reach 3 111 kcal/person per year, but growth is slow at only 3% for the ten-year period. This marks an increase of only 89 kcal/person/day, due to gains in consumption of cereals, meat, dairy and vegetable oil, along with reduced sugar consumption. Despite the decline of 2 kg per person per year by 2032, sugar consumption in the region remains high, at almost 65% above the global average. In a region challenged by the double burden of persistent food insecurity and malnutrition in all its form, amid rising prevalence of overweight and obesity, the reduction in sugar consumption reflects a shift to increased health awareness, which benefits from the introduction of initiatives such as front of package labelling legislation and sugar sweet beverage taxes. While efforts to induce healthy eating may start to bear fruit, the current cycle of high food prices continues to challenge food security and nutritional quality. Persistently high costs of healthy diets and affordability constraints amongst those on lower incomes affect both the quality and quantity of food intake, despite the positive impact of initiatives such as school feeding programs, which are estimated to benefit up to 37% of the poorer members of the population. Per capita protein consumption is expected to reach 90g/person/day by 2032, an increase of 3.5g/person from current levels. This gain largely accrues to animal products, which accounts for two-thirds of the growth in protein availability. Meat consumption is expected to rise by 2.9 kg per capita to almost 53 kg/person/year by 2032 – almost 80% higher than the global average. Growth is derived from poultry and pigmeat, where consumption is expected to rise by 0.6% p.a., while a modest decline is expected in bovine meat consumption by 2032. Fish consumption in the region is still low, around half of the global average, but is set to expand by 0.3% p.a., to reach 11 kg/person/year by 2032. Animal feed use is expected to rise by 13% over the next ten years, faster than meat and dairy production. This comes despite expected genetic improvement that results in better feed conversion ratios and reflects further intensification in livestock production systems, which is integral to growth. More than 60% of additional feed use comes from maize, with an additional 24% from protein meal, mirroring typical ratios in poultry rations and resulting in growth of 15% in maize and protein meal feed use. The region is also a major contributor to the global ethanol market and by 2032 is expected to raise its share in world production to 31%. Brazil constitutes almost 90% of ethanol production and use in the region. Sustained by its RenovaBio programme, designed to reduce emission intensity as part of its COP 21 commitments, ethanol use is expected to rise by 35% over the coming decade. Its rate of production growth is only marginally slower at 33%, with sugarcane expected to remain the primary feedstock. Consequently, Brazil’s share in global ethanol exports could decline to 15% by 2032. 2.7.4. Trade Exports are key to sustained agricultural growth Latin America and the Caribbean is the largest net exporter amongst all the regions included in this Chapter. Exports have been integral to its agricultural growth, reducing its exposure to the macroeconomic instability within the region and improving resilience to exogenous shocks. The share of exports in total agricultural production has increased consistently and is expected to reach 50% by 2032. This follows an expected expansion of 27% in its trade surplus for agricultural products, which will also push its share in global exports to almost 18% by 2032. Brazil is the biggest exporter in the region and the primary driver of growth, but its projected expansion of 1.8% p.a. is significantly slower than the 6% p.a. achieved over the past decade. Other notable contributors to regional export growth include Mexico and Argentina, while exports of fresh fruit from Peru are also expected to rise rapidly.  135 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The region counts amongst the leading global exporters for a range of commodities and by 2032 is expected to sustain a global export share of more than 30% for maize, soybeans, sugar, beef, poultry and fishmeal. In the case of maize, soybeans and beef, expected export growth is sufficient to increase its global market share to 44%, 64% and 43% respectively. Its share of sugar and poultry exports globally is also expected to increase marginally to 55% and 31% respectively, whereas reduced production volumes result in a declining share of the world’s fishmeal exports. The importance of exports to agriculture in the region is underscored by its central position in global trade, as well as the pivotal role of exports in driving production growth. Sustained growth will depend on continued orientation towards open trade in the global market. The disruptions of the past three years exposed vulnerabilities in the global trade system, which resulted in logistical bottlenecks and rising costs. Amid the crises, many exporting countries imposed trade policies that prioritise domestic supply, creating opportunities for the Latin American and Caribbean region, which did not impose restrictions, to gain export market share. At the same time, the development of domestic supply chains has been prioritised in many parts of the world, to mitigate risks of disruption. Over the coming decade, the evolution of trade relations in various parts of the world will influence the region, creating both new opportunities and further risks. While export led growth has served it well in the past, the global market is increasingly volatile and international trade more fragile, with risks of geopolitical fragmentation. Improved internal market integration and functioning of small and medium enterprises, cooperatives and family farms could expand trade within the region, thus diversifying market opportunities and bolstering the sector’s resilience.

Projections cover consumption, production, trade and prices for maize, rice, wheat and other coarse grains. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key risks and uncertainties which could have implications for world cereal markets over the next decade. 3 Cereals 144  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 3.1. Projection highlights Demand growth is slowing down, yields drive production Over the next ten years, the growth of cereal demand is expected to be slower than the past decade due to weaker growth in feed demand, biofuels and other industrial uses. Moreover, in many countries direct human per capita food consumption of most cereals is approaching saturation levels, thus constraining growth in overall demand. Most of the increase in food demand is linked to population growth, particularly in low- and lower middle-income countries. Population-driven increases in the consumption of wheat and rice are expected in Asia, and of millet, sorghum, and white maize in Africa, while the growing role of rice in African diets is projected to translate into continued increases in its per capita food use in that continent. In the next decade, global cereal production growth will be due to higher yields and more intensive use of existing arable land. The expected increase is attributed to the wider availability and adoption of new and improved seed varieties, more intense and efficient use of inputs and improved agricultural practices. Furthermore, market turbulence could revive policies aimed at increasing domestic production to reduce exposure to global markets. On the other hand, growth in production might be limited by the impacts of climate change on yields, a lack of access to new technologies in certain countries as well as insufficient investments. Moreover, heightened environmental awareness and new environmental policies could dampen yield growth. Global production of cereals is projected to increase from its current level by about 320 Mt to 3.1 bln t by 2032, largely from maize and rice. As over the past decade, the increase is expected to originate primarily in Asian countries, which will account for about 45% of global growth. Africa, where maize and other coarse grains will be the primary drivers of growth, is expected to contribute larger shares to global growth of cereal production than over the past decade. Latin America and the Caribbean will also generate a substantial portion of the increase, largely of maize. Under the assumption of average growing conditions, Oceania is not expected to maintain the record production levels experienced in the base period (Figure 3.1). Overall, 17% of global cereal production was traded internationally in 2022. However, this share varies across the different cereals ranging from 10% for rice to 25% for wheat. This ratio is expected to remain stable over the next decade. Asia is projected to maintain its position as world largest rice exporting region, while countries in Latin America and the Caribbean will mostly import wheat and export maize. Many African and Asian countries are expected to become more reliant on cereal imports during the next decade. It is projected that world cereal trade will increase by 11%, totalling 530 Mt by 2032. Wheat will contribute to 43% of this growth, while the rest is shared by maize (34%) and rice (20%) and other coarse grains (3%). The Russian Federation (hereafter “Russia”) is projected to remain the largest wheat exporter, supplying 23% of global exports in 2032. The United States will remain the leading exporter of maize closely followed by Brazil, while the European Union will remain the main exporter of other coarse grains. India, Thailand and Viet Nam will continue to be the leading rice exporters, with Cambodia and Myanmar playing an increasingly significant export role. As in the past years, Chinese feed demand is expected to be a key factor in cereal markets. The projections assume Chinese imports of maize and wheat stay below recent peaks and reach 19 Mt and 7.5 Mt respectively by 2032. The 2023/24 season is expected to continue to see high nominal grain prices. However, assuming average yields and geopolitical stability, the long-term downward trend in real terms may resume and continue until 2032.  145 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 3.1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/k9uasr The COVID-19 pandemic restrictions (some still in place in the People’s Republic of China ‒ hereafter “China”), Russia’s war against Ukraine, animal diseases, reduced production in some countries due to extreme weather events, high fertiliser and transport costs, and the macroeconomic environment, including high inflation, have caused a surge in grain prices. These factors are expected to subside by 2024 but may still influence prices during the outlook period. Furthermore, trade disruptions due to political instability and attempts to control domestic inflation can also have a profound effect on markets. Certain countries have expressed their intent to develop strategies to manage domestic prices, such as stock building, export restrictions, import barriers and increasing subsidies for producers and consumers, but the implementation of these measures is often unclear and financially difficult to achieve. 3.2. Current market trends Wheat and coarse grain prices below recent peaks The 2022/23 market situation of grains (wheat and coarse grains) is somewhat mixed compared to the preceding season. Global wheat production has reached unprecedented levels and global stocks are increasing. By contrast, production of maize and other coarse grains has not been sufficient to meet demand, leading to an expected drawdown of global coarse grain stocks by the close of season in 2023. Although the Black Sea Grain Initiative has facilitated the movement of more than 15 million tonnes of cereals until April 2023 which has helped to increase supplies and quell some of the uncertainty in grain markets, supplies from Ukraine remain constrained. As for rice, after successive years of bumper harvests, inclement weather and hikes in production costs are set to lower world rice production in 2022/23, although a still robust level of plantings is expected to keep the global harvest at an above-average level. The season’s anticipated production reduction, combined with policy changes, may forestall further increases in global rice utilisation and reduce world trade in rice 2023. However, efforts to reconstitute stocks by some countries are expected to keep world rice stocks in 2022/23 at their second highest level on record. -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Oceania Europe Latin America and the Caribbean North America Africa Asia Mt Rice Maize Wheat Other coarse grains 146  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 3.3. Market projections 3.3.1. Consumption Asian countries will lead demand growth of cereals for food and feed Cereal demand will continue to be dominated by food use closely followed by feed use. In 2032, 41% of all cereals will be directly consumed by humans, while 37% will be used for animal feeds. Biofuels and other uses are projected to account for the remaining 22% These shares, however, differ across the different cereal types. While wheat and rice is mainly used for food, feed use dominates maize and other coarse grains (Figure 3.2). Figure 3.2. Global use of cereals in 2032 Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/tegpql Between 49% and 65% of global cereal consumption occurs in the top 5 consumer countries of each commodity (Figure 3.3), which is clearly less concentrated than production (see Figure 3.4 below). Global use of cereals is projected to increase slightly from 2.8 bln t in the base period to 3.1 bln t by 2032, driven mainly by higher food use (+148 Mt), followed by feed use (+130 Mt). Asian countries will account for near half of the projected demand increase. Increased global consumption of cereals for feed is expected to be dominated by maize (1.3% p.a.), followed by wheat (0.9% p.a.) and other coarse grains (0.6% p.a.) over the next decade. Consumption of cereals for food is expected to increase at a slower rate than in the previous decade. Wheat consumption is expected to be 11% higher in 2032 than in the base period. Four countries account for two-fifths of this increase: India, Pakistan, Egypt, and China.

Globally, the projected increase in consumption of wheat for food is more than three times larger than that for feed, especially in Asia where there is increasing demand for processed products, such as pastries and noodles. These products call for higher quality, protein rich wheat, produced in the United States, Canada, Australia and, to a lesser extent, in the European Union. Countries in the North Africa and Western Asia, such as Egypt, Türkiye, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, will remain major consumers of wheat with high levels of per capita consumption. Global production of wheat-based ethanol is expected to recover as production increases in India offsetting the reduction in other countries. Figure 3.3.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/p8krid Global maize consumption is projected to increase by 1.2% p.a., a much slower pace compared to 2.3% p.a. in the previous decade. This increase is principally driven by higher incomes that translate into higher feed demand, which accounts for the largest share of total utilisation, rising from 57% in the base period to around 59% by 2032. 52% of the increase in feed consumption will be in Asian countries (more than half of this in China) due to fast expanding livestock and poultry sectors. Feed demand globally is expected to rise by 110 Mt to 794 Mt, mainly in China, the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, Argentina, India, Viet Nam, and Egypt. Consumption in Southeast Asia will increase due to its fast-expanding poultry industry. The use of maize as food is expected to increase primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa where population growth is strong. White maize1 will remain an important staple, accounting for about a quarter of total caloric intake. Growth in maize consumption as food in African countries is expected at about 2.7% p.a. on average. Globally, maize use for biofuel production is expected to increase at a much slower rate than in the past two decades as national ethanol markets of key producers are constrained by biofuel policies. Brazil and the United States together account for more than 80% of the increase.

The food share of total consumption is projected to increase from about 26% in the base period to 29% by 2032. Sub-Saharan African countries, especially Ethiopia, rely heavily on millet as a food source owing to its resistance to droughts and the diverse climate conditions in the region. Rice is primarily consumed as food and is a major food staple in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and increasingly in Africa. World rice consumption is expected to increase by 1.1% p.a., compared to 0.9% p.a. during the last decade, with Asian countries accounting for 66% of the projected increase, largely due to population rather than per capita consumption growth (Table 3.1). Across the various regions, only Africa is projected to see notable increases in per capita food intake of rice. At the global level, the average per capita food use of rice is projected to increase by 0.9 kg to around 53 kg per year. Table 3.1.

Production Improved technology and cultivation practices sustain yield and production growth The global area harvested to cereals is expected to grow by 14.6 Mha (2%) by 2032. It will expand mainly in Latin American and the Caribbean countries by about 5 Mha, notably in Argentina and Brazil. Globally, wheat, maize and rice areas are projected to increase respectively by 1%, 5% and 1%, while other coarse grains areas are expected to remain unchanged. Decreasing harvested areas of rice in China, Japan and Brazil will be offset by gains in India, Thailand and African countries. Land availability compared to the previous decade is going to be limited in the future, as many governments place constraints on converting forest or pasture into arable land, as well as ongoing urbanisation, so increased global production is expected to be largely driven by intensification. This growth in yields from improving technology and cultivation practices, in middle-income countries in particular, is expected to sustain future cereals production. Globally, yields are projected to grow about 8% for wheat and other coarse grains, 9% for maize and 10% for rice. Global wheat production is expected to increase by 76 Mt to 855 Mt by 2032, of which 40 Mt will be in Asia (Figure 3.1), a slower growth rate than in the last decade. India, the world’s third largest wheat producer, is expected to provide the largest share of the additional wheat, accounting for more than a quarter of the global production increase, driven by yield improvements and area expansion in response to national policies to improve self-sufficiency. There will also be significant production increases in Russia, Canada, Argentina and Pakistan. The European Union is  149 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 projected to become the largest producer of wheat by 2032 (Figure 3.4), overtaking China, where wheat production is responding to demand decreases from negative population growth. Figure 3.4. Global cereal production concentration in 2032 Note: Presented numbers refer to shares in world totals of the respective variable Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/kx562v Global maize production is expected to grow by 165 Mt to 1.36 bln t by 2032, with the largest increases in the United States and China, followed by Brazil, Argentina and India. Increased production in Brazil will be largely driven by higher second-cropped maize following the soybean harvest. Production growth in the United States is expected below the global average of 1.2% p.a., at 0.6% p.a. over the next ten years. In Sub-Saharan Africa, total maize output is projected to increase by 24 Mt, of which white maize will account for the largest share. Increases in maize production are expected to stem primarily from yield improvements. Maize production in China decreased between 2015 and 2018 due to policy changes in 2016 that reduced price support to end stock piling; these were replaced with market-oriented purchasing policies combined with direct subsidies to farmers. In 2015, the stock-to-use ratio of maize was estimated at almost 80%, falling to about 52% in the past three years, which is very close to the ratio estimated for the period 2007 to 2009 before stocks started to accumulate. This indicates that the temporary stocks were depleted by 2019. A stock-to-use ratio of about 50% is assumed during the outlook period. With Chinese farmers adapting to the new policy, maize production should gain in competitiveness. Indeed, China is projected to contribute almost a fourth to increases in global maize output. Global production of other coarse grains is projected to reach 330 Mt by 2032, up 23 Mt from the base period. African countries will contribute almost 75% to this increase. Africa has the fastest growing population and relies on grains such as millet and sorghum, mainly for food. On a single country basis, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Argentina will contribute most to global production growth. Output in the European Union will decrease compared to the base period, which includes the record harvest of 2020, due to slower growth in feed demand.

Yield improvements are expected to drive this growth. Production expansions in Asian countries, which account for the bulk of global rice output, are expected to be robust. The highest growth is expected in India, followed by the LDC Asian region, Viet Nam, Thailand and China. India will remain a major producer of indica and basmati rice. China, the world’s largest rice producer, is expected to increase production at a similar pace to the last ten years. As most other major rice producers, projected output gains in China are expected to rely on yield improvements, amid expectations that efforts to move least productive land out cultivation will continue, as part of broader efforts to improve the quality of rice production. Production in high-income countries, such as the Korea, Japan is expected to remain on a downward trend. While output in the European Union will remain close to base period levels, in the United States and Australia it will expand by about 0.7% and 1.7% p.a. respectively. 3.3.3. Trade Trade in cereals will remain buoyant but with changing country shares Trade in cereals presently accounts for about 17% of global consumption and this share is projected to stay at a similar level until 2032. Traditionally, the Americas and Europe supply cereals to Asia and Africa, where growing demand for food and feed from rising populations and expanding livestock sectors is rising faster than domestic production. This buoyant trend is expected to continue over the next decade with exports of cereals increasing by 11% from the base period to 2032. Figure 3.5 illustrates how important cereal trade is relative to production and consumption. Net trade of cereals is low for Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean, although the two regions are expected to have among the highest shares of grain exports in national production, 62% and 35% respectively by 2032. Amongst all regions, it is Africa where imports of cereals contribute most to domestic consumption and by 2032 almost 34% of domestic cereal use in Africa will originate from non-African countries. Wheat exports are expected to grow by 20 Mt to 214 Mt by 2032, with Russia expected to maintain its position as the main exporter, accounting for 23% of global exports by 2032 (Figure 3.6). The European Union, the second largest wheat exporter, will account for 17% of global trade in 2032, although exports are projected below the record volumes of 2019 and 2022. Compared to the base period, the European Union is expected to maintain international market shares mainly due to constrained growth in the Black Sea region. For the same reason, and due to the harvest failure of 2021 that reduced the base period trade volume, Canada is expected to gain export shares and reach 13% of global wheat exports by 2032. The United States, Canada, Australia and the European Union are expected to retain the higher quality protein wheat markets, particularly in Asia. Russia and Ukraine may play a role in these markets, but will be more competitive in soft wheat markets, such as East Africa and the Middle East. Wheat imports by the North African and the Near East regions are set to slightly increase the share of their imports in total trade from 25% currently to 26% over the next decade.  151 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 3.5.

The LDC Sub-Saharan African region is expected to remain virtually self-sufficient in maize, with white maize continuing to play a key role for food security as a mainstay in local diets. South Africa will remain a regional supplier, but expansion will be limited as they produce genetically modified organisms (GMO) varieties that face import restrictions in neighbouring countries. Mexico is projected to become the largest maize importer as import growth in the European Union is slowing down and China’s imports are projected to stay below the large volumes in 2020 and 2021 which made the country the top-importer.(Figure 3.6). However, current policy discussion to ban imports of GMO maize may alter these projections (Box 3.1). The international trade volume of other coarse grains, dominated by barley and sorghum, is much smaller than for maize or wheat. Global exports are expected to remain stable compared to the base period level at 50 Mt in 2032. The top five exporters – the European Union, Australia, Russia, Canada and Argentina are projected to account for 78% of global trade by 2032, 3 percentage points above the volume in the base period and mainly driven by export increases in Russia. The five major importers – China, Saudi Arabia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Türkiye, and the United States – absorb almost 67% of global trade, with China expected to account for 40% by 2032. As it is assumed that maize production in China will increase more significantly than in the past decade, the net-feed deficit will decrease over the medium term. However maize imports are assumed reach 19 Mt through by the end of the projection period, well above the WTO agreed TRQ level, while imports of sorghum and barley are as well projected to increase to 19 Mt. As during the past decade, rice trade is projected to grow at 1.9% p.a. over the next ten years, with overall export volumes rising by 12 Mt to reach 63 Mt by 2032. The export share of the top five major rice exporters – India, Thailand, Viet Nam, Pakistan, and the United States – is expected to increase from 77% to 81%. India is projected to remain the world’s leading supplier of rice, while ongoing changes in the varietal make up of production and the increased focus on cultivating higher quality strains could help Viet Nam expand its market share in regions other than Asia. Thailand is projected to remain the second largest rice exporter but is to continue facing strong competition for markets. Less developed countries in Asia, particularly Cambodia and Myanmar, are projected to register strong export expansion, with their rice shipments collectively increasing by 29% from 4.0 Mt in the base period to 5.2 Mt by 2032, amid expectations that large exportable supplies will allow these countries to capture a greater share of Asian and African markets. Historically, Indica rice has accounted for the bulk of rice traded internationally. However, demand for other varieties is expected to continue to grow over the next decade. Imports by China, the largest importer of rice, are expected to drop from 5 Mt in the base period to 4 Mt in 2032, well below the peak in 2015. Imports are projected to increase significantly in African countries, where growth in demand continues to outpace production growth. Nigeria is projected to become the second largest importer of rice, increasing imports by 2.4 Mt to 4.0 Mt, or the equivalent of 38% of domestic consumption by 2032. Overall, imports by African countries are expected to increase from 18 Mt in the base period to 29 Mt by 2032, increasing Africa’s share of world imports from 34% to 45%. In addition to China and Nigeria, the group of five major importers in 2032 is projected to include the Philippines, the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which overall would account for 25% of global rice imports by 2032. 3.3.4. Prices Prices for cereals in real terms are expected to decline over the next decade The world wheat price averaged USD 319/t in the 2022 calendar year, the highest recorded in the past 20 years. Prices increased sharply when Russia’s war against Ukraine started in February and remained  153 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 high for several months mainly driven by the uncertainty about supplies to international markets. With increased seasonal supplies from harvests in the northern hemisphere and an agreement reached on the Black Sea Grain Initiative, prices started to fall before the agreement was signed in late July 2022. By early 2023 international wheat prices had fallen to their pre-war levels but remain elevated. Market prices for maize and barley have shown similar patterns since 2020 (Figure 3.7). Figure 3.7. Monthly prices for wheat, maize and barley Note: Wheat: US wheat, No.2 Hard Red Winter, fob Gulf; maize: US Maize, No.2 Yellow, fob Gulf; barley: France, feed barley, fob Rouen Source: Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA) Tool. StatLink 2https://stat.link/cwyfs4 Nominal wheat prices are expected to remain below the 2022 level but remain elevated for another season before returning to their medium-term trend. After dropping, the price is projected to increase to USD 293/t by 2032. For maize and other coarse grain prices it is also expected that they return to the medium-term path by 2025. Over the medium term the global maize price is expected to reach USD 226/t and the price for other coarse grains (measured by the feed barley price fob Rouen) is projected to reach USD 255/t (Figure 3.8). The reference export price for milled rice (FAO All Rice Price Index normalised to India 5%) moved within a narrow band of USD 387/t and USD 420/t between 2018 and 2022. In 2023, international rice prices are expected to increase, largely owing to tighter exportable supplies stemming from production contractions in some important exporters. Over the medium term, demand from countries in Far East, Africa, and the Middle East is expected to grow, but supply increases in exporters are expected to generate only a small increase in nominal prices to USD 459/t by 2032 Over the medium-term, prices for wheat, maize, other coarse grains and rice are expected to decline to 2032 when adjusted for inflation (real terms). 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 Jan FebMar Apr May Jun Jul AugSep Oct NovDec Jan FebMar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct NovDec Jan FebMar Apr May Jun Jul AugSep Oct NovDec Jan Feb 2020 2021 2022 2023 USD/t Wheat Maize Barley beginning of the war Black Sea Grain Initiative signed 154  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 3.8.

Risks and uncertainties A much more volatile market and policy environment in the next decade? More than most other commodities, grain markets have been and could continue to be markedly affected by the outcome of the Russia’s war against Ukraine given their strong participation in international markets, especially for wheat and maize, as well as fertilisers and fossil fuels. The production and export expectations for cereals from both countries, especially for Ukraine, would be lower than presented in this Outlook with a prolonged duration of the crisis. Moreover, with a continuing crisis, countries in East Africa and the NENA region that depended on cereal imports from the Black Sea region in the past have already started to find new sources of supply, but this process is not finished. The Black Sea Grain Initiative has eased the tense situation, but the extension of this deal is subject to many uncertainties. Rising fertiliser prices due to ongoing supply disruptions, the Russia’s war against Ukraine, and other factors may lead to decreased yields in the short term, particularly in low-income countries. The resulting increase in commodity prices could exacerbate an already potentially difficult international food security situation. Several other factors could impact on the cereals market that are not reflected in the current projections. While normal assumptions for weather lead to positive production prospects for the main grain-producing regions, extreme weather events accentuated by climate change may cause higher volatility in cereal yields, thereby affecting global supplies and prices. There are heightened risks in some regions of water scarcity constraining production. The policy environment will be crucial. The reinforcement of food security and the focus on increased sustainability in anticipated reforms (e.g. the Farm to Fork Strategy in the European Union) as well as policies favouring biofuels (Brazil and India) will heighten competition in the demand for cereals. China’s domestic policies, which are an increasing influence on domestic production and import demand, are also 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 2002 2007201220172022202720322002200720122017202220272032 Nominal price Real price USD/t Rice Wheat Other coarse grains Maize  155 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 crucial for future developments in cereal markets. Trade restrictions could provoke market reactions and changes in trade flows such as the past export measures applied to grains and rice. Relaxing policies related to GMO and gene editing could have a significant impact on the potential for cereal production globally, as could the speed of adoption of available conventional technologies and improved farm practices. These policy changes could also go in the opposite direction if countries become more GMO\u0002unfriendly (Box 3.1). Crop pests and animal diseases are a continuing risk that could disrupt markets. On the supply side, this is the case in regions with limited resources to mitigate the impacts of such events. Examples are the recent locust and fall army worm outbreaks, which have undermined food security in several Asian and African countries. Animal diseases could reduce feed demand, as seen recently with the effects of the African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreak in SE Asia. Box 3.1. Mexico’s National Development Plan In December 2020, the Mexican Government issued a decree with the aim of eliminating the use of glyphosate and GMO maize by the year 2024 in order to meet objectives set out by the National Development Plan (Plan de Desarrollo Nacional). This decree was revised in February 2023 to meet the requirements of the USMCA free trade agreement, allowing the use of GMO crops in the feed and industry sectors, but prohibiting their use for human consumption, such as in maize flour and tortillas. The Mexican Government also launched the programme “Sembrando Vida” in an effort to foster food self\u0002sufficiency and alleviate rural poverty and environmental degradation in specific areas. Additionally, the government is attempting to reduce dependence on global grains markets, particularly maize, which represented 17% of the total value of agricultural imports in 2021. In 2022, Mexico was the sixth largest maize producer globally, producing 27 Mt, yet it has been among the largest maize importers for years, importing 17 Mt in 2022. Production has increased by an average of 1.8% per year over the past decade, matching food demand at 1.28% per year, but imports have grown even faster, at 8.5% p.a., due to the surge in demand for feed, which has increased by almost double in the last decade. The majority of Mexico's maize imports come from the United States and are mainly GMO yellow maize. In Mexico, maize production is not limited to certain regions like it is in many other large maize-producing countries; instead, it is spread across the entire country and covers different agroecological zones. As a result, 62% of the total maize production is from federal states with yields below the national average. The southern region, which makes up around half of Mexico's total maize production area, has below-average incomes and lacks infrastructure compared to more developed regions such as the centre and north. To address this discrepancy, the National Development Plan 2019-2024 aims to close the gap between the wealthy and poorer regions in the country, including the difference in income and productivity among farmers in the south. The following scenario has been conducted with the Aglink-Cosimo model which assumes an increase in the average yield in Mexico of 23% with respect to the baseline value. Rather than assuming an immediate increase, this ambitious target is assumed to be gradually met by 2032 (Figure 3.9). This estimate was calculated by identifying the states included in the “Sembrando Vida” programme in which maize yields are below the country average and then increasing their yield to the country average yield in 20201 according to “Sistema de Información Agralimentaria y Pesquera” (SIAP) data in Mexico.2 156  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 3.9.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/8ekbmj The scenario results imply that if yields are improved this way, maize production in Mexico could be raised by 10.5 Mt, with imports decreasing by about the same amount. Despite this, Mexico will still be a net importer at 12.5 Mt. To become self-sufficient also for feed markets, yields need to be increased even further. The expected lower Mexican maize imports would decrease United States maize production by 2.7 Mt or -0.7%, compared to the baseline in 2032. Nevertheless, the decline in United States maize exports is smaller compared to the decline in Mexican imports. Global maize prices would be 2.5% lower than in the baseline. This analysis assumes that yield improvement is attainable. Technically, it is feasible to reach such yields; experiments conducted by the Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo (CIMMYT) in Chiapas, Mexico ‒ a state with one of the lowest maize yields ‒ showed that with adequate agronomic practices, yields could reach approximately 4 t/ha3, close to the target yield assumed in this scenario. Nonetheless, the discussion and analysis on the efforts required to achieve such a goal are beyond the scope of this scenario.

Projections cover consumption, production, trade and prices for soybean, other oilseeds, protein meal, and vegetable oil. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key risks and uncertainties which could have implications for world oilseed markets over the next decade. 4 Oilseeds and oilseed products  159 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 4.1. Projection highlights Continued demand for vegetable oil will drive oilseed markets Food use of vegetable oils should account for 57% of total consumption in 2032, driven by population growth and increased per capita use of vegetable oil in lower – and middle-income countries. The vegetable oil aggregate in this Outlook includes oil obtained from the crushing of oilseeds (about 55% of world vegetable oil production) and palm oil (36%), as well as palm kernel, coconut, and cottonseed oils. The use of vegetable oil for biodiesel, currently about 16% of global vegetable oil use, is projected to grow globally, especially in emerging markets like Indonesia and Brazil and in the United States, while declining use in the European Union, still the largest producer of biodiesel. Protein meal utilisation will be constrained by slower growth in global poultry and livestock production, especially in high-income countries, as it is almost entirely used as animal feed. Soybean meal accounts for about three-quarters of the global protein meal sector (Figure 4.1). Demand growth in the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”) is expected to slow down considerably, driven by improved feed efficiency combined with efforts to achieve lower protein meal shares in livestock feed rations. In the European Union, the second-largest user of protein meal, consumption is expected to decline as growth in animal production slows and other protein sources are increasingly used in feed. By contrast, in Southeast Asia increasing animal production is projected to raise demand for imports of protein meal. Figure 4.1. Protein meal and vegetable oil production by type Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/szk0yg In view of a slowdown in the expansion of the mature oil palm area, palm oil production growth in Indonesia and Malaysia is projected to be limited. Assuming increased replanting and increased mechanisation, a slight recovery in palm oil yields is expected over the outlook period. Palm oil production in other tropical countries is expected to expand more strongly, but Indonesia and Malaysia are still projected to account for 81% of global palm oil production. Soybean production is expected to be dominated by yield improvements accounting for about three\u0002quarters of the global growth while the expansion of harvested area, including increased double-cropping in Latin America, accounts for the remaining quarter. Soybean production is expected to reach 415 Mt by 2032, more than double the combined output of other oilseeds at 189 Mt.

Production of other oilseeds is projected to increase at a slower rate compared to the last decade, due to increasing competition by cereals for limited arable land in China and the European Union as well as stagnating demand for rapeseed oil as a feedstock in European biodiesel production. In general, the cultivation of other oilseeds such as rapeseed and sunflower seed is much less concentrated than that of soybeans. China, the European Union, Canada, and Ukraine each produce between 16 Mt to 36 Mt of these oilseeds. However, Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing disruptions in sunflower seed production, processing and trade. The world’s leading suppliers of palm oil, Indonesia and Malaysia, will continue to dominate the vegetable oil trade, exporting more than 60% of their combined production and jointly accounting for nearly 60% of global vegetable oil exports. India, the world’s biggest importer of vegetable oil, is projected to maintain its high import growth to satisfy growing domestic demand. Due to declining use for biodiesel production, imports of vegetable oil by the European Union are expected to decline strongly. Growth in world exports of soybeans, another product with a high trade share dominated by the Americas, is expected to slow considerably over the next decade due to the projected slower growth in soybean import demand by China. While in the 2021 marketing year prices in the oilseed sector were at record highs, the current downward adjustment is expected to continue during the first years of the outlook period. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase slightly in nominal terms, while declining in real terms for oilseeds and protein meal following the long-term trend of agricultural commodity prices. Prices of vegetable oil could increase in real terms due to continued strong demand growth and limited potential for production expansion. The use of vegetable oil as biodiesel feedstock is mostly determined by biofuel policies, which include countries’ mandated blending ratios. In particular, the use by some countries of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) holds potential and could result in strong demand growth for vegetable oil. The future demand for protein meal in China depends on the balance between feed intensity and efficiency especially in rebuilding the pig meat sector, following African Swine Fever (ASF) as from 2018. The scope to increase palm oil output in Indonesia and Malaysia will increasingly depend on oil palm replanting activities and accompanying yield improvements (rather than area expansion), creating new challenges as yields of palm oil have been stagnant for several years. Sustainability concerns (i.e. deforestation and the use of sustainability certifications for vegetable oil) and concerns about the high saturated fat content of palm oil also influence the consumer acceptance and demand for palm oil. 4.2. Current market trends Nominal prices are high but declining from record levels International prices for oilseeds fell from record high levels observed in 2022 but remained above the average level of recent years in early 2023, mainly reflecting fluctuating prices for soybeans, sunflower seeds, and rapeseed. Meanwhile, world vegetable oil prices continued declining from record highs observed in early 2022, driven by lower world prices of palm, soy, sunflower seed and rapeseed oils. Concerning oil meals, international soymeal quotations rebounded in recent months, primarily underpinned by prospects of deteriorating production and crushing in Argentina. Global soybean production in 2022/23 was lower than initially expected, largely tied to protracted dry conditions in Argentina, while harvest expectations in Brazil remain positive due to favourable weather conditions in most of the growing regions. In Indonesia, palm oil production is expected to increase in 2023, despite recent excessive rainfall in some areas that impeded the harvesting activities. In February, the Indonesian Government imposed temporary exports limits on palm oil, in order to secure enough domestic  161 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 cooking oil. In Malaysia, palm oil production is also growing, thanks to generally conducive weather as well as to the gradual improvement of lingering labour shortages issues. There are many uncertainties that can influence the market in the coming months, such as adverse climatic conditions, changes in policies, and the evolution of the Russia’s war against Ukraine. 4.3. Market projections 4.3.1. Vegetable oil consumption Demand for vegetable oil for food is slowing down The two dominant uses of vegetable oil are for human consumption (57%) and a feedstock for the production of biodiesel (16%). In addition, vegetable oils are also used for cosmetics, varnishes, and increasingly in animal feed, especially for aquaculture. Per capita consumption of vegetable oil for food is projected to grow by 0.1% p.a., considerably less than the 0.8% p.a. increase observed during 2013-22 due to declining food demand in high-income countries. In emerging markets such as China (27 kg/capita) and Brazil (23 kg/capita), the consumption of vegetable oil for food is set to reach levels comparable to those of wealthier economies (Figure 4.2). India, the world’s second largest consumer and main importer of vegetable oil, is projected to sustain a per capita consumption growth of 1% p.a., reaching almost 11 kg/capita by 2032. This substantial increase will be the result of both increases in its domestic production, crushing of increased domestic oilseed production, and imports of mainly palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia. As urbanisation increases in low\u0002income countries, dietary habits and traditional meal patterns are expected to shift towards processed foods that have a high content of vegetable oil. For least developed countries (LDCs), the per capita availability of vegetable oil is projected to increase by 1.2% p.a., to reach 8 kg per capita by 2032 due to higher incomes. Figure 4.2.

The use of vegetable oil as feedstock for biodiesel depends on the policy setting (Chapter 9) and the relative price development of vegetable oil and crude oil (see below). In general, national targets for mandatory biodiesel consumption are expected to increase less than in previous years. In addition, used oils, tallow, and other feedstocks are increasing their share in the production of biodiesel, especially in the European Union, largely due to specific policies. In the United States, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) or Renewable Diesel is considered an advanced biofuel and is expected to drive the considerable growth of biodiesel production. In Indonesia, the growth in the use of vegetable oil to produce biodiesel is projected to remain strong and reach 10.1 Mt by 2032 due to supportive domestic policies. Figure 4.3. Share of vegetable oil used for biodiesel production Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/la6h5j 4.3.2. Protein meal consumption Feed demand is slowing, shaped by developments in China Protein meal is exclusively used as feed and its consumption is projected to continue to grow at 0.9% p.a., considerably below that of the last decade (2.9% p.a.). The link between feed use of protein meal and animal production is related to the intensification of animal production, which increases demand for protein meal, whereas feeding efficiencies lead to a reduction of protein feed per animal. Moreover, the composition of animal husbandry and herd sizes are additional factors. The link between animal production and protein meal consumption is associated with a country’s level of economic development (Figure 4.4). Lower income countries, which rely on backyard production, consume less protein meal, whereas higher income economies which employ intensive production systems use higher amounts of protein meal. Because of a shift to more feed-intensive production systems in developing countries in response to rapid urbanisation and increasing demand for animal products, growth in protein meal consumption tends to exceed growth in animal production. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 World United States Indonesia Thailand European Union Brazil Argentina % 2010-12 2020-22 2032  163 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 4.4.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0ipkmb In LDCs, where the use of protein meals is very low, intensification in livestock production with growing use of compound feed is expected to continue. Nevertheless, due to strong growth of animal production, average use of protein meal per animal output continues to decline. China accounts for more than a quarter of global protein meal demand and is therefore shaping global demand. Growth in China’s demand for compound feed is expected to be slower than in the previous decade due to declining growth rates for animal production and the existing large share of compound feed\u0002based production. The protein meal content in China’s compound feed is expected to remain stable after it surged in the last decade but continues to exceed current levels in the United States and European Union. In the European Union, and the United States, protein meal consumption is expected to grow at a slower rate than animal production due to improving feeding efficiencies. In addition, animal products, primarily poultry and dairy, are increasingly marketed in the European Union as produced without feed use from genetically modified crops, driven by large retail chains that results in lower demand for soybean meal. 4.3.3. Oilseed crush and production of vegetable oils and protein meal Slowing global oilseed crush and limited growth in palm oil production Globally, the crushing of soybeans and other oilseeds into meal (cake) and oil accounts for about 90% of total usage. The demand for crush will increase faster than demand for other uses, notably direct food consumption of soybeans (including for meat and dairy replacements), groundnuts and sunflower seeds, as well as direct feeding of soybeans. The crush location depends on transport costs, trade policies (e.g. different tariffs for oilseeds and products), acceptance of genetically modified crops, processing costs (e.g. labour and energy), and infrastructure (e.g. crushing facilities, ports and roads). Soybean crush is projected to expand by 44 Mt over the Outlook period, significantly less than the 75 Mt in the previous decade. Chinese soybean crush is projected to increase by 9 Mt, accounting for about 21% of the world’s additional crush, the bulk of which will utilise imported soybeans. The growth in China, although large, is projected to be considerably lower than in the previous decade.

Global protein meal output from oilseed crush is projected to increase by 0.9% p.a., reaching 405 Mt by 2032. World production of protein meals is dominated by soybean meal, which accounts for more than two-thirds of world protein meal production. Production is concentrated in a small group of countries (Figure 4.5). In China and the European Union, most protein meal production comes from the crushing of imported oilseeds, primarily soybeans from Brazil and the United States. In the other important producing countries ‒ Argentina, Brazil, India, and the United States ‒ domestically-produced soybeans and other oilseeds dominate. Figure 4.5. Oilseed crush by country or region Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/10utq5 Global vegetable oil production depends on both the crush of oilseeds and the production of perennial tropical oil plants, especially palm oil. Global palm oil output has outpaced the production of other vegetable oils over the past decade. However, growth in production is expected to weaken due to increasing sustainability concerns and the aging of oil palm trees in Indonesia and Malaysia, which account for almost one-third of the world’s vegetable oil production and for more than 80% of global palm oil production. At the global level, palm oil supplies are projected to expand at an annual rate of 0.8%. Increasingly stringent environmental policies from the major importers of palm oil and sustainable agricultural norms (e.g. in line with the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development) are expected to slow the expansion of the oil palm area in Indonesia and Malaysia. This implies that growth in production comes increasingly from productivity improvements, including an acceleration of replanting. Palm oil production in other countries is expected to expand more rapidly from a low base, mainly for domestic and regional markets. For example, Thailand is projected to produce 3.5 Mt by 2032, Colombia 2.6 Mt, and Nigeria 1.7 Mt. In several Central American countries, niche palm oil production is developing with global sustainability certifications in place from the outset, positioning the region to eventually reach broader export markets. The vegetable oil complex includes palm kernel, coconut and cottonseed oil, as well as palm oil and oil extracted from the crush of oilseeds as noted above.

Palm kernel oil and coconut oil have important industrial uses, now dominated by palm kernel oil with a bye-product of the growing production of palm oil. Cottonseed oil is a by-product of cotton ginning (Chapter 10), with global production concentrated largely in India, the United States, Pakistan, and China. Overall, vegetable oil production is projected to increase globally by 0.9% p.a., driven mainly by food demand in low- and middle-income countries resulting from population and income growth. 4.3.4. Oilseed production Soybean production shifts to Latin America while palm oil and rapeseed yield growth is sluggish The production of soybeans is projected to grow by 0.9% p.a., compared to 2.2% p.a. over the last decade. Growth will be dominated by yield increases, accounting for almost three-quarters of production growth. Soybeans benefit from their fast growth, which allows for double cropping, especially in Latin America. Consequently, a considerable share of additional harvested area increase will result from double-cropping soybeans following maize in Brazil and wheat in Argentina. Brazil has in recent years been the largest producer of soybeans and is expected to grow at 0.8% p.a. over the next decade – slightly stronger than the United States, the second largest producer, at 0.6% p.a., due to double cropping with maize. The production of soybeans is projected to grow strongly elsewhere in Latin America, with Argentina and Paraguay producing 51 Mt and 12 Mt, respectively, by 2032 (Figure 4.6). In China, soybean production is expected to continue to increase in response to reduced policy support for the cultivation of cereals, but at slower pace than the previous decade. Soybean production is also expected to increase in India, the Russian Federation (hereafter “Russia”), Ukraine, and Canada. Figure 4.6.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/26ek0m The production of other oilseeds (rapeseed, sunflower seed, and groundnuts) will also grow at a slower pace, at 0.9% p.a. compared to 2.6% p.a. over the previous ten years (2013-2022). China (a major producer of rapeseed and groundnuts) and the European Union (which mainly produces rapeseed and sunflower seeds) are the most important producers of other oilseeds, with a projected annual output of 40 Mt and 30 Mt, respectively, by 2032. However, limited growth in output is projected for both regions (0.8% p.a. for China and 1.0% p.a. for the European Union) as relatively higher prices for cereals are 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2010-12 2020-22 2032 2010-12 2020-22 2032 Soybean Other oilseeds Mt Latin America and the Caribbean North America Europe and Central Asia Asia Pacific Sub-Saharan Africa NENA 166  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 expected to generate strong competition for limited arable land. Canada, another major producer and the largest exporter of rapeseed, is projected to increase its production of other oilseeds by 1.2% p.a., to reach 20 Mt by 2032. Decomposing production between the contribution of yield and area shows that yields for major producers of palm oil and for some major suppliers of rapeseed have fallen or grown slowly during the last decade (Figure 4.7). There are many reasons for this development; 1) a strong increase in production area so that less favourable land is used for production reducing average yields; 2) the ageing of oil palms as well as labour shortages has reduced yields; 3) restrictions in the use of pesticides adversely affected average rapeseed yields in the European Union; and 4) shifting weather patterns adversely affected yields. It remains uncertain how this will play out over the coming decade, but lower area expansion could result in a recovery in yields over the Outlook period. If this is not the case it will be a challenge to satisfy growing demand, especially for vegetable oil. Soybean stocks are projected to reach a stock-to-use ratio of almost 12% by 2032, which remains low compared to the past two decades, so harvest failures could quickly lead to market shortages.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0528b7 4.3.5. Trade Trade is significant for oilseeds and products, but slowing down Over 40% of world soybean production is traded internationally, a high share compared to other agricultural commodities. The expansion in world soybean trade is directly linked to projected slower growth of the soybean crush in China and Chinese imports are projected to grow by 0.7% p.a. to about 102 Mt by 2032 (down from 4.0% p.a. in 2013-2022), accounting for about 60% of world soybean imports. Exports of soybeans originate predominately from Brazil and the United States. Whereas the United States was historically the largest global exporter of soybeans, Brazil has now taken over with steady growth in its export capacity and is projected to account for 53% of total global exports of soybean by 2032. For other oilseeds, the internationally traded share of global production remains much lower at about 14% of world production as the two largest producers, China and the European Union, are net-importers. The main exporters are Canada, Australia, and Ukraine, which are projected to account for 70% of world exports by 2032.

Additional oilseed production is crushed domestically and exported in the form of vegetable oil or protein meal. Figure 4.8.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/30hmki Vegetable oil exports, which amount to 38% of global vegetable oil production, continue to be dominated by a few players. Indonesia and Malaysia are expected to continue to account for almost 60% of total vegetable oil exports during the Outlook period (Figure 4.9). However, the share of exports in production is projected to contract slightly in these countries as domestic demand for food, oleochemicals, and, especially, biodiesel uses is expected to grow. India is projected to continue its strong growth in imports at 1.5% p.a., reaching 18 Mt by 2032, to meet increasing demand driven by population growth, urbanisation, and rising disposable income. The projected growth in world trade of protein meal is 0.9% p.a. over the Outlook period and Argentina is expected to remain by far the largest meal exporter with its clear export orientation. The largest importer is the European Union, with imports expected to decline due to reduced domestic demand for protein meal. More than three-quarters of the global import growth in protein meal is projected to occur in Asia, in particular in Southeast Asia with its increasing animal production. As the domestic crushing capacity in Asian countries is not expected to keep pace with protein meal demand, expansion of the livestock sector is expected to require imported feed. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 United States Brazil Argentina Canada Australia Ukraine Argentina Brazil United States Indonesia Malaysia Argentina Soybean Other oilseeds Protein meals Vegetable oils % 2020-22 2032 168  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 4.9.

Prices Current high prices will weaken over the next decade A downward adjustment is expected during the first years of the Outlook period, reflecting expectations of better production prospects, partly fueled by the incentive of current high prices. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase slightly in nominal terms, while declining in real terms following the long-term trend of agricultural commodity prices (Figure 4.10). Due to expected stronger demand for vegetable oil than protein meal, prices of vegetable oil are projected to rise compared to protein meal. This will also favour other oilseeds prices over soybeans as they contain higher shares of vegetable oil. Figure 4.10. Evolution of world oilseed prices Note: Soybeans, US, c.i.f.

Risks and uncertainties Environmental concerns will influence global oilseed supply chains The scope for increasing palm oil output in Indonesia and especially in Malaysia will increasingly depend on replanting and yield improvements rather than new area expansion. In recent years, growth in production has been sluggish given the low profitability of the sector and rising labour costs in Malaysia. There has been some replanting progress by major palm oil companies in Indonesia. In addition to the slowdown in yields, sustainability concerns will also influence the expansion of palm oil output as demand in developed countries favours deforestation-free oils and seeks sustainability certification for vegetable oil used as biodiesel feedstock and, increasingly, for vegetable oils entering the food chain. However, there are concerns with competing certification schemes in Malaysia and Indonesia. Other consumer concerns regarding soybeans stem from the high share of production derived from genetically modified seeds. In the European Union in particular, retailer certification schemes of animal products based on feed free of genetically modified products are gaining momentum and may shift feed demand to other protein sources than soybean meal. This may further reduce protein meal demand as the European Union accounted for 13% of global demand in 2020-22. Heightened environmental concerns are especially related to a potential link between deforestation and increasing soybean production in Brazil and Argentina. These concerns have motivated the private sector to incentivise the use of land already cleared for further area expansion to avoid further deforestation. If successful, these voluntary initiatives should discourage clearing of land by soybean producers. Biofuel policies in the United States, the European Union, and Indonesia remain a major source of uncertainty in the vegetable oil sector given that about 16% of global vegetable oil supplies go to biodiesel production. In Indonesia, attaining the recently proposed 30% biodiesel mandate is questionable as – in addition to requiring government subsidies – they may impose medium-term supply constraints. In the United States Renewable Diesel or HVO receive considerable support in some states that show strong production growth rates. In the European Union, policy reforms and the emergence of second-generation biofuel technologies will likely prompt a shift away from crop-based feedstocks. Globally, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are expected to be a substantial use of biofuels but the timing of introduction remains largely uncertain. The development of crude oil prices, which affects the competitivity and profitability of biodiesel production, remains a major source of uncertainty. China’s import demand for soybean remains uncertain and many factors influence it. Overall, the development of the meat demand is shaped by declining population, slower but still substantial economic growth which will be the main determinant of feed and especially protein meal demand. The pig meat industry recovery from ASF combined with its restructuring will have a large influence on feed demand, especially for protein meal for feeding. Protein meals compete in part with other feed components in the production of compound feed and are thus reacting to any change in cereal prices. Any adjustment of feed mixtures will influence protein meal use. Russia’s war against Ukraine poses large uncertainty around the sunflower complex as both countries are the largest producers of sunflower seed (each accounting for more than a quarter of global production) and exporters of sunflower products. Especially, Ukraine is also an important regional exporter of rapeseed and soybeans. Thus, any production shortfall reduces available oilseeds and products on the global market while also leading to a shortfall of vegetable oil and protein meal for feed in Ukraine. 170  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 This chapter describes market developments and medium-term projections for world sugar markets for the period 2023-32. Projections cover consumption, production, trade and prices for sugar beet, sugar cane, sugar, molasses, and high-fructose corn syrup. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key risks and uncertainties which could have implications for world sugar markets over the next decade. 5 Sugar  171 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 5.1. Projection highlights Over the next decade, world per-capita sugar consumption is projected to increase, mainly spurred by income growth in low and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa. The overall rise in sugar intake is expected to be mitigated by a modest decline in per capita consumption in high-income countries, reflecting rising health concerns among consumers, and measures implemented at country level to discourage sugar consumption. Despite the diverging trend, however, average per-capita consumption in low- and middle\u0002income countries, notably in Sub-Sahara Africa, is anticipated to remain substantially lower than in high\u0002income countries. Sugar is projected to remain the most consumed caloric sweetener still accounting for 80% of the global sweetener utilization despite general efforts to find substitutes. The main alternative caloric sweetener, High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), is anticipated to, at best, maintain its share at around 8% of total consumption, while the remaining balance is accounted for by low-caloric High Intensive Sweeteners (HIS), including saccharin, sucralose and aspartame.1 Over the outlook period, sugar production is expected to expand mainly in key sugarcane producing countries. Sugarcane, which grows mostly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, will continue to account for more than 85% of the aggregate sugar crops output. Brazilian production is expected to increase as a result of both area expansion and yield improvements, driven by remunerative prices. Productivity gains, including varietal improvements and higher extraction rates, will drive sugar production growth in India and Thailand, with acreage projected to remain relatively stable. In Africa, sugarcane production in the key producer, South Africa, is anticipated to expand on account of government support measures to the sector. Production of sugar beet, which grows mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, is foreseen to remain quite stable in the European Union, while increasing in Egypt, boosted by rising regional and industrial demand. The increase in sugar beet production in Egypt is projected to consolidate its position as the continent’s largest sugar producer by 2032. Over the next decade, the supply of sugar will continue to be tempered by the use of sugar crops as a feedstock for ethanol. In Brazil, the ambitions of the Renovabio program encourage ethanol production and sugarcane will remain the main feedstuff for reaching the 2030 target. Constant real international crude oil prices will favour sugarcane-based ethanol production, while Brazilian sugar production will remain competitive in international markets, even if the Real is assumed to appreciate in real terms. Brazilian processors, who can easily switch between sugar or ethanol from sugarcane, will continue to arbitrate according to the relative profitability of the two products; over the next ten years, ethanol is projected to become more attractive relative to sugar. In some other countries, implementation of policies promoting the development of biofuels will also add some pressure to the availability of sugarcane for sugar production, especially in India, with the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme aimed at reaching a blending rate of 20% of ethanol in petrol (E20) by 2025/26. In 2032, Brazil and India are foreseen to account for about 23% (45 Mt) and 19% (38 Mt) of the world's total sugar output respectively. Better growth prospects are expected in Brazil, supported by profitable sales on the international market while in India, despite an increase in the extraction rate, the increase is projected lower given the diversion of sugarcane to ethanol production. Elsewhere, the largest significant increase in production, in absolute terms compared to the base period, is anticipated in Thailand (+ 5 Mt). 172  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 5.1. Sugar production and trade, by region Note: data are expressed on a tel quel basis (tq) Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/wqnd8e International trade will continue to grow, mainly reflecting expanding demand from deficit regions in low\u0002and middle-income economies. Exports are anticipated to increase over the decade with shipments representing about 38% of global sugar production in 2032, up from 36% in the base period. Exports will continue to originate in a few countries, mainly in Brazil (46% of world trade), followed by Thailand and India. Imports are anticipated to remain less concentrated with the main increases projected in Asia and Africa, while the strongest declines in imports are foreseen in the United States, Russia and Japan, reflecting higher domestic production and a contraction in domestic demand for the latter. While the bulk of the sugar marketed worldwide will continue to be in the form of raw sugar from sugarcane, the share of white (refined) sugar from sugar cane and sugar beet is seen increasing moderately. International sugar prices in real terms are foreseen to fall from the current high levels amid an improvement in global export availabilities and to decline during the projection period from productivity gains. The downward pressure on prices is expected to be partially offset by constant real international crude oil prices, encouraging the use of sugar crops for ethanol production. The white sugar premium (difference between white and raw sugar prices), which was particularly high (on average USD 101/t during the base period) due to tightness on the white sugar market, is anticipated to slightly increase in nominal terms over the outlook period, with the share of white sugar imports in total trade growing by 2032. The dynamics of the sugar markets as presented in this Outlook are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including developments in the global macroeconomic context and implementation of new sugar-related policies. In addition, weather conditions, profitability of sugar vis-à-vis ethanol, and competition with other crops are sources of production uncertainty. On the demand side, developments in the global economy that affect consumers’ purchasing power, consumers’ preferences and inflation levels are key factors that could alter the consumption patterns presented in this Outlook. 5.2. Current market trends After reaching a 16-month low in October 2022, international sugar prices rebounded sharply later in the year and in early 2023, mainly reflecting prevailing overall tight global sugar supplies amid strong global import demand.

Sugar production is forecast to decline in India and in the European Union, due to lower sugar beet plantings and yields. However, overall, world sugar production in the 2022/23 season is anticipated to increase from last year, on expectations of a significant recovery in Brazil’s production, the world’s largest sugar producer and exporter, and a larger crop in Thailand. On the demand side, world sugar consumption is seen increasing for a third successive season in 2022/23. However, the growth of global sugar consumption is anticipated to be moderate due to the projected deceleration in global economic growth in 2022/2023. The slower increase in consumption, compared to production, is expected to push the sugar market into a global surplus in 2022/23. Because of larger exportable availabilities, particularly from Brazil and Thailand, world sugar trade is predicted to expand compared to the previous season, which should match an anticipated higher global import demand in 2022/23, with the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”) and Indonesia continuing as the largest buyers of sugar, mainly in raw form for industrial use. 5.3. Market projections 5.3.1. Consumption Over the next ten years, global sugar consumption is projected to continue growing at around 1.1% p.a., reaching 193 Mt by 2032, driven by population and income growth. After experiencing a decline at the end of the 2010s, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, world average per capita consumption is now expected to rebound and reach 22.5 kg/capita in 2032. In general, sugar consumption over the next decade is projected to grow mainly where the level of per capita intake is currently low as, in all its forms, it represents a key source of energy in human diet. An opposite trend is foreseen where per capita consumption is high resulting in health concerns (risk of weight gain and tooth decay health). The WHO recommends reducing the daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of the total energy intake for health reasons. Development prospects are higher in Asia and Africa Asia and Africa will be the regions that will contribute most to additional global demand compared to the reference period, accounting for 67% and 32% of the world total, respectively. Urbanization, a growing middle class, and a young demographic are expected to be the key drivers of the increase in per capita consumption in these regions. Despite the projected increase, which adds to the continuous expansion of the past years, per capita consumption by 2032 is anticipated to remain below the global average in both Asia and Africa. In Asia, population and income growth as well as higher sugar-containing product consumption for industrial purposes, including sugar-rich confectionery products and soft drinks will drive sugar consumption. It is expected that India, followed by Indonesia and China, will provide the largest contribution to the overall increase in sugar consumption. In India and Indonesia, population growth, although slower than in the past decade, and income growth associated with stronger demand for processed food and beverage products is expected to sustain the increase in overall sugar consumption over the next decade. In China, consumption is emerging from a period of no real growth that started in 2016 with a period of high prices, followed by a three-year zero-Covid policy. With the reopening of the markets at the start of the projections, consumption is expected to rise again over the next ten years. Nevertheless, in terms of per capita consumption, it should remain well below the global average level in 2032 (12.6 kg/cap). Strong growth prospects are also expected in Least Developed Asian countries. Per capita consumption in Asia is expected to grow by 0.8% p.a. over the next decade compared with 0.3% in the last decade. In Africa, sustained population and income growth, are projected to drive the overall increase in sugar consumption, mainly on account of higher direct consumption in urban areas. Least Developed Sub- 174  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Saharan countries are foreseen to record the highest growth rate in per capita consumption across the region. In addition, with Least Developed Sub-Saharan countries expected to record the world’s highest population growth, sugar consumption growth in these countries is projected to be the strongest globally. By contrast, in South Africa, where sugar consumption has recorded significant declines in recent years amid government measures to discourage its use, per capita intake is projected to weaken further in the next decade. Over the coming decade, even if total daily carbohydrate intake in Asia and Africa will remain higher than in the rest of the world (particularly Northeast and North Africa), simple carbohydrates (glucose and fructose from sugar, high fructose sweeteners, fruits and vegetables and lactose) are expected to remain a small part of daily carbohydrate intake (Figure 5.2). In these two regions, in terms of carbohydrate intake, the increase in sugar consumption will not greatly affect the composition of the diet, as three-quarters of carbohydrate consumption is from staple foods. In rest of the world, the share of carbohydrates in daily intake should not change, except in North America, where a slight downward trend will be pronounced. Figure 5.2. Carbohydrate consumption per capita and by type, in the different regions Note: Staple foods include cereals, roots and tubers, and pulses.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/mfd4lw Downward trends will continue in other regions, high sugar consuming countries Traditionally, the Americas, the Caribbean and European countries record the highest level of per capita sugar consumption although caloric sweeteners represent a small part of carbohydrates in the diet. Since 2010 globally, in those countries, caloric sweetener consumption has trended down with adverse health effects being highlighted. Over the next decade, the decline is projected further, although at a slower pace. In Latin America, the world’s largest sugar supplier, high per capita consumption levels have raised concerns about the negative effects on health. Some countries during the last decade, including Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and more recently Colombia, have introduced a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages to try reducing soft drink intake. Measures to limit the sale and/or the promotion of sugary drinks or sweet products to children under 18 years were also taken, and some countries like Argentina have passed laws for mandatory front-of-package labelling with strict thresholds for healthier products.

Europe was the second most sugar-consuming region, although far behind Asia, among the seven regions presented in this Outlook. Over the next decade, while remaining the third most populated region, it is expected to give way to Africa followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. In Europe, for two decades countries have sought to take measures to avoid excessive consumption of sugar. Taxing sugar is among the measures implemented. Recently, Italy and Poland introduced a sugar tax, and it is currently being voted in the Russian Federation (hereafter “Russia”) (to be implemented 1 July 2023). The industry has also been looking for solutions to tackle the problem of obesity by reducing the amount of sugar in products or use artificial sweeteners as substitutes. Per capita sugar consumption in Europe is expected to see a continued decline, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous decade. In Ukraine, per capita consumption of sugar dropped markedly following the outbreak of the war in February 2022. However, sugar intake is projected to recover over the next decade and reach the levels prior the war by 2032. Among the other high sugar consuming countries, the level of consumption is projected to decline in Australia and New Zealand. This trend will also be visible in Canada and the United States. However, the United States shows the highest per capita consumption of caloric sweeteners which include HFCS (48.1 kg/capita during the base period) and over the projection period, caloric sweeteners are expected to decrease the most in favour of greater consumption of fruit and vegetables.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/rtxh2z The High Fructose Corn Syrup market will grow slowly High Fructose Corn Syrup, the other caloric sweetener, is used primarily in beverages as a substitute to sugar. Unlike sugar, it is a liquid product and therefore less easily traded. Global consumption will remain the domain of a limited group of countries with no real development. The leading producers, United States and Mexico, will remain the main consumers with respectively 13.7 kg and 9.2 kg per person in 2032. In the United States, since the mid-2000s, when it represented with sugar the two main caloric sweeteners in equal proportion, its share has decreased. This trend is expected to continue as the debate on the potential greater health hazard of HFCS over sugar is still ongoing.

As a result, and because the demand in HFCS will not change much, the United States is foreseen to record a production decline (-13%) when compared to the base period and reach 6 Mt by 2032. China, the world’s largest starch producer, is expected to see the biggest changes as its per capita caloric sweetener consumption is very low compared to the rest of the world. Since 2020, corn prices have increased, and this was passed on the cost of producing/consuming HFCS, leading to some substitution with sugar or some other alternative sweeteners in soft drinks (erythritol), depending on the profitability of products. Over the next decade, with more competitive corn prices, China HFCS production is projected to increase to meet some growth in domestic demand (2.8 kg/capita in 2032). No increase is foreseen in Japan and Korea with a consumption of about 6 kg/capita. In the European Union, HFCS will remain uncompetitive with sugar over the next decade, accounting for only 1.6 kg/capita in 2032. Market developments in the rest of the world will not be significant. Overall, 80% of the overall amount consumed will remain sugar and less than 8% HFCS, the leading alternative product. The rest will come from high-intensity (low-calorie) sweeteners which are not covered in the Outlook. 5.3.2. Production Assuming normal weather conditions, world sugar production is expected to slightly increase over the outlook period although high input costs and competition from other agricultural crops are likely to moderate the magnitude. Being a capital-intensive sector, remunerative domestic prices are foreseen to be high enough to support investments and developments, both in crops and in sugar factories. Sugarcane is the main sugar crop. It grows mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. As a perennial crop, the same plants can be harvested after 12 to 18 months for about five years as cane can be self\u0002propagated, although yields decline over time. Apart from sugar, sugarcane is also used as feedstock to produce ethanol (with a certain flexibility in Brazil). In addition to sugar and ethanol, sugarcane can produce molasses, a thick juice, and the residue from cane milling (bagasse, the fibre left after extracting the thick juice) is burned to supply energy (cogeneration feedstock for electricity). Conversely, sugar beet is an annual crop, more dependent on the variability of input costs. It is cultivated mostly in temperate zones; its thick juice is used for sugar or ethanol production; it has two derivative products: beet pulp which is used in animal feed and molasses. Moreover, molasses can be further processed to extract crystal sugar which generates molasses by-product again. Sugar crops are used to produce a wide range of products, including food (sugar), feed, bio-based products for industry (pharmaceuticals, plastics, textiles, and chemicals) and ethanol. Also, the by-product molasses from these two sugar crops can be further processed to produce sugar or ethanol. Over the next ten years, the profitability of the two main sub-products of the sugar crops, sugar and ethanol, are projected to expand slightly, which will result in an increase in sugar crop production. Sugarcane will maintain its position as major main sugar crop Sugarcane will continue to account for around 87% of sugar crops. Over the outlook period, global sugarcane production is projected to grow by 1% p.a. and reach 1 905 Mt by 2032, with Brazil, India and Thailand anticipated to contribute the most to the change in global output volume (+142 Mt, +31 Mt and +6 Mt respectively). This mainly reflects relative higher crop yields notably in India as well as, although from a lower base, in Argentina; while area expansion is mainly expected in Brazil (+1.6 Mha).  177 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 5.4.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/htfawu Brazil is the biggest sugarcane producing country, more than half of which is used to produce ethanol. Over the next ten years, the growth in demand as well as the expected profitability of the two products, sugar and ethanol, will encourage the sector to respond to market needs. Investments aimed at developing mechanisation and more sustainable production practices should make it possible, among other things, to reduce the effects of the drought encountered in recent years. Some area expansion is foreseen and the share of area cultivated with sugarcane in total arable land availability (12.8% during the base period) will increase to 14.4% in 2032, while little improvement in yields is foreseen due to drier climatic conditions compare to the past. In India, the growth in sugarcane production is projected to stem mostly from higher crop yields, as acreage is not expected to expand given competition from other agricultural crops. In Thailand, sugarcane production over the next decade is also expected to come mainly from higher yields. In recent years, lower returns compared to alternative crops, higher fertiliser prices and stricter government measures limiting burning practices during harvest and adverse weather conditions contributed to a decline in area, but over the next decade, area is therefore not projected to expand significantly. In China, for a couple of years, regional authorities will continue to support farmers and millers to modernize and maximize their yields. But with the end of the zero COVID policy at the start of the projections, only moderate growth is expected as rising input costs, competition for land with other crops and comparatively cheaper sugar imports will slow efforts and efficiency. Prospects are less robust for sugar beet, the other sugar crop, as it is sensitive to high input costs. Some improvement in yields will contribute to a slight increase in production. It is projected to reach 284 Mt by 2032, with slower annual growth rate (0.4% p.a.) than during the past decade (0.5% p.a.) (Figure 5.4). Compared to the base period, expansion is expected in Russia (+8.1 Mt, from a low base), Türkiye, Egypt, China, the United States and Ukraine. During the last decade, Egypt and China were contributing the most to the global increase in sugar beet. Global sugar beet area is expected to decline, because of higher fertiliser prices as well as energy prices (beet mills need to buy energy to be able to operate unlike cane mills which can operate from bagasse), which negatively impact profit margins. Only higher yields will help the crop to keep market share. This should notably be the case in the United States, where both sugar crops are cultivated in almost equal 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 Sugar beet Europe and Central Asia Sugar beet Rest of the world Sugarcane India Sugarcane Brazil Sugarcane Rest of the World For ethanol For sugar Mt 178  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 proportion, 55% of sugar continuing to be produced from sugar beet. In the European Union, production is projected to stagnate due notably to high input costs compare to other crops, and stricter environmental legislation;2yields are not expected to improve, and some farmers will turn to other crops. In Egypt, remunerative procurement prices are expected to boost plantings of sugar beet, while efforts are also being made for the adoption of improved seed varieties. Government efforts to boost domestic agricultural production are underway and are projected to contribute to the overall increase in sugar beet area and crop yields. If during the last decade, 81% of world sugar crops were used to produce sugar, this share is expected to decline to 76% by 2032 over the outlook period (72% in the case of sugarcane and 97% in the case of sugar beet), due to growing competition of sugar crops for ethanol production, because mills often easily have the option of switching to one or the other. Brazil will continue to be the main producer of sugar and sugarcane-based ethanol, producing 40% of the world's sugarcane by 2032. Its sugarcane will account for 23% of global sugar production and 76% of global sugarcane-based ethanol production (compared to 21% and 88% during the base period). Global sugar production is set to increase Global sugar production is expected to grow from 175 Mt during the base period to 198 Mt by 2032, 23% of which will be sourced in Brazil who is expected to meet the growing needs of the international market, especially in the second half of the decade. Asia will remain the leading producing region producing about 42% of the world global output. Thailand is foreseen to provide the largest share of the sugar supply to the world market after Brazil, increasing its sugar production by +5 Mt by 2032 compared to the base period. The production increase is in line with higher sugarcane production and with sugar extraction rates projected to remain at the high level of the past few years. In India, the world’s second largest sugar producer, the growth rate in sugar production is expected to be lower than in the past decade, reflecting a slower growth in sugarcane production and greater diversion to ethanol.

Recovering from a long financial crisis and episode of drought, higher investments are expected in the sector. Considering the profitability of international sugar markets, sugar production is expected to increase by 5.2 Mt over the next decade. Africa is expected to improve its share in the global market mainly on account of Sub-Saharan African countries, where government support measures and foreign investments are expected to contribute to the increase in sugar production over the next years. In addition, suitable conditions for growing sugarcane, including potential for area expansion and lower costs of production, are expected to favour the increase in production. Compared to the base period, production in OECD countries is foreseen to account for less than 10% of the global increase. In 2032, the region will represent 21.2% of the global market, compared to 22.7% in the base period. Although it will retain its position as the main producer of this regional market (37%), the European Union's sugar production is expected to stabilize. The higher sugar supply increase, when compared to the base period, is foreseen in the United States (+0.7 Mt) as production will continue to benefit from several government policies that support the domestic industry including the Sugar Loan Program that supports prices paid to farmers; the Sugar Marketing Allotments that aim for domestic production to cover up to 85% of domestic consumption; the Feedstock Flexibility Program that diverts any sugar surplus to ethanol production, rather than sugar loan forfeitures to the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation; and trade barriers that limit imports to meet domestic needs (through tariff rate quotas, regional agreements, and the Suspension Agreements on Sugar with Mexico). 5.3.3. Trade Sugar remains heavily traded over the outlook period Sugar will remain a highly traded product. Most of it will continue to be raw sugar (60%). However, the share of white sugar imports that includes a premium will increase relatively more (Figure 5.6). Imports are foreseen to account for 37% of global consumption in 2032 with Asia and Africa remaining net\u0002importing regions. However, in Africa, efforts to boost domestic production capacities will reduce its share of dependence on imports, which will still represent 72% of consumption in 2032. The growth in consumption in Least Developed Sub-Saharan countries is expected to drive an increase in the share of imported white sugar for direct consumption. In Asia no significant changes are expected in terms of dependence: imports will continue to represent 42% of consumption and the share of imported raw sugar for industrial use will continue to increase, mainly driven by key buyers, China and Indonesia. By 2032, Africa and Asia will account respectively for 28% and 59% of global imports. In the past decade, South and Southeast Asia, Europe and Near East and North Africa regions were the major importing regions. Over the next decade, with the end of the zero Covid policy and a strong growth in consumption, South and Southeast Asia is projected to take the position as the leading sugar importing region by 2032, with Indonesia the world's largest importer. Strong growth is also foreseen for Near East and North Africa region as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa, although from a lower base. 180  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 5.6.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/j2e3t9 Over the coming decade, sugar imports are expected to continue to decline mainly in the United-States, and the Russian Federation due to improving supply prospects while in Japan, this will be due to reduced population. The United States is traditionally a sugar-deficit country where national policies will continue to foster domestic production and limit imports. Tariff rate quota (TRQ) allocations under WTO or free trade agreements (FTAs), as well as limited imports from Mexico due to the US Export Limit (set by the US Department of Commerce) will govern import flows. Given the relatively higher sugar prices in the United States, Mexico will continue to export its sugar primarily to fulfil United States needs. Mexico is expected to continue resorting to US HFCS to meet national demand for sweeteners. In the European Union, sugar imports are foreseen to decrease to 1.9 Mt by 2032 because of the lower demand. On the export side, sugar markets are projected to remain highly concentrated (Figure 5.7). Four main countries will continue to account for more than 88% of the market share for raw sugar by 2032: Brazil (60%), Thailand (14%), India (8%) and Australia (7%). For white sugar, Brazil (24%), Thailand (19%), India (15%) and the European Union (5%) will supply about 63% of the market. Brazil will remain the leading exporter (46% in 2032) (Figure 5.7). Millers should benefit from attractive incentives to produce sugar for exports. Favourable returns for sugarcane-based ethanol production will continue to play a key role, but the expected growth in sugarcane production for sugar is higher than for ethanol which frees up more sugar for exports. Brazilian sugar exports are expected to reach 34 Mt in 2032, +6 Mt over the outlook period, mainly under the form of raw sugar although the share of white sugar is foreseen to increase, from 14% to 21% by 2032. In Thailand, the world’s second largest sugar exporter, very little ethanol is produced directly from sugarcane (less than 2%) because molasses or cassava are mainly used. By 2032, the share of sugar exports is expected to increase to 16% and reach 11.8 Mt. This compares to a share of 11% and a volume of 6.9 Mt during the base period, which is due to the drop in production in 2020. In India, sugar exports are not expected to grow significantly amid government’s continued efforts to promote ethanol. In Australia, another export-oriented country, sugar exports are expected to continue to account for about three\u0002quarters of production. 0 5 10 15 20 25 2010-122020-22 2032 2010-122020-22 2032 2010-122020-22 2032 2010-122020-22 2032 2010-122020-22 2032 2010-122020-22 2032 2010-122020-22 2032 North America Latin American and the Caribbean Europe & Central Asia Near East and North Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Developed and East Asia South and Southeast Asia Mt tq Raw sugar White sugar  181 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 5.7.

The downward pressure on prices is expected to be partially offset by constant real international crude oil prices, as this would encourage the use of sugar crops for ethanol production (Figure 5.8). Overall, real prices should fall below the average level of the last 20 years, when prices were under upward pressure due to competition from biofuels (ethanol). Nominal prices are projected to follow a moderate upward trend, as demand is foreseen to return to pre\u0002COVID-19 pandemic levels, assuming little change in relative ethanol and sugar prices. The white sugar premium (difference between white and raw sugar prices), which was particularly high (on average USD 101/t during the base period) due to increasing energy costs and tightness on the white sugar market, is anticipated to slightly increase in nominal terms over the outlook period, with the increase in the share of white sugar exports in total trade by 2032. 5.4. Risks and uncertainties This Outlook assumes normal climatic conditions which gives favourable prospect for sugar crop production. But unfavourable weather events, such as those linked to climate change, could have a marked impact on output and prices, considering the relatively high market concentration for export. A change in the price ratio between crops could also influence planting decisions in favour of more profitable crops. The fluctuation of crude oil and sugar relative prices affects the competitiveness and profitability of sugar production versus sugar crop-based ethanol production, and remains a major source of uncertainty. This fluctuation plays an important role in the decisions of the sugarcane millers as to the profitability of sugar vis-à-vis ethanol, which in turn impacts the sugar quantity produced for the international market. In Brazil, additionally, the fuel prices for refined petroleum products can be set freely, although consideration must be given to the influence of the Brazilian state-owned petroleum industry Petrobras. Its decision on when and how to react to the international crude oil price could have some influence on the level of the national gasoline price. In India, the implementation of policies promoting the development of biofuels will add pressure on the availability of sugarcane for sugar, with the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme aimed at reaching a blending rate of 20% of ethanol in petrol (E20) by 2025/26. While this Outlook already accounts for the above-mentioned policy, any further policy development could have a consequential effect on sugar production. Domestic policies may also cause market variability. In this Outlook, the risk that Mexico imposed a ban on genetically modified corn to be activated in 2025 is not taken into account. If implemented, it could affect Mexico HFCS imports from the United States and by repercussion, US sugar imports from Mexico, which are foreseen to account for about 40% of the highly regulated American imports. In countries with high levels of consumption, if a sugar tax is implemented in an attempt to curb consumption for health reasons, this could also lead to effects that are enhanced as the price elasticity of the demand is high. Consumers’ preferences towards low- and no-sugar products could also contribute to curb consumption projections. Similarly, if the market for alternative lower calorie sugar substitutes expands, in response to increasing health concerns, this will have implications on sugar demand. On the supply side, the dominance of few exporters over the next ten years is also a source of uncertainty for sugar markets. About 60% of sugar is traded under the form of raw in-bulk vessels. Given the growing demand for imports of white sugar, investments are expected to increase the export capacity of refined sugar, which is much more delicate due to the risks of contamination, drying out and clumping. According to the outlook, the white sugar premium should be attractive enough for Brazil, a traditional exporter of raw sugar, and Thailand to invest in their white sugar delivery capacity. However, refining capacity in destination countries could also develop, which would change the situation.  183 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 New investments in research and development in the sector (new breeding techniques for sugar crops such as gene editing), new diversification opportunities for the sugar industry (bioethanol, bioplastics and biogas) could also influence the dynamic of the market.

The chapter concludes with a discussion of key risks and uncertainties which have implications for world meat markets over the next decade. 6 Meat  185 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 6.1. Projection highlights Inflation dampens growth in demand in the early years The Outlook expects downward pressure on the growth of meat demand amid high and rising consumer costs and weak income growth. This is anticipated to persist in the early years of the Outlook, with reduced purchasing power, despite the government household support offered in some countries. Consumers are expected to shift spending priorities to limit the overall purchase of meat, which constitutes a sizeable share of the food basket in middle- and high-income countries. This may include, inter alia, a shift toward cheaper meats and meat cuts, as well as reduced out-of-home food expenditures. Over the projection period, it is expected that global average per capita demand for meat will increase by 2%, from the 2020-2022 base period to 2032. Consumption growth in middle-income countries will account for a significant share of this increase (Figure 6.1). As noted in last year’s Outlook, disposable income in high-income countries is no longer a main determinant of changes in meat consumption. Instead, concerns about human health, environmental impacts and animal welfare are the main motivations prompting consumers in these countries to shift towards a diet that shifts demand among meat products (e.g. red vs white meat) or reduces overall meat demand. In middle-income countries, where economic growth, urbanization, and the growth of the fast-food industry progresses, more significant changes in the consumer meat choices are anticipated. In low-income countries, high population growth is expected to remain the key driver of higher meat consumption. However, limited access at relatively low income levels will continue to constrain growth in per capita meat consumption, which is only 15% of the average in high\u0002income countries. The structure of global meat markets in recent years was affected by the significant decline in pigmeat consumption due to the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), that started in 2018. The Outlook projects its per capita consumption to return to the level preceding the outbreak by 2023, as the impact on domestic availability abates and per capita consumption returns to its longer-term trend. The modernisation of the supply chain and improved genetics, combined with increasing investment in large-scale production units, will reduce production costs and increase productivity, and support a rebound in Chinese meat consumption. Growth in meat supply will expand to meet modestly rising demand Global herd and flock expansion, combined with continuous improvements in animal breeding, management, infrastructures, and technology will increase production over the outlook period, particularly in upper middle-income countries (+14%). These countries will drive the growth in global meat production to reach 382 Mt (+12%) by 2032. Nevertheless, high inflation and rising costs early in the projection period will limit the medium-term growth per annum (p.a.) to a slower pace (1% p.a.) than in the last decade (1.2% p.a.). Global meat production will be mainly driven by growth in poultry meat and a significant increase in pigmeat production assuming ongoing recovery from the major outbreaks of ASF in Asia in the first years in the coming decade. The recovery in pigmeat production in the Philippines and Thailand is assumed to be completed by 2026. The various outbreaks have highlighted the need to implement a comprehensive policy approach that combines biosecurity measures, surveillance, compensation, import/export regulations, and the development of a vaccination programme to successfully control and recover from ASF. 186  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 6.1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/mcpdaq Lower growth in trade as domestic supplies rise in importing countries The main features of the global meat trade will be the ongoing reduction in China’s meat imports, which is expected to be offset by a growing demand from middle-income countries in Asia that shift toward diets that include higher shares of animal products, and from low-income countries with high population growth. On the other hand, rising domestic production in several other countries including Iran, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Viet Nam, and in particular countries in Latin America, is likely to dampen the growth of their meat imports in the medium term. As a result, the global meat trade will expand by only 0.7% p.a., much slower than in the last decade. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Meat consumption (kg rwe/person) GDP ('000 USD/person) Pork 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Meat consumption (kg rwe/person) GDP ('000 USD/person) Poultry Low-income countries Lower middle-income countries Upper middle-income countries High-income countries Projections 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Meat consumption (kg rwe/person) GDP ('000 USD/person) Beef and veal Low-income countries Lower middle-income countries Upper middle-income countries High-income countries Projections 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 Meat consumption (kg rwe/person) GDP ('000 USD/person) Sheep  187 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Lower feed costs and productivity gains bring prices down in real terms This Outlook projects that while nominal meat prices remain high, they are anticipated to be soften in 2023 and continue to decline modestly in real terms over the next decade with weaker demand, lower feed costs (in real term), and ongoing productivity growth. As feed prices decrease and consumer spending on meat recovers in middle-income countries, particularly for poultry and pigmeat, overall meat prices will return to their long-term trend levels. However, demand growth for red meat products, particularly in middle-income countries, combined with lower productivity gains, will keep their prices in real terms relatively more expensive over the outlook period. Animal disease outbreaks are significant risks in the meat sector The meat sector faces various uncertainties, including changing consumer preferences, public health concerns, climate impacts, international trade policies, and animal welfare concerns. With relatively large income elasticities, meat demand remains sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly in emerging developing countries. On the supply side, recent animal diseases such as African Swine Fever (ASF) and Avian Influenza (AI) have disrupted supply chains and resulted in the culling of large numbers of animals. These outbreaks have also led to trade restrictions and reduced demand for meat products due to public health concerns. The uncertainties related to animal diseases highlight the importance of collaboration between government and industry stakeholders in investing in biosecurity measures and effective treatments to ensure the sector's sustainability. 6.2. Current market trends International market prices rise due to limited supplies Global meat production is estimated to have grown 1% to 347 Mt cwe in 2022. Several factors limited growth, including animal diseases, high and rising input costs, and extreme weather events. The expansion was driven primarily by increased output in Asia, specifically a rise in pigmeat production in China for a second year. In North and South America, production remained relatively stable, while it declined in Europe and Oceania. Generally, the industry’s profitability improved somewhat toward the end of 2022 as the cost for input such as energy, animal feed, and fertilisers abated. However, disruptions due to animal diseases continue to disrupt meat production in many large-producing countries, with resulting trade restrictions. In 2022, global meat exports declined by 3% to 40 Mt, primarily due to production shortfalls and higher internal demand in major exporting countries, including Brazil, Canada, the European Union, the United States and New Zealand. In addition, pigmeat imports in ASF recovering regions also contracted as their domestic supplies recovered. However, some countries, including Australia, China, India, Thailand, and Türkiye, experienced a year-on-year increase in meat exports. With lower export supplies, the FAO meat price index rose to average 118.8 in 2022, an increase of 10% from the previous year. Despite this increase, meat-to-feed price ratios remained low, squeezing profitability in intensive feed-grain livestock operations at the start of the Outlook period. 188  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 6.3. Market projections 6.3.1. Consumption Meat demand is only expanding marginally in high-income countries Meat consumption patterns of consumers in most high-income countries (which represent 33% of total meat consumption for 16% of population in 2022) have started to stagnate, with changes mostly based on the type and quality of the meat consumed. However, due to their lower base intake and more rapid increases in population and incomes, growth will be generated primarily from low- and middle-income countries. Worldwide, poultry, pigmeat, beef, and sheepmeat consumption is projected to grow 15%, 11%, 10%, and 15% respectively by 2032. Poultry meat is expected to account for 41% of the protein consumed from all meat sources in 2032, followed by pig, bovine and ovine meat. The overall growth in the volume of meat consumption, aside from the United States, Brazil and China, is expected to be greater in low-income countries, especially India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Viet Nam, and the Sub-Saharan region of Africa. On a per capita basis, global meat consumption is set to rise by 2%. This increase of 0.7 kg/year/person on an edible retail weight equivalent basis (hereafter “rwe”) by 2032 is similar to the previous decade and, again, is mainly due to the increase in the consumption of poultry meat (Box 6.1). Globally, there is a growing trend among consumers to become increasingly sensitive to animal welfare, environmental and health concerns, and poultry has the least carbon footprint. In some instances, these shifts in preferences may lead to shrinking per capita meat consumption, as in the case of the European Union, for which the Outlook foresees an ongoing substitution of beef and pigmeat by poultry meat. Box 6.1. Edible retail weight This Outlook introduces a new second-level conversion factor to standardise meat products at different levels of the food chain. The first level converts live animal weight (lw) to carcass weight equivalent (cwe), commonly used as a basis for meat statistics. The cwe unit only includes the meat, fat, and carcass bones. The live to carcass weight conversion factor can vary based on various factors such as age, sex, breed, environment, and diet of the live animal. National authorities typically use representative conversion factors for their production, consumption, and trade statistics, compiled by their national statistics institutes. A second-level conversion factor is employed to obtain a more accurate figure of the edible portion of the carcass, eliminating the non-edible parts. The carcass undergoes further trimming, deboning, and processing to calculate a boneless retail weight equivalent (rwe). However, the values for converting a carcass into edible equivalents can fluctuate significantly depending on the region, chosen methodology, processing techniques and the desired end product. The Outlook applies the following standardised conversion factor to the carcass weight equivalent to derive the relevant rwe.

The global increase in protein from poultry consumption as a share of total protein from meat has been the main feature in the growth in meat consumption for decades, this trend is expected to continue (Figure 6.2). This is due to several factors, particularly the lower price of poultry compared to other types of meat and that it contains a healthy combination of protein and low fat. Environmental considerations also contributed to the shift towards poultry meat, as the production of red meat is often resource-intensive and can lead to high greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, poultry production is generally considered more efficient and less resource-intensive, making it a more sustainable choice for meat. The increase in poultry consumption in the last decade was driven by rising consumption in Asia, particularly in China, India and Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. These trends will continue, but consumption is projected to grow rapidly in other regions, including Brazil, Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States, reflecting poultry’s significant and increasing role in diets worldwide. Over the next decade, global pigmeat consumption is also projected to grow globally, apart from Europe, where consumption is already high, and health, environmental and societal concerns significantly impact consumer choice. However, pigmeat will remain the most widely consumed meat in the European region. Pigmeat will be the second largest contributor to the total growth in meat consumption and is projected to reach 93 Mt rwe by 2032. However, in per capita terms, this growth will be stagnant over the projection period. In Latin American countries per capita consumption is projected to increase, due to favourable relative pigmeat/beef prices. Elsewhere, per capita demand is anticipated to be stagnant or decline. Global beef consumption is projected to reach 51 Mt rwe over the next decade. Global per capita consumption has fluctuated around 6 kg per capita rwe for the last decade and is expected to remain stable over the outlook period. Most regions are projected to reduce their beef intake apart from the Asia-Pacific region, where per capita beef consumption is projected to increase by 0.4 kg/year rwe. There are growing concerns about the environmental impact of beef production, which is perceived as a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, deforestation caused by land-use changes for grazing and feed production is also concerning. As a result, many consumers have chosen to reduce their beef consumption in favour of poultry meat which has a smaller environmental footprint. North America and Oceania, which historically have strongly preferred beef, are expected to see the most significant decrease in per capita consumption. In contrast, China, the world’s second-largest beef consumer although relatively low in per capita terms, is projected to see a further 0.8 kg/year rwe increase in its per capita consumption by 2032. This is partly due to a growing middle class in China, which has increased demand for meat, including beef. While sheepmeat consumption is a relatively small part of the global meat market, it remains an essential source of protein for many consumers, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. While some change is occurring in global dietary patterns, the contribution of sheepmeat to total protein from meat is projected to remain stable (Figure 6.2). It is mainly a traditional (cultural) food choice, although competition from beef and poultry ensures the latter are often more widely available and cheaper than sheepmeat. 190  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 6.2.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/92gbvp Will meat demand fall in the long term? Rising meat consumption has raised concerns for long term sustainability, given its pressure on global resources and contribution to GHG emissions. The Outlook assumes that consumer preferences will evolve slowly and does not anticipate a significant change in the current trend over the next decade. The implications for GHG emissions are broadly consistent with those of the IPCC. Looking beyond the medium term into the longer term, demographic trends, human health, animal welfare, and environmental concerns may negatively impact meat consumption. Efforts to reduce food loss and waste (FLW), could also lead to a reduction in meat consumption and production (Box 6.2). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 % Share of protein from poultry / Total meat protein Low-income countries Lower middle-income countries Upper middle-income countries High-income countries 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 % Share of protein from beef / Total meat protein 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 % Share of protein from pigmeat / Total meat protein Low-income countries Lower middle-income countries Upper middle-income countries High-income countries 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 % Share of protein from sheep meat / Total meat protein  191 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Box 6.2. Meat sector food loss and waste Global perspectives for the meat sector point to the dilemma between meeting consumers’ growing demands on the one hand and being environmentally sustainable on the other hand. The production of meat and meat products significantly impacts the environment, accounting for around 3.8 gigatons of CO2 equivalent1 per annum. This has led to a growing concern over the sustainability of the meat sector and the need to balance consumer demand with environmental sustainability. One of the solutions to tackle the sustainability of the meat sector is to reduce food loss and waste, which applies to meat products across all regions. While estimates of food loss and waste differ depending on the methodology used, recent research suggests that this could be advanced by developing regional experience on loss and waste at the production and storage levels, especially as these losses are likely to vary across regions of the world. Compared to low-income countries, in industrialised areas, loss and waste occur towards the end of the food chain. For example, in the European Union, 23% of production in the meat sector, taken together at all stages of the food chain, is estimated to be lost and wasted. The method for accounting is the mass flow analysis. The consumption level accounts for 64% of total food waste, followed by manufacturing (20%), distribution (12%), and primary production and post-harvest (3.5%). Aside the amount of food that can be saved from losses, there is a potential to reduce GHGs from the meat sector or to increase production with the same climate impact. For example, in 2020 Sweden beef, pigmeat and milk on farm losses represented 9% of GHGs from animal husbandry. 2 Various measures have been adopted to address these issues, including promoting dietary solutions to reduce meat consumption and reducing loss and waste through technological improvements, product innovation, or the development of more differentiated sales channels to increase the value of different meat parts including their non-edible portions.3 Such measures can lead to higher efficiency and reduce the need for more animal production to meet the increasing demand for meat, thus addressing both demand and sustainability issues.

As discussed in last year's meat chapter of the Outlook, empirical data on consumer behaviour in low\u0002income countries indicates that when income rises beyond a certain level, the proportion of meat protein in the diet increases. As populations and incomes grow, global food demand analysis suggests that low\u0002income groups will consume a greater share of animal-based calories. However, the relationship between income and animal product consumption becomes less clear for higher-income groups. Long-term scenario analysis, as illustrated in Figure 6.3, reveals that upper middle-income countries will drive the increase in demand until 2040. After that, lower middle-income countries will lead, causing demand to grow until 2075. At some point during the remainder of the twenty-first century, global meat demand may begin to decline. Nevertheless, resource and environmental constraints could limit further growth in meat supply and demand, potentially causing the turning point to arrive earlier. 192  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 6.3.

Production High feed and labour costs are slowing growth According to projections, world meat production is expected to increase by 41 Mt cwe to an estimated 382 Mt cwe by 2032, with most of the growth occurring in Asia, led by a 20 Mt increase in poultry production (Figure 6.4). In China, the rise in pigmeat production will offset the projected decline in European output, impacted by factors such as ASF outbreaks, stricter environmental laws, and animal welfare regulations in some EU countries. The ASF outbreak continues to impact Asia, mainly in the Philippines and Thailand and will continue to do so in the early years of the outlook period (Figure 6.7). In recent years, high feed and labour costs have been significant challenges for meat producers worldwide. Feed costs are a significant share of the total cost of meat production, particularly for monogastric animals such as poultry and pigs1(Figure 6.5). This means that fluctuations in feed prices can have a marked impact on meat producers’ profit margins. Similarly, rising labour costs2 make it more difficult for meat producers to expand their operations increasing their financial risk, especially at the beginning of the outlook period, when inflation and interest rates are assumed to remain high. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 1961 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 2055 2060 2065 2070 2075 2080 2085 2090 2095 2100 EJ High-income Low-income countries Lower middle-income Upper middle-income Total  193 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 6.4.

Poultry production will expand rapidly in countries with a surplus of feed grains, such as Brazil and the United States. Expansion is also foreseen in Asia as the shift away from pigmeat triggered by ASF outbreaks has benefitted poultry, particularly in China in recent years. In India, Türkiye and Indonesia, the poultry industry remains one of the fastest growing segments of the agricultural sector, primarily driven by the expanding demand for animal protein and the rising utilisation of eggs for 71 78 117 129 137 156 16 19 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2020-22 2032 Mt c.w.e Beef and veal Pork Poultry Sheep 7 13 20 2 0.9% 0.6% 1.3% 1.3% % growth p.a. 341 Mt 382 Mt 41 Mt Growth of meat (Kt), 2020-22 to 2032 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Beef Sheepmeat Pigmeat Poultry Kg of dry matter feed 194  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 the bakery and confectionery sectors. Poultry has advantages over other meats in terms of production length, costs, feed conversion ratio, and proximity to growing urban markets. However, a high density of poultry production may lead to disease issues. For example, ongoing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) affect poultry and egg production in many countries (Figure 6.6.). However, outbreaks are easily detected due to high mortality rates and clinical signs associated with the disease. This allows for the rapid implementation of control measures and effective vaccines to prevent their spread. In addition, once contained, the short poultry production cycle allows for quick recovery. As a result, the outlook does not assume that HPAI will impact the medium term projection. Figure 6.6. Animal diseases around the world January 2023-March 2023 Note: HPAI: Green dots; ASF: Blue dots. Source: © FAO (2023) Animal disease [https://data.apps.fao.org/] (Accessed March 2023). While a range of factors has driven the shift towards poultry, its production also faces environmental and health challenges, particularly regarding antibiotic use and animal welfare. Therefore, promoting sustainable and responsible poultry production practices will be critical to the long-term growth of the sector. In several European countries, pigmeat output will decline throughout the outlook period. This is because ongoing cost pressures in feed, energy, disease outbreaks (Figure 6.6) and current and future environmental regulations and welfare standards are part of the European Commission’s Farm to Fork Strategy (such as the “End the Cage Age”). Asian ASF recovery is partly due to the modernisation of the sector China’s pigmeat production is assumed to recover, and its share of world production will return to the level of the last decade (45%) after reaching the pre-ASF level in 2023 (Figure 6.7). Viet Nam, which has suffered from ASF-reduced output since 2019, recovered faster as production was not as much affected, and it resumed its pre-ASF trajectory by 2022. As most ASF recovery in Asian countries affected by the disease is assumed to occur in the first half of the Outlook projection, global production is projected to increase by 0.6% p.a. during the next decade. Most of the increase in pigmeat production will occur in the  195 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Asian ASF-affected regions where conversion from largely small-scale backyard holdings to large-scale commercial enterprises with higher biosecurity standards is taking place. 3 Figure 6.7.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/kcgsbt Beef production will reach 78 Mt cwe by the end of the outlook period (Figure 6.3). The main contributors to this expansion are China’s growth following technological improvements, better cattle management and genetics, and increasing milk production in Pakistan, where animals are used for milk and draft purposes. Türkiye will also be one of the main contributors to the production expansion as is expected from government intervention in the form of imports of livestock genetics, higher producer support, and interventions to offset high feed prices. In Australia, increasing slaughter capacity and profitability will trigger higher beef production over the outlook period. Beef production will increase with higher carcass weights as feed costs decline and animal genetics are improved. Increased livestock slaughter numbers also contribute after multiple years of higher herd numbers in several African producing regions (particularly in Sub-Saharan) and Asia. Sheepmeat production is anticipated to reach 19 Mt cwe by 2032 (Figure 6.4). Chinese production is projected to increase in response to high prices and contribute 17% of additional production. Increased availability in the global sheepmeat market will be due to flock rebuilding and increased lambing rates in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Production in the European Union is projected to increase slightly from the current level due to production-coupled income support and favourable producer prices in the main sheep\u0002producing Member States. The share of Africa in global sheepmeat production will slowly increase despite limitations linked to urbanisation, desertification, and feed availability in some countries. New Zealand’s pledge to reduce GHG emissions is expected to constrain flock size as productive sheep land is converted into plantations for carbon credits. 10 000 20 000 30 000 40 000 50 000 60 000 70 0001 000 2 000 3 000 4 000 5 000 6 000 7 000 20002002200420062008201020122014201620182020202220242026202820302032 Vietnam Thailand Philippines China (Right axis) Assumed duration of ASF 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2000 2002 20042006200820102012201420162018 2020202220242026202820302032 Mt Mt 196  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 6.3.3. Trade Concentration of meat exports will decrease Global meat exports are projected to rise 3% by 2032 from the base period, reaching 42 Mt cwe with almost 11% of meat output traded. Still, the growth in the meat trade is projected to decelerate compared to the past decade. Developed countries are still expected to account for more than half (55%) of global meat exports by 2032, a share which is 3% point lower than in the base period. However, the share of Brazil and the United States, each representing 20%, will remain stable over the projection period. Australia and Türkiye are expected to record the most significant increase in world meat exports globally, benefiting from a favourable exchange rate and ample feed grain availability. Other traditional exporting countries, such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Thailand, are also expected to contribute to the increase in the global meat trade. On the other hand, the European Union export share will decline from 18% in the base year to 15% in 2032. The most significant growth in import demand originates from Africa, which will account for the 78% of additional imports of all meat types. Asia, excluding China, is another fast-growing meat importing region. While Chinese meat imports remain high in the early part of the projection period, a gradual decline is projected as pigmeat production recovers from the ASF outbreak. In terms of composition, poultry will account for two third of the additional meat imports, bringing its share of total meat imports to 40% by 2032. Australia and New Zealand will continue to lead global sheepmeat markets. Australia is expected to increase lamb exports (of higher value) to high end restaurants at the expense of mutton, while in New Zealand, exports will slowly decline as land use shifts from sheep farming. The source of higher import demand is the rising middle-class consumer in the Middle East. 6.3.4. Prices China is a key factor affecting meat prices The Outlook projects that although meat prices are currently high, they are expected to decrease in both nominal and real terms at the start of the outlook period (Figure 6.8) under weaker demand and higher supplies as the impact of disease outbreaks wanes, particularly in China. The evolution of the situation in China impacts the world reference price of pigmeat and, to a lesser extent, that of other meats. In fact, at the start of the outlook period, the faster China recovers from ASF and lowers its meat imports, the lower prices will be in subsequent years. As markets recover from these disruptions and consumer spending on meat in middle-income countries resumes, particularly for poultry and pigmeat, prices are expected to return to their long-term trend decline in real terms. As a result, by 2032, meat prices in real terms are projected to be 10% to 15% lower than their 2020-2022 averages. Moreover, red meat prices will be increasingly higher than pigmeat and poultry due to more limited productivity gains.  197 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 6.8.

Risks and uncertainties Animal disease outbreaks remain the most significant risk in the meat sector The meat sector faces several uncertainties in meeting the increasing demand for meat products while addressing concerns about animal disease, environmental sustainability, consumer preferences, animal welfare, public health and trade policies. The livestock and meat sector often face severe economic impacts due to disease outbreaks. These disruptions have socio-economic costs, depending on the country and situation, including the loss of export markets, reduced imports from affected countries, or decreased consumer purchases due to health concerns. While these costs can be high globally, they can be mitigated by supplies from alternative disease-free markets or by following World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) protocols that localise disease impacts on trade4 (Box 6.3). The ASF outbreaks in Asia have illustrated how disease outbreaks can affect domestic and international markets. In the European Union, the other producing region most affected by ASF outbreaks, a study5 has suggested that an ASF outbreak can reduce the production of pigmeat, export quantities and the national pig inventory in the short and medium term. On average, new cases of ASF reduced the exports of pigmeat by close to 15%, production by more than 4% in the year after the cases occurred, and the national pig inventory by 3-4% in the current and the following year. However, only indirect effects on pigmeat prices, (such as the amount received in compensation and the market value), were observed. After discovering the ASF virus in wild boars in Germany, several countries decided to suspend imports of German products. Exports to the usual international markets were thus mainly redirected to the European market. The countries that accept German products have been unable to compensate for the loss in 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 1 000 2 000 3 000 4 000 5 000 6 000 7 000 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 4 000 200220072012201720222027203220022007201220172022202720322002200720122017202220272032200220072012201720222027 2032 Pork Poultry Beef (right axis) Sheep (right axis) USD/t USD/t Nominal price Real price 198  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 volume and value that occurred on the international markets. Germany’s experience with the disease served as an object of study by the French Pork Institute (IFIP) to extrapolate the situation and estimate the potential economic impact of ASF on the French industry. The export market's estimated loss is between EUR 157 and EUR 364 million, underscoring the higher “market risks” associated with disease outbreaks. The impact of climate change on livestock production, such the availability of feed, water, and other resources critical to livestock production, is gaining increased attention. Droughts, floods, and extreme weather events are expected to become more common, reducing productivity and increasing producer costs. A growing trend in consumer preferences is toward more healthy and environmentally conscious purchases, which may result in a shift away from traditional meat products and could have significant implications for the meat industry. Furthermore, public health concerns such as antibiotic resistance are increasing, and there are pressures to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal agriculture. International trade plays a vital role in the meat sector, and changes in trade policies – tariffs and trade bans can also significantly impact national and global markets. Globally, the meat industry faces pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to their significant contribution to climate change. The FAO reports that the livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions (7.1 gigatonnes of Co2-equivalent per year), 6 with beef and dairy production being the main contributors. The production and consumption of meat, particularly red meat, require large amounts of resources, including land, water, and energy, resulting in emissions of greenhouse gases that can harm human health and the environment. The livestock industry needs to adopt sustainable practices such as improving feed, manure management and energy efficiency to reduce emissions. The Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM) estimate the mitigation potential for the sector to be around 33%, or about 2.5 gigatonnes CO2-eq. 7 This figure arises from the assumption that producers in a given system, region and agroecological zone apply the practices of the 10th percentile of producers with the lowest emissions intensities while maintaining constant output. Achieving this will require investment in research, technology, and infrastructure and collaboration between the industry and government stakeholders to implement policies and regulatory frameworks that support a sustainable and climate-resilient livestock sector. Box 6.3. Implications of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and global meat market segmentation The Outlook projections generally assume integrated global markets, where the \"law-of-one-price\" applies across national and international markets, subject to border measures which may weaken price linkages. In this respect, it is assumed that there is one integrated international market for a given commodity, and price shocks are transmitted spatially across borders. An important exception has been for the global markets of bovine and pigmeat due, among other things, to the significance of foot and mouth disease (FMD), which continues to be present in 77%1 of the global livestock population in countries that hold some three quarters of the world’s population. Segmentation arises from the application of sanitary barriers by countries free from FMD, given their concern for the disease’s highly contagious nature that enables transmission readily via live animals, traded meat, or human movement. In 1927, the United States introduced sanitary legislation banning meat imports from countries where FMD was endemic, leading to the creation of two different beef markets, known as the Pacific and Atlantic markets.2 The Pacific area, free of FMD, experienced gradual expansion, while the Atlantic market, endemic to the disease, produced growing surpluses and was unable to access more wealthy FMD free markets, resulting in significant price differentials between the two zones, to the advantage of the Pacific traders. However, with changing technologies, institutional arrangements and market structures, some analysts have  199 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 questioned whether the international bovine and pigmeat markets remain effectively segmented in product flow and price transmission. The nature of FMD market segmentation has changed considerably over time. First, policy changes, such as status assessments and conditions established by the World Organization for Animal Health, have enabled FMD-free zones within FMD endemic countries adopting mitigation risk measures, allowing trade to occur (for more details, see https://www.woah.org/en/disease/foot-and-mouth-disease/#ui-id-2) 3 . For example, such zoning has allowed Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of bovine meat and fourth largest pigmeat exporter, establish trade with the Pacific market.4 Vaccines for FMD have also become more widely used in FMD infected countries, enabling tighter disease control and trade, and vaccination strategies have been widely pursued. Second, from a market structure perspective, some FMD-free countries of the Pacific zone have been shipping large quantities of bovine and pigmeat into the FMD endemic market of the Atlantic zone (Figure 6.9), reaching at times 30-40% of their total shipments. Their participation in the FMD market has grown over time. Such a surplus situation is anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future, implying a considerably stronger connection between the two zones. Figure 6.9.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/q4175w Third, evidence of this connection can be seen in the co-movement of indicative prices of the two zones displayed in Figure 6.10 over the past two decades. Formal statistical tests using monthly data for unit export values of frozen boneless beef for Australia, Brazil, and the United States from 2000 to 2021 do not reject the hypothesis of co-integration between these series, with the Australian price influencing Brazil and US price movements. Similar tests using monthly export unit values for pigmeat for Brazil, Germany and US prices indicate co-integration between the United States and Brazil series only, with detection of causality between the US price influencing the Brazilian price. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 2000200120022003200420052006 2007200820092010201120122013201420152016 20172018201920202021 % Pigmeat Beef 200  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 6.10.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/ztgowy In previous editions of the Outlook, it has been presumed that segmented markets between the Pacific or FMD free zone and the Atlantic or FMD zone exist for bovine and pigmeat. The Aglink-Cosimo model underlying the projections of the Outlook has specified such segmentation in the trade between the two regions. Supported by an updated analysis of markets (as described above), the projection of this Outlook presumes a high degree of integration of trade between these zones, such that quantity flows will bind common price movements as is the case for the other commodities. The underlying model assumption is that the law of one price applies across the two zones for both bovine and pigmeat. Should any of the conditions for such integration fail over the outlook period, such as a significant outbreak of FMD in a large FMD-free exporting country, market structures could change quickly and significantly affect the market assessment of this Outlook.

In major meat producing countries with intensive farming systems chicken feed costs can account for 60-70% of the total cost of production, while in pig production, it can account for 50-70% of the total cost. In ruminant animals such as cattle and sheep, feed costs are generally a lower proportion as these animals can graze on pasture and consume a wider range of feed sources. In the case of feedlot operations, it can represent around 25% of the total cost. However, the total cost of cattle production is much higher, as is total feed use per kg of meat produced. 2 For example, in broiler chicken production, labour costs can account for around 5-10% of the total cost of production, while in pig production, it can be around 10-20%. In the case of ruminant animals, labour costs are generally lower as they require less intensive management, with some exceptions, such as feedlot operations, for which labour cost can represent around 8% (publications.gc.ca/pub?id=9.581110&sl=0). 3 For more information on how ASF may impact agricultural markets and to compare various outcomes induced by the ASF outbreak in China see Frezal, C., H.

Projections cover consumption, production, trade and prices for milk, fresh dairy products, butter, cheese, skim milk powder and whole milk powder. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key risks and uncertainties which could have implications for world dairy markets over the next decade. 7 Dairy and dairy products  203 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 7.1. Projection highlights Buoyant dairy sectors in South Asia and Africa Milk and dairy products are vital sources of nutrition and provide livelihoods for millions of people in dairy value chains across the world. As income and population increase, more dairy products are expected to be consumed over the medium term. The key locations of this strong demand growth are India, Pakistan, and several African countries. Overall, per capita consumption is projected to increase 0.8% p.a. to 15.7 kg (milk solids equivalent, excluding the water content of milk or dairy products) by 2032. Most dairy production is consumed in the form of fresh dairy products, which are unprocessed or only slightly processed (i.e. pasteurised or fermented) and their share in world consumption is expected to increase over the next decade. In low- and middle-income countries, fresh dairy products comprise over two-thirds of the average per capita dairy consumption (milk solids), while consumers in high-income countries tend to consume more processed products (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1. Per capita consumption of processed and fresh dairy products in milk solids Note: Milk solids are calculated by adding the amount of fat and non-fat solids for each product; Processed dairy products include butter, cheese, skim milk powder and whole milk powder.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/nk2pvj Cheese is the most important processed dairy product consumed in terms of milk solids, which primarily occurs in Europe and North America and is increasing in both regions. In Asia, butter is not only the most consumed processed dairy product, accounting for almost half of all processed dairy consumption in terms of milk solids, but it also has the strongest projected growth. In Africa, cheese and whole milk powder (WMP) account for the majority of processed dairy consumption. Over the coming decade, however, skim milk powder (SMP) is expected to record the highest growth, although from a lower base. World milk production (roughly 81% cow, 15% buffalo, and 4% for goat, sheep and camels combined) is projected to grow at 1.5% p.a. over the next decade (to 1 039 Mt in 2032), faster than most other main agricultural commodities. Over half of the increase in total milk production is anticipated to come from India and Pakistan, which will jointly account for over 32% of world production in 2032. Production in the second largest global milk producer, the European Union, is expected to decline slightly in response to stagnating domestic demand due to low population growth and declining per capita consumption of fresh dairy products, policies targeted to a transition to sustainable production, the expansion of organic production, 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 World China Sub-Saharan Africa Latin America United States European Union India Pakistan kg/person Processed dairy products Fresh dairy products 204  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 and pasture-based production systems. Globally, the projected growth in the number of milk-producing animals is expected to be strong, especially in regions with low yields such as Sub-Saharan Africa and in major milk-producing countries such as India and Pakistan. Over the projection period, yields across the world are expected to grow steadily with the strongest growth expected in Southeast Asian countries. Milk is traded internationally mainly in the form of processed dairy products. The People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”) is expected to remain the most important importer of milk products despite a stronger increase in domestic milk production relative to the past decade. The projected increase in import demand for dairy products in Southeast Asian countries will be driven by population as well as income growth, which favours more livestock products in diets. However, their per capita consumption is projected to remain low relative to traditional dairy consumer markets. The Russian Federation (hereafter “Russia”), Mexico and countries in the Near East and North Africa (NENA), especially Saudi Arabia, will also continue to be important net importers of dairy products. Over the medium term, the European Union, New Zealand, and the United States will remain the key exporters of processed dairy product and are projected to jointly account for around 65% of cheese, 70% of WMP, 70% of butter, and 80% of SMP exports in 2032. Since 2015, the unit price of butter has been considerably higher than for SMP. This development is attributed to stronger demand for milk fat compared to other milk solids on the international market. It is expected that this gap will persist throughout the projection period. Overall, prices are expected to develop in line with other major agricultural commodities experiencing a slight nominal increase following a downward adjustment in the first years of the Outlook. Although the growth rate of plant-based replacements is strong in many regions, including East Asia, Europe, Oceania and North America, contested views regarding their environmental impact and health benefits lead to uncertainties about their long-term impact on dairy demand. Over the projection period the per capita consumption of fresh dairy products is expected to decline in Europe, Oceania and North America, partly at the expense of an increasing consumption of plant-based replacements. The introduction of new sustainable production policies or consumer acceptance issues of dairy products will impact the projections for the dairy sector. In some countries, dairy production accounts for a substantial share of overall greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), resulting in considerations of how adjustments to dairy production scale and technology could contribute to reducing such emissions. Only a relatively small share of global milk production is traded internationally in the form of processed products, mainly powders and cheese. In addition, trade in dairy products is often covered specifically in regional trade agreements. Consequently, new or changed trade agreements tend to alter the global dairy trade. Any entry of India, the world’s largest dairy producer and consumer, into the international market could have a strong impact. Currently, some Indian dairy companies are showing interest in exporting to neighbouring countries. 7.2. Current market trends Dairy prices reached record highs in 2022 but then started to decline In 2022 the FAO Dairy Price Index value increased by 20% across all dairy products, reaching a new record high. International dairy prices reached their peak around mid-2022 and have started to decline slowly since. Nevertheless, domestic milk prices peaked later and only started to decline towards the end of 2022. The main drivers of prices were energy and feed costs, both showing a similar pattern, but with larger swings compared to those for dairy and milk. World milk production grew by 0.7% in 2022 to about 897 Mt. In India, production increased by 2.2% to 194 Mt., but with little impact on the world dairy market as they trade only marginal quantities of milk and  205 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 dairy products. Focusing on the three major exporters, the production of the European Union remained unchanged during 2022 but declined in New Zealand and increased in the United States. The world dairy trade in 2022 declined due to considerably smaller import demand from China, especially for whole milk powder (WMP). On the other hand, other major importers of dairy products ‒ Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Mexico - increased their imports. Of the large exporters, the United States would be a strong beneficiary of any additional exports. 7.3. Market projections 7.3.1. Consumption Strong demand in India and Pakistan is leading increased global dairy consumption Although milk is a highly perishable product which must be processed shortly after collection, most milk is consumed in the form of fresh dairy products,1including those fermented and pasteurised. The share of fresh dairy products in global consumption is expected to increase over the coming decade due to stronger demand growth in India and Pakistan, which in turn is driven by income and population growth. World per capita consumption of fresh dairy products is projected to increase by 1.0% p.a. over the coming decade, slightly faster than over the past ten years, primarily driven by higher per-capita income growth. Milk consumption per capita (in terms of milk solids) will vary largely worldwide (Figure 7.1), driven by varying growth in incomes and regional preferences. In low- and lower middle-income countries most of the production is consumed in the form of fresh dairy products. The consumption of fresh dairy products per capita is expected to be high in India and Pakistan, but low in China. In Europe and North America, overall per capita demand for fresh dairy products is stable to declining but the composition of demand has been shifting over recent years towards dairy fat such as full-fat drinking milk and cream. Plant-based dairy replacements are increasingly established and competing more with fresh dairy products than with processed dairy products. The share of processed dairy products, especially cheese, in overall consumption of milk solids is expected to be closely related to incomes, with variations due to local preferences, dietary constraints, and urbanisation. The largest share of total cheese consumption, the second most consumed dairy product, occurs in Europe and North America, where per capita consumption is expected to continue to increase over the projection period (Figure 7.2). Consumption of cheese will also increase in regions where it has not been traditionally part of the national diet. In Southeast Asian countries, urbanisation and income increases have resulted in more away-from-home eating, including fast food such as burgers and pizzas. 206  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 7.2.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4cwymt Butter consumption has seen a recovery in Europe and North America due to shifting preferences. Consumers may be influenced by recent studies that have shed a more positive light on the health impact from butter consumption, contrary to earlier messaging. The dominant use of SMP and WMP will continue to be in the manufacturing sector, notably in confectionery, infant formula, and bakery products. A small share of dairy products, especially SMP and whey powder, are used in animal feed. Whey powders are gaining prominence globally because of their use in the processing of nutritional products, especially of clinical, infant, and elderly preparations. 7.3.2. Production Greater efficiency in milk production from yield growth World milk production is projected to grow at 1.5% p.a. (to 1 039 Mt by 2032) over the next decade, faster than most other main agricultural commodities. Growth in the number of milk-producing animals is expected to be strong (1.3% p.a.), especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and in major milk-producing countries such as India and Pakistan – where yields are low. Yields across the world are expected to grow steadily over the next decade. Nevertheless, in most regions of the world, yield growth is expected to contribute more to production increases than herd growth (Figure 7.3), the drivers of which include optimising milk production systems, improved animal health and feed efficiencies, and improved genetics. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 North America Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Near East and North Africa Developed and East Asia South and Southeast Asia Sub-Saharan Africa kg/person 2010-12 2020-22 2032  207 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 7.3.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/duc1rw India is the largest producer of milk and is expected to experience a continued strong production growth. Production is based on small households connected to cooperatives for processing and distribution. This integration into the wider supply chains is also important for the value attached to dairying in India. The growth is expected to come from more milking cows and buffaloes as well as from yield increases. Production in the European Union is projected to decline with fewer dairy herds and slower yield growth. Production originates from a mix of grass- and feed-based production systems. In addition, a growing share of milk is expected to be organic or from other non-conventional production systems. At present, more than 10% of dairy cows are within, but not limited to, organic systems located in Austria, Denmark, Greece, Latvia, and Sweden. Germany and France have also seen an increase in organic dairy production. However, as organic yields are about a quarter lower than in conventional production systems, and higher production costs, they need to command a substantial price premium. North America has some of the highest average yields per cow, as the share of grass-based production is low, and feeding is focused on high yields from specialised dairy herds (Figure 7.4). Dairy herds in the United States and Canada are expected to remain largely unchanged and production growth to originate from further yield increases. As domestic demand is projected to remain stronger for milk fats, the United States will continue to expand SMP exports.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/pcnb83 Although the share of New Zealand in world milk production is only 2.5%, it is the most export-orientated country. After expanding milk production strongly over the last twenty years, milk output growth has stalled in recent years, and is projected to grow at 0.4% p.a. over the next decade. Milk production is mainly grass\u0002based, and yields are considerably lower than in North America and Europe. The cost efficiency of grass management, however, allows New Zealand to be competitive. The main constraining factors for growth are land availability and increasing environmental restrictions and the pricing of enteric methane from 2025 (Zero Carbon Amendment Act of 2019 to the Climate Change Response Act of 2002), but a shift to a more feed-based production is not likely. Strong production growth is expected in Africa, mostly due to larger herds. These will usually have low yields, and a considerable share of milk production will come from goats and sheep. Most cows, goats and sheep graze, and are used for other purposes including meat production, traction, and as capital assets (savings). Additional grazing occurs on the same pasture, leading to a more intensive use which may lead to local over-grazing. Over the projection period, about a third of the worldwide herd population is projected to be in Africa and to account for around 6% of world milk production. Globally, around 30% of milk will be further processed into products such as butter, cheese, SMP, WMP, or whey powder in the coming decade. However, there is notable regional dispersion. In high-income countries, most of the milk production is transformed into dairy products. Given the considerable direct food demand for butter and cheese, these presently account for a large share of consumption of milk solids in Europe and North America. SMP and WMP are largely produced for trade, for use in the food processing sector, notably in confectionery, infant formulae, and bakery products. In low- and lower middle-income countries most of the milk production goes into fresh dairy products. 7.3.3. Trade Trade will expand from a few major exporting to many dispersed importing countries Only around 7% of world milk production is traded internationally, primarily due to its perishability and high\u0002water content (more than 85%). Over 50% of world production of WMP and SMP is traded since these products are often produced only to store and trade milk over a longer time period or distance.

An exception is imports of liquid milk by China from the European Union and New Zealand, due to Ultra-High Temperature milk and cream products able to be shipped long distances, but also favourable Chinese freight rates in some cases. China’s net imports of fresh dairy products over the base period reached 1.2 Mt, and this is not projected to increase much over the next decade. World dairy trade is projected to expand over the next decade to reach 14.2 Mt in 2032, 11% higher than during the base period. Most of this growth will be met by increased exports from the United States, the European Union and New Zealand. These three countries are projected to jointly account for around 65% of cheese, 70% of WMP, 70% of butter, and 80% of SMP exports in 2032 (Figure 7.5). Australia, another exporter, has lost market shares although it remains a notable exporter of cheese and SMP. In the case of WMP, Argentina is also an important exporter and is projected to account for 5% of world exports by 2032. In recent years, Belarus has become an important exporter, orienting its exports primarily to the Russian market due to the Russian embargo as of 2015 on several major dairy exporting countries. Figure 7.5. Exports of dairy products by region Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/fcuezv The European Union will continue to be the main world cheese exporter, followed by the United States and New Zealand. The United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, the European Union, and Saudi Arabia are projected to be the top five cheese importers in 2032. These countries are often also exporters of cheese and international trade is expected to increase the choice of cheeses for consumers. New Zealand remains the primary source for butter and WMP on the international market, and its market shares are projected to be around 40% and 60%, respectively, by 2032. China is the principal importer of WMP from New Zealand, but trade between the two countries is projected to be less dynamic over the projection period. The expected growth in domestic milk production in China will limit the growth in WMP imports. It is expected that New Zealand will diversify and slightly increase its production of cheese over the outlook period. The United States is expected to be the most dynamic large exporter over the next decade and expand SMP exports especially. This would require growth in drying capacity which is beyond current investments. SMP imports are disperse globally as it is often the easiest dairy product to trade for use in food processing. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 2020-22 2032 Butter Cheese Skim milk powder Whole milk powder Mt Rest of the World Argentina Australia European Union New Zealand United States 210  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Imports are spread more widely across countries, with the dominant destinations for all dairy products being the NENA, high-income countries, Southeast Asia, and China (Figure 7.6). China is expected to continue to be the world’s major dairy importer, especially for WMP with imports from China projected to represent 21% of global imports in 2032. Per capita consumption of dairy products in China is relatively low compared to traditional markets, but there have been significant increases in demand over the past decade, with growth projected to continue. Most of its dairy imports are sourced from Oceania, although in recent years the European Union has increased its exports of butter and SMP to China. While some regions are self-sufficient, such as India and Pakistan, total dairy consumption in Africa, Southeast Asian countries, and the NENA is expected to grow faster than production, leading to an increase in dairy imports. As liquid milk is expensive to trade (high volume/value ratio), this additional demand growth is expected to be met with milk powders, where water is added for final consumption or further processing. Imports by NENA are expected to originate primarily from the European Union, while the United States and Oceania are expected to be the main suppliers of powders to Southeast Asia. Figure 7.6.

Prices Real international dairy prices will trend downward International dairy prices are of processed products of the main exporters in Oceania and Europe. The two main reference prices are butter and SMP, where butter is the reference for milk fat and SMP for other milk solids. Milk fat and other milk solids together account for about 13% of the overall weight of milk, the remainder being water. Since 2015, the price of butter has increased considerably more than SMP. Increased demand for milk fat resulted in a price gap emerging between the two products and the price of butter will continue to be supported by stronger demand for milk fat compared to other milk solids on the international market. Therefore, the gap between the price of butter and SMP is assumed to remain a defining feature over the coming decade (Figure 7.7).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/mqa0jk The strong volatility of international dairy prices stems from its small trade share, the dominance of a few exporters, and a widely restrictive trade policy environment. Most domestic markets are only loosely connected to those prices as fresh dairy products dominate consumption, and only a small share of milk is processed as compared to that which is fermented or pasteurised. 7.4. Risks and uncertainties Environmental and health concerns are becoming more significant The role of plant-based replacements for dairy (e.g. soya, almond, rice, and oat drinks) in the fluid milk sector has increased in many regions, especially in North America, Europe and East Asia. Available replacements have continued to expand beyond the more traditional options, branching into various sources from nuts, legumes and other crops. Key drivers of the expansion include health and consumer concerns regarding the environmental impact of dairy production, and lactose intolerance. The growth rates of plant-based replacements for dairy products are strong, albeit from a low base, although the evidence regarding their environmental impact and relative health benefits is contested. The sustainability of popular replacements such as almond and soya drinks have been questioned as more consumers consider other environmental issues in addition to GHG emissions, such as water usage and deforestation. Similarly, lactose intolerance is a concern for some consumers with a range of lactose-free dairy products becoming available for those who do not prefer plant-based replacements. Overall, there is uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of plant-based replacements on the dairy sector. 1 000 2 000 3 000 4 000 5 000 6 000 7 000 2002200720122017 202220272032200220072012 2017202220272032 Nominal Price Real Price USD/t Butter Cheese Skim milk powder Whole milk powder 212  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Environmental legislation could have a strong impact on the future development of dairy production. GHG emissions from dairy activities make up a high share of total emissions in some countries (e.g. New Zealand and Ireland) and more stringent environmental policies and initiatives such as the Pathways to Dairy Net Zero launched in September 2021 by the dairy sector could affect the level and nature of dairy production to curb such emissions. The increasing trend towards sustainable practices such as water access and manure management are associated areas where policy changes could impact on dairy. European dairy sector experts assume decreasing dairy exports caused by the European Union Farm-to\u0002Fork-Strategy. Nevertheless, stricter environmental legislation could also lead to innovative solutions that improve the long-term competitiveness of the sector. Overall, the global level of GHG emissions will largely depend on efficiency gains in India and other countries with high cattle populations and extensive production. In addition, climate change and extreme weather events, already experienced in some countries and regions, could aggravate the viability of milk production in the affected countries. Russia’s war against Ukraine has significantly heightened the uncertainty of energy, fertiliser and other agricultural supplies and may slow down economic growth. Market impacts could be felt in related sectors such as dairy through increased input costs for these products. It could also increase the interest in circular agriculture with a focus on using fewer external inputs, an option available and widely used in dairy production. Changes in domestic polices remain an uncertainty. Under USMCA, Canada has capped SMP exports, allowed increased market access, and eliminated their Class 7 designation, which was initially introduced to comply with the World Trade Organization Nairobi Decision on the removal of export subsidies. In the European Union, intervention buying of SMP and butter at fixed prices remains possible under certain circumstances, and this already had a considerable market impact in recent years. Dairy trade flows could be substantially altered by changes in the trade environment. Modifications to existing, or the creation of new, trade agreements would affect dairy demand and trade flows. In addition, India and Pakistan, the big dairy consuming countries, have not been integrated into the international dairy market as domestic production is projected to expand fast to respond to growing home demand. Future investment in cold chain infrastructure in these regions will contribute to an increase their degree of dairy self-sufficiency.  213 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Note 1 Fresh dairy products contain all dairy products and milk which are not included in processed products (butter, cheese, skim milk powder, whole milk powder, whey powder and, for few cases casein).

Projection highlights Fish production, consumption and trade will grow slower than in last decade Fish1 consumption for food is expected to grow over the next decade but at a slower rate than in the previous decade, largely due to a softening of demand in Asian countries, the main consumers of aquatic food. The slow-down in Asian countries reflects the already high per capita fish consumption levels on average, and increased competition from meats with a recovery in pig meat consumption in the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”). Apparent2food fish consumption per capita is expected to increase in all continents except Africa, the region with the fastest growing population. By 2032, apparent food fish consumption is projected to reach 21.2 kg per capita globally – up from 20.4 kg in the base period (average 2020-2022). Differences across continents will persist and increase, as the strongest growth is expected in Asia, which already has the highest per capita consumption. Conversely, a decline is projected in Africa where per capita consumption is the lowest. The share of food fish consumption in total fisheries and aquaculture production is expected to remain broadly stable at about 90% over the outlook period. The remaining 10% of production will be utilised for non-food purposes, primarily for fishmeal and fish oil. Fish prices will all decrease in real terms over the outlook period, down from the high levels reached in the base period (Figure 8.1). However, the subdued growth in fish production will prevent prices from falling significantly. Fish oil prices are expected to experience the greatest decline over the period, reflecting a downward correction from the exceptionally high levels in 2022. Despite stable supplies, fish oil prices grew by over 50% in 2022 compared with 2021, supported by the high prices of vegetable oils. The decrease in fishmeal prices in real terms is expected to be marginal and less than other categories over the outlook period due the ongoing tight supplies and strong demand. The world prices for traded fish, aquaculture species, and capture species are all expected to decrease at similar rates in real terms over the next decade. Figure 8.1.

This slowdown in growth reflects the impact of policy changes in China, which have slowed the expansion of production, the higher costs for inputs, particularly energy, and the assumption that 2032 will be an El Niño year leading to lower production, mainly in South America. Most of the additional production will be generated by the aquaculture sector. By 2032, aquaculture production is projected to account for 55% of total fish production, compared with 50% in the base period. On average, the capture fisheries sector will provide about 92 Mt of fish every year, with lower levels in the years of El Niño. 3 World production of fishmeal is expected to expand over the next decade with the proportion of fishmeal obtained from fish residues as the main driver, reflecting an increased capacity of the sector to utilize by-products. World production of fish oil is projected to rise at a rate similar to total fish production. Global trade of fish for human consumption is projected to continue growing over the coming decade, but at a slower rate than in the past decade. Asia, and to a lesser extent Europe, will be driving the expansion of exports. By 2032, Asia will account for 51% of all food fish exports compared with 47% in the base period. Exports from Africa, Oceania and America are projected to decline by 2032, reflecting the slowdown in production growth across these continents and the assumed El Niño in the case of the Americas. The European Union, the United States and China will remain the top three importers, with rising imports for the European Union and the United States, while Chinese imports are expected to decrease by 21% by 2032. This decline reflects the efforts China is making to meet increasing food demand through domestic production. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors are expected to face significant uncertainties over the coming decade. Capture fisheries production and related prices might be impacted by the recently concluded negotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on fisheries subsidies, but also by improved fisheries management. Climate change represents a source of both environmental and regulatory risk for the capture fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Finally, Russian Federation’s (hereafter “Russia”) war against Ukraine and the related sanctions will continue to impact fish trade given the Russia’s position as an important capture fisheries producer. 8.2. Current market trends Price surge supported by limited supply growth and increased demand from global recovery After a strong recovery in 2021, world fish production rose marginally in 2022 to an estimated 183 Mt. The rise in Asian production was partly offset by a reduction in Peruvian catches after a high production year in 2021. Higher production costs (energy and fuel) hampered profitability in the aquaculture and capture fisheries sectors, despite a significant rise in fish prices. Increased demand, driven by the global economic recovery following the COVID-19 recession, combined with supply disruptions, including geopolitical conflicts, and weather-related disasters, led to higher inflation in 2021 and 2022. According to the FAO Fish Price Index,4international fish prices were 19% higher in 2022 compared to 2021, following a 7% rise in 2021. The index peaked to 135 in June 2022 and since then has been on a downward trend. World food fish exports were marginally down in 2022 compared with 2021 and are estimated to have reached 42 Mt. Higher exports from Chile, Korea and India were partly offset by reduced exports from Peru, the European Union and Norway.  217 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 8.3. Market projections 8.3.1. Consumption Growth in fish consumption is expected to slow over the next decade Fish can be consumed in different forms for either food or non-food uses. Fish not consumed as food is processed into fishmeal and fish oil or serves other non-food uses, such as for ornamental fish, culturing, fingerlings and fry, bait, pharmaceutical inputs, and as direct feed for aquaculture, livestock and other animals. Over the next decade, the bulk of fisheries and aquaculture production is expected to continue to be directed to human consumption. It is projected that 90% of fish production will be consumed as food in 2032, compared with 88% in the base period (2020-22 average). This mainly reflects a reduction in the quantities of fish used for fishmeal and fish oil production due to the El Niño phenomenon, assumed to occur in 2032. At the global level, fish for human consumption is projected to continue rising but at a slower pace than that experienced in previous decades. This slowdown in growth is mainly due to sluggish production expansion, higher fish prices, in particular in the first years of the projection period, and to a softening of demand in some Asian countries. Fish for human consumption is projected to increase by 14% to reach 182 Mt by 2032, expanding on all continents. However, the magnitude of the rise will vary from one continent to another, reflecting different consumption baseline levels and population growth rates. Africa is projected to experience the strongest growth rate in fish available for food consumption by 2032 (+25%), and Europe the lowest (+4.6%). At +14%, Asia does not have the highest growth rate but is, by far, the largest fish consumer. Consequently, Asia will account for 74% of the additional fish consumed by 2032. China on its own will account for 34% of that additional volume. Aquaculture will provide a growing share of the total fish available for human consumption rising from 57% in the base period to 61% by 2032. World apparent food fish consumption is expected to increase over the next decade, reaching 21.2 kg in 2032 in per capita terms, up from an average of 20.4 kg in 2020-22 (Figure 8.2). The growth rate will be lower in the second half of the outlook period when fish prices will increase. In per capita terms, fish consumption will increase in all continents except Africa, where it is projected to decline from 9.8 kg in 2020-22 to 9.6 kg in 2032, with a larger decrease in Sub-Saharan Africa (down from 8.8 kg in 2020-22 to 8.3 kg in 2032). Nevertheless, rising incomes and near saturation in consumption levels of some Asian countries are leading to a more even evolution of fish consumption per capita across continents. The decline in the African per capita fish consumption will be relatively smaller than in the prior decade, while the rise in the Asian per capita fish consumption will be about half that of the prior decade. Middle-income countries will drive growth in apparent food consumption per capita over the outlook period, followed by high-income countries. However, low-income countries are expected to experience negative growth over the outlook period. Consumption of fishmeal and fish oil will be constrained by their generally stable production. Markets will continue to be characterised by the traditional competition between aquaculture and livestock for fishmeal, and between aquaculture and dietary supplements for direct human consumption for fish oil. The reduction in fishmeal use in feed rations, due to its high price and major innovation efforts, will continue to expand the market for oilseed meals in the aquaculture industry, where oilseed meal use is anticipated to reach about 11.4 Mt in 2032. China will be the country utilizing the highest quantity of fishmeal as feed with a share of 42% of total consumption in 2032. Fish oil is still expected to predominantly be used in aquaculture, but direct human consumption will remain an important market, where prices are generally higher. 218  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 8.2.

Production Aquaculture to drive production growth Global fish production (capture fisheries and aquaculture) is expected to increase to 202 Mt by 2032, up from 181 Mt in the base period (Figure 8.3). While global fish production is still increasing (+12% over the outlook period), the rate of growth is substantially lower than the 22% increase achieved over the previous decade. This is the consequence of a lower growth rate in the aquaculture sectors when compared to the previous decade. In general, the pattern of the previous decade where capture fisheries production remained broadly stable while aquaculture production grew is expected to continue. Capture fisheries production is projected to grow marginally, reaching 91 Mt by 2032, an increase of just under one Mt. However, this slow growth is partly influenced by the assumed El Niño event in 2032, which reduces capture fishery production in South America, resulting in world capture production falling by about 2 to 3 Mt in these periods. Growth in capture fisheries production is expected to come largely from improved fisheries management, from technological improvements and reduction of discards and waste. The bulk of production will originate from Asian countries, which share in world capture fisheries is expected to rise slightly to 53% by 2032. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 World Africa America Oceania Europe Asia kg/person/year 2010-12 2020-22 2032  219 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 8.3.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/2cx90j The vast majority (96%) of additional growth in global fish production will originate from increasing aquaculture production. Aquaculture production is projected to be 111 Mt by 2032, an increase of 22% (or +20 Mt) relative to the base period, compared with 55% (or +33 Mt) in the previous decade. This anticipated slowdown in aquaculture production growth will be mainly caused by continued lower productivity gains related to environmental regulations, animal diseases related to high stocking densities and a reduced availability of optimal production locations. China, in particular, is expected to experience a substantial slowing of growth in farmed fish production due to regulations aimed at increasing the sustainability of the sector and targeting growth in species for domestic consumers. Nevertheless, China will continue dominating world aquaculture production with an expected share of 56% in 2032, representing a marginal decline to the base period. The production of all species groups is projected to rise over the outlook period, though at different rates, resulting in a change in the composition of aquaculture production by 2032. The share of carp, the main farmed species, is expected to decline by 2032, while the share of all other species groups will rise. This represents the continuation of a downward trend that started in the late 1990’s and corresponds, particularly in China, to the diversification of production largely in response to local demand. It is worth noting that the share of China in total carp production is projected to decline, reflecting stronger growth in other countries such as India. The shares of shrimps and prawns and of freshwater and diadromous fish (excluding tilapia and salmonoids the shares of which are projected to remain broadly stable) will increase. Over the next decade, it is expected that the quantity of capture fisheries production for fishmeal and fish oil will fluctuate between lows of 15.9 Mt in El Niño years and highs of 18.3 Mt in the best fishing years. This represents a drop compared to an average quantity of wild fish used for reduction of 26 Mt in the 1990’s. In parallel, the use of fish residue and by-products to produce fishmeal and fish oil is anticipated to continue increasing as growing market demand for fillets results in more residues being produced (Figure 8.4). The absolute level of world fishmeal and fish oil produced will reach 5.4 Mt and 1.3 Mt (in product weight) respectively in 2032, with a corresponding growth of 4.0% and 11%, compared to the base period. A notable consequence of the relatively limited ability for fishmeal production to increase and the continued growth of aquaculture is that oilseed meals are increasingly used to make up the shortfall in aquaculture feed.

Fishmeal and fish oil are expected to be used selectively at specific stages of production, such as for hatchery, brood stock and finishing diets as considered the most nutritious and most digestible ingredients for farmed fish.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/n1p96o 8.3.3. Trade Over half of the food fish imports will continue to be concentrated in high-income countries According to the projections, aquatic products (for food and non-food items) will remain highly traded, with about 33% of total fish production including intra-EU trade (30% excluding intra-EU trade) exported in 2032, reflecting the sector’s degree of openness to, and integration in, international trade. The aquaculture and capture fisheries supply chain is expected to remain complicated as aquatic products often cross national borders several times before final consumption due to the outsourcing of processing to countries with relatively lower labour and production costs. World trade of fish for human consumption is projected to be 5.0% higher in 2032 than in the base period. This represents a slowdown compared to the 10% growth observed in the previous decade. High transportation costs, slower expansion of fish production and desire to fulfil domestic demand with local production in some key countries, including China, are the main drivers behind this slowdown in growth. By 2032, exports of fish for human consumption are projected to reach 44 Mt, up from 42 Mt in the base period. By 2032, upper middle-income countries are the only income class expected to experience an increase in its share of global food fish exports, increasing to 48% from 44% in the base period. High-income countries will account for 31% of total food fish exports by 2032, lower middle-income countries for 18%, and low\u0002income countries for the remaining 4% (Figure 8.5). China will consolidate its leading role as the major exporter of fish for human consumption, with a share of 22% of world exports in 2032 (up from 17% in 2020-22), followed by Norway and Viet Nam (stable at 7% and 6%, respectively). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 2000-02 2010-12 2020-22 2032 % Fishmeal from fish residues Fish oil from fish residues  221 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 8.5.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1lrkbn The share of lower middle-income countries in global food fish imports is set to rise over the outlook period, while that of upper middle-income countries will decline. By 2032, the shares of food fish imports of lower middle-income and upper middle-income countries are expected to reach 15% and 26% of world food fish imports respectively, from 12% and 29% respectively in the base period. This trend reflects the rise in income in lower middle-income countries allowing them to increase their access to international markets. It also reflects the relocation of the fish processing industry from upper middle-income countries, such as China, to countries with relatively lower production costs, such as India, Indonesia or Viet Nam, thus leading to a rise in imports of raw material in lower middle-income countries. The share of high-income countries in world food fish imports will remain stable at 56% during the next decade. High-income countries will continue to be highly dependent on imports of fish for human consumption to meet their demand. By 2032, food fish imports are projected to account for 75% of total fish consumption in high\u0002income countries. In 2032, exports of fishmeal are projected to reach 3.3 Mt product weight, a quantity comparable to the one observed in the base period. However, it is worth noting that 2032 is assumed to be an El Niño year, leading to lower fishmeal production and trade. Peru will remain the leading exporter of fishmeal, with a share of global exports oscillating between 26% and 34% depending on the presence or not of the El Niño phenomenon. China is expected to have a 55% share of world fishmeal imports by 2032, increasing from 46% in 2020-22, to satisfy the needs of its aquaculture and pig industries. Fish oil exports are expected to increase slightly to 0.9 Mt product weight by 2032. With a combined share of 44%, the European Union and Norway will remain the main importers of fish oil, reflecting the use of fish oil for salmon farming and as a dietary supplement for human consumption. 8.3.4. Prices Prices are expected to decline slightly but remain high over the projection period Prices across all categories increased in 2022 as the ongoing economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continued to drive strong demand combined with the general inflationary environment. In nominal terms, the prices of all product groups are expected to decline until 2026 before continuing to rise again as demand stabilises in the wake of the COVID-19 recovery. Prices will decline over the projection 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 2010-12 2020-22 2032 2010-12 2020-22 2032 Exports Imports % High-income Upper middle-income Lower middle-income Low-income 222  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 period but will remain high relative to historic levels across all product groups. Real prices, however, will fall across all product groups in the projection period, in part due to increased competition from other protein sources (Figure 8.1). The prices of both capture fisheries and aquaculture products are impacted by increased competition from other protein sources, predominantly pig meat and poultry. Increased production and falling prices of other protein sources will lead to a softening of demand and reduced prices of both aquaculture and capture fisheries products in real terms. However, aquaculture production growth is expected to be slower than the previous decade (see production section), limiting the expected price decline across the projection period. Capture fisheries prices are expected to grow 19% (+1.1% p.a.) in nominal terms. However, in real terms this equates to a decline of 6.6% (-0.9% p.a.). This differs from the previous decade where prices grew by 27% in nominal terms and 1.8% in real terms. As with other product groups the growth in prices over the previous decade is an artefact of strong growth in prices following the COVID-19 pandemic in the base period. In nominal terms, prices are expected to decline from the high point in 2022 until 2026 before returning to growth from 2027. In real terms, capture fisheries prices will follow a similar pattern, but will continue to decline after 2027, albeit at a slower rate than between 2022 and 2026. Aquaculture prices are expected the follow similar patterns to capture fisheries, with nominal growth of 16% (+1.5% p.a.), and real declines of 9.0% (-0.5% p.a.). Growth in aquaculture prices is projected to be significantly lower than the previous decade when prices grew 41% in nominal terms and 13% in real terms. As with capture fisheries, the price trend is characterised by a decline between 2022 and 2026 as prices come down from COVID-19 recovery driven highs, followed by growth from 2027 to 2032. Unlike capture fisheries, growth in prices is expected in both nominal and real terms in the second half of the projection period. Fish oil prices are expected to grow by 9.2% (+1.7% p.a.) in nominal terms but in real terms are expected to decline by 14% (-0.3% p.a.), the greatest decline seen in all product groups. This decline is in part due to the exceptionally high prices in the base period when the fish oil price grew by over 50% in 2022 compared with 2021, despite stable supplies and was caused by the very high price of vegetable oils. The exceptionally high prices in 2022, mean the price of fish oil in 2032 is projected to be below the 2022 price in both nominal and real terms, despite continued strong demand as a feed input for aquaculture and for human consumption. The decline in prices contrasts strongly with the previous decade where prices grew by 102% (+2.8% p.a.) in nominal terms and 63% (+0.9% p.a.) in real terms. Fishmeal prices are expected to grow by the largest amount in nominal terms, 26% (+1.3% p.a.), and experience the smallest decline in real terms, -0.6% (-0.7% p.a.). The marginal decline in fishmeal prices reflects ongoing tight supplies and strong demand, bolstered by an increase in demand for fishmeal relative to other protein meals in aquaculture production. 8.4. Risks and uncertainties Environmental uncertainty and regulatory risks could significantly impact fish production The fisheries and aquaculture sectors will continue to face significant uncertainties over the next decade, including challenges related to the environment, policy changes and effectiveness of governance. While much of the production growth is expected to come from aquaculture, shifting government policies, particularly related to environmental impacts could alter the distribution and rate of growth. Any policy shifts in China, the world’s largest producer of both aquaculture and capture fisheries, will have significant impacts on global production and the 15th Five-Year plan 2026-2030 represents a source uncertainty for the second half of the projection period.  223 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Climate change will have both direct and indirect impacts on both capture fisheries and aquaculture and is perhaps one of the largest sources of uncertainty for fish production over the next decade, which is difficult to capture in the projections. The direct impacts of climate change on capture fisheries include the shifting geographic distribution of stocks, and changes to species composition, turnover, abundance and diversity in marine ecosystems. Climate change will not only impact the resources available to fishers, but also complicate the job of fisheries managers, and increase the number of shared stocks heightening the need for co-operative management regimes. On aquaculture, climate-driven changes in temperature, precipitation, ocean acidification, incidence and extent of hypoxia and sea level rise, availability of wild seed as well as reducing precipitation leading to increasing competition for freshwater, amongst others, are expected to have long-term impacts. The impacts of climate change will not be evenly distributed, with larger changes expected in tropical regions when compared to temperate zones. Climate change also creates several regulatory risks for both capture fisheries and aquaculture. As governments come under increasing pressure to reduce GHG emissions from the food system and transition to net zero, the prices of key energy inputs into capture fisheries (e.g. diesel fuel) and aquaculture (e.g. electricity) may change altering the profitability of some activities, with impacts on the types of production and the structure of the fleet. The impact of those policies on the agricultural markets is another source of uncertainty. The risks posed by the transition to net zero depends on both the energy intensity of production and the nature of the policies put in place, making them both hard to predict and heterogenous across countries and fleet segments. To help governments understand these challenges and share best practices the OECD has two new initiatives: one related to the impacts of climate change on policy making for capture fisheries and, another looking at the role of aquaculture can play in meeting the challenges faced by food systems globally. To help vulnerable states mitigate the often-devastating effects of climate change, the FAO Blue Transformation can provide a pathway for hunger reduction and sustainable management of oceans, seas, and marine resources through reconciling environmental sustainability, food security and livelihood priorities. The Blue Transformation focuses on more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable blue food systems, from both capture fisheries and aquaculture, promoted through improved policies and programmes for integrated science-based management, technological innovation, and private-sector engagement. It has three main objectives: sustainable aquaculture expansion and intensification; effective management of all fisheries; and upgraded value chains. Achieving the objectives of Blue Transformation requires holistic and adaptive approaches that consider the complex interaction between global and local components in food systems and support multi-stakeholder interventions to secure and enhance livelihoods, foster equitable distribution of benefits and provide for an adequate use and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems. In 2022, the international community agreed binding discipline on fisheries subsidies at the WTO, and its application represents another source of uncertainty for capture fisheries production. The agreement inter alia prohibits subsidies to fishing activity on overfished stocks, to illegal unreported and unregulated fishing and, to fishing on the high seas outside the area of competence of an RFMO. An analysis of government support to fisheries presented in the OECD Review of Fisheries 2022 suggests that over 60% of support (2018-2020 average) presents a high or moderate risk of encouraging unsustainable fishing in the absence of effective management. This suggests that when the WTO agreement enters into force (once two-thirds of members have accepted the agreement), the impacts on capture fisheries production may be significant if governments are required to alter their subsidy programmes to ensure compliance. The agreement also contains provisions for adopting more comprehensive disciplines within four years of the initial agreement entering into force, potentially resulting in another, more stringent, set of disciplines being applied in the projection period, introducing further uncertainties. Finally, from a trade perspective, future policy decisions could impact the projections. For example, while sanctions remain in place on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, any changes to this situation are difficult to predict and may impact the expected trading relationships. Ongoing tensions between the United 224  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 States and China, may have increasing impacts on the trade in fisheries products, particularly if trade and fishing activities in the Pacific are affected. The imposition of sanctions, tariffs and trade restrictions over the long term could alter established markets, leading to reduction in trade and higher consumer prices in some regions.

Projections cover consumption, production, trade and prices for ethanol and biodiesel. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key risks and uncertainties which could have implications for world biofuel markets over the next decade. 9 Biofuels 226  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 9.1. Projection highlights Policies and global transport fuel are key drivers in biofuel markets Biofuel use will continue to be largely driven by transport fuel demand and domestic support policies. Global transport fuel use in this Outlook is based on the IEA World Energy Outlook which foresees a reduction in many high-income countries, while increasing in low-income countries. Middle-income countries are predicted to take the lead in biofuel market expansion through the implementation of blending mandates and availability of subsidies for domestic production and blended fuel use. Global biofuel use is projected to expand substantially over the next decade (Figure 9.1). In the United States, the largest biofuel producer, biofuel demand is expected to remain strong thanks to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) regime. While ethanol consumption is anticipated to remain relatively flat over the projection period, biodiesel (including renewable diesel) is expected to be the major contributor to global growth, due to the increasing targets for state and federal renewable fuel programs and biomass-based diesel tax credits, which have been extended through 2024 under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In the European Union, the RED II (Renewable Energy Directive) has classified palm oil-based biodiesel as a high ILUC (Indirect Land Use Change) risk category and as a result the use of palm oil-based biodiesel is expected to decrease slightly reducing total biodiesel use in the European Union. Nevertheless, the share of biodiesel in total diesel use is expected to grow over the coming decade. The Clean Fuel Regulations in Canada are projected to lead to biofuel consumption in the country being twice as high in 2032 compared to today. Transport fuel consumption is expected to expand in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay over the coming years, with ethanol and biodiesel usage projected to increase accordingly. Indonesia's blending rate is assumed to stay above 30% (B30), while diesel and biodiesel use is set to rise. In South and Southeast Asian nations, biodiesel is expected to become more popular due to the growth in transport fuel demand and industrial use. In India sugarcane-based ethanol is projected to contribute significantly towards the goal of achieving an ethanol blend rate of 16% by 2025, whereas the E20 target would be met by 2032. Figure 9.1.

Biodiesel  227 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The production of biofuel is expected to remain largely reliant on first generation feedstocks such as maize and sugarcane to produce ethanol and vegetable oil for biodiesel. Used cooking oil (UCO) based biodiesel production is projected to gain importance in the European Union, United States, and Singapore. Governments have implemented policies mainly designed to reduce the national carbon footprint, decrease the dependency on fossil fuels, and support domestic agricultural producers. Production support and mandated use usually result in self-sufficient domestic markets, leaving only a small international market. The Outlook projects that by 2032, the amount of biodiesel traded internationally will decrease from 13% to 11% of total production, while the amount of ethanol traded internationally will drop slightly to 7% of total production. The outlook for international biofuel prices expects an adjustment period of two years in which prices return from their peaks in 2022 back to normal levels. Thereafter, a rise in nominal terms throughout the forecast period is expected, with a slight decline in real terms for ethanol and a slight increase for biodiesel. Prices of biofuels continue to be determined by a mix of fundamental factors, such as feedstock costs, crude oil prices, distribution costs, and government policies, such as production subsidies, consumer tax credits, and blending regulations. The policy context, largely determined by energy and environmental issues, is an important source of uncertainty in the projections for the transportation sector. The Outlook does not anticipate a significant increase in advanced biofuels, such as cellulose-based ethanol or HVO-based biodiesel, over the outlook period. Renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production could potentially rise stronger than anticipated in this Outlook in the long run, yet its success depends on technological progress, mandated use, and the availability of sustainable feedstock. A long-run uncertainty is the global electric vehicle (EV) stock that has many underlying factors, including consumer preferences, technology, resource availability, policy or indirect fuel market effects. The use of these vehicles has been growing since the mid-2000s. To date, more than 20 countries have announced plans to gradually eliminate internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales in the next 10-30 years. Numerous countries have introduced targets for EV deployment, as well as other initiatives to boost EV utilisation and research and development. In addition, the current instability in the energy and oil sectors is causing governments to prioritize self-sufficiency in energy supply, with biofuels seen as a key component to reduce vulnerability to global markets. As a result, uncertainty in the projections is influenced by the assumptions made about future developments in the transportation sector. Unexpected improvements in technology, together with potential changes in government regulations, could result in substantial variations from the current market projections for biofuels. 9.2. Current market trends Biofuels (bioethanol and biodiesel1) are fuels produced from biomass. The Outlook defines biodiesel to also include renewable diesel SAF. Currently, about 60% of ethanol is produced from maize, 23% from sugarcane, 7% from molasses, 3% from wheat, and the remainder from other grains, cassava or sugar beets. About 70% of biodiesel is based on vegetable oils (14% rapeseed oil, 23% soybean oil, and 29% palm oil) and used cooking oils (25%). More advanced technologies based on cellulosic feedstock (e.g. crop residues, dedicated energy crops, or woody biomass) account for small shares of total biofuel production. International biofuel sectors are strongly influenced by national policies that have three major goals: farmer support, reduced GHG emissions, and/or increased energy supply and independence. In 2022, biofuels consumption increased, offsetting the decrease caused by the drop of global transport fuel use during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought restrictions on people's movements, as well as disruptions in trade logistics all over the world. The ethanol market nearly came back to levels observed in 2019. The biodiesel market was less affected by the pandemic, due to the higher blending requirements, tax credits, direct subsidies and decarbonisation initiatives which made up for the lower total diesel 228  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 consumption. While biofuels world prices increased owing to higher cost of production through higher costs of feedstock (vegetable oil, maize, sugarcane, and molasses) and labour, oil price increases exceeded those witnessed in the biofuels markets, thus sustaining the incentives to continue and even expand the use of biofuels.

Consumption and Production Asian countries are driving biofuel supply and demand Globally, the Outlook expects biofuel consumption and production to increase at a much slower pace (1.3% p.a.) during the projection period than in previous decades primarily as result of policies not increasing support in developed countries. This slowdown is particularly significant for biodiesel consumption which grew by more than 7% p.a. over the past decade. Nonetheless, demand for biofuels is expected to increase due to developments in transportation fleets in some countries where total fuel consumption is still projected to increase and domestic policies that favour higher blends. Figure 9.2 shows that the share of biofuels in total transport fuels increases almost for all major producers except for biodiesel in Indonesia where it remains stagnant. Five countries account for 80% to the increase in global biofuel consumption. For biodiesel, those are the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil, and for ethanol they are Brazil, India and Canada (Figure 1.1)  229 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 9.2.

Most of gasoline will continue to be used for 10% ethanol blend (E10). Some growth is projected in 15% ethanol blend (E15), but infrastructure, technology and other constrains limit the mid-high-level blending. The ethanol blend rate limit is projected to increase to 11% by 2032. Ethanol production and consumption are expected to increase slightly relative to the base period (Figure 1.1). Maize is assumed to remain the main feedstock for ethanol production, accounting for 99% of production in 2032. Cellulosic ethanol production capacity is assumed to increase, albeit from a still low initial level. Although the United States should maintain its position as the world’s largest ethanol producer, its share of global production should decrease from 46% to 40%. Biodiesel production is projected to increase by 2.7% p.a. in the coming decade. This is driven by increased renewable diesel consumption due to the higher targets for state and federal renewable fuel programs and biomass-based diesel tax credits, which have been extended through 2024 under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The United States is projected to increase its share in global biodiesel production from 18% in the base period to 24% in 2032. This is also sustained by import demand for renewable diesel from Canada to comply with their clean fuel targets. European Union Since 2010, EU legislation related to biofuel support has been based on the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (RED), which required that at least 10% of transport energy use in EU Member States should be based on renewables by 2020. In 2018, agreement was reached to increase the transport sector target to 14%, with national caps on food and feed crop-based biofuels at 1 percentage point above 2020 levels, but not exceeding 7%. A new framework was adopted under Directive 2018/2001. RED II entered into force in 2021 to be implemented by 2030.2 RED II set a new overall renewable energy target of 32% by 2030. It classified palm oil-based biodiesel under a high ILUC risk category and thus consumption of this source as biodiesel feedstock is expected to decline. For the European Union, total fuel transport use projections are taken from the EU Agricultural Outlook 2022-32 where fuel use is projected to decrease for both diesel and gasoline. However, this downward trend is not expected for biofuel consumption. Biodiesel use is assumed to remain at similar levels as in the base year and ethanol consumption is expected to increase. This implies that the share of biodiesel in total diesel increases from 10% in 2022 to 13% and the share of ethanol in gasoline use would reach 8.7% compared to 6.3% in 2022. As to consumption, biodiesel production remains overall stable, although the share that is produced from palm oil, in view of sustainability considerations, will decrease from 21% to 8% in 2032. Biodiesel production from used cooking oils is projected to increase by 1.5% p.a., albeit a much slower rate than the past decade given availability constraints of this feedstock. Responding to the demand projections for the biodiesel sector, the European Union is expected to remain the world’s largest biodiesel producing region in 2032 although global production shares are expected to decrease from 32% to 26%. Brazil Brazil has a large fleet of flex-fuel vehicles that can run on either gasohol (a mix of gasoline and anhydrous ethanol, also called gasoline C) or on pure hydrous ethanol. For gasohol, the ethanol blend rate ranges between 18% and 27%, depending on the price relationship between domestic sugar and ethanol. The current percentage requirement for ethanol is legislated at 27%. Due to the fuel tax exemptions in 2022 as well as easing gasoline prices in the second half of the year, consumers have purchased more gasoline at the pump, benefiting anhydrous inclusion, but to the detriment of hydrous ethanol. The biodiesel blending target is 15% but has been reduced to 10% since 2021. For 2023 Brazil's National Energy Policy Council announced its gradual return to 15% by 2026, which the Outlook assumes to be maintained until 2032. For the coming decade it is assumed that Brazilian ethanol consumption will increase by 2.5% p.a., sustained by the RenovaBio programme.3 This programme, signed in January 2018, is intended to reduce the emissions intensity of the Brazilian transport sector in line with the country’s commitments under  231 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 COP21. Brazilian ethanol production is projected to increase with a similar pace as consumption. While the Outlook assumes that sugarcane will remain the main feedstock for ethanol, maize, which increased over the past five years from below 0.3 bln L to over 4.4 bln L, is assumed to gain greater shares in the feedstock mix and reach almost 7 bln L by 2032. In contrast to the United States and the European Union, total fuel consumption of gasoline and diesel in Brazil is projected to increase over the coming decade, underpinning the potential growth of blending biofuels to gasoline and diesel. Consequently, the Outlook projects ethanol and biodiesel consumption increasing respectively by 2.5% p.a. and 1.6% p.a. in Brazil. Indonesia The implementation of B30 (Biodiesel 30% blend) aims at reducing the country’s dependency on imported fossil fuels, stabilising palm oil prices, reducing GHG emissions and sustaining the domestic economy as it accounts for nearly half a million jobs in the country. In recent years, biodiesel production has steadily increased due to a national biodiesel programme, which provides support to biodiesel producers, and it is financed by the crude palm oil (CPO) fund which is fed by the levy imposed on CPO exports. In 2021, the CPO fund revenue stood at around USD 4.9 billion of which about USD 3.5 billion was allocated to subsidize biodiesel. Nonetheless, owing to external factors such as the economic crisis related to COVID\u000219, the government set rules restricting CPO exports aiming at alleviating domestic food price inflation. In the second half of 2022, such restrictions were lifted as CPO inventories were accumulating. To stimulate exports, the export levy was set up temporally at zero with a view to increase it once the reference price exceeds USD 800 per metric tonne. The Outlook assumes producer prices to stay above the reference price over the projection period, thus allowing the replenishment of the CPO fund that will not only allow to continue subsidizing domestic biodiesel production but to increase the blend at 35%. At the same time, the level of the subsidy relies to some extent on the cost of fossil fuels and oil prices increasing over the projection period will help to reduce the subsidy per unit of biodiesel. Based on these assumptions, biodiesel production in Indonesia is projected to increase to 12.4 bln L by 2032. However, in view of the EU environmental regulation and declining use of diesel in high-income countries, exports are projected to remain negligible over the outlook period. India India has accelerated ethanol production aiming to achieve the ambitious target of E20 (Ethanol 20% blend) by 2025 rather than 2030. However, the Outlook foresees limitations on feedstock supplies being able to increase biofuel production to reach the target levels over the outlook period. While the Outlook assumes molasses and sugar cane juice would remain as the primarily feedstocks, other crops such as rice, wheat and other coarse grains will help to accelerate domestic production. Sugar mills are investing and developing the capacity to produce ethanol from sugarcane juice as sugar cane is aided by soft loans. In 2022, it is estimated that about 25% of ethanol was produced by sugar cane, and this share could increase to nearly 55% by 2032. However, given accelerating gasoline demand, the blending rate could reach 16% in 2025 and 20% in 2032. Ethanol production is expected to be 13 bln L in 2032. The limited supply of vegetable oils, for which India is a net importer, in combination with high international prices will remain the main constrains to significantly increase biodiesel production. China The biofuel policies of the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”) have been volatile in the past years, which constrained significant consumption growth. Despite President Xi's pledge to achieve a peak in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, no mention has been made of the role of biofuels in this context. The Outlook assumes that the ethanol blending rate which was around 1.2% in recent years will increase to 1.7% in 2032. This increase compensates for the projected decrease of total gasoline use sustaining an 232  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 ethanol consumption growth of 1.1% p.a. over the next decade. Similarly, biodiesel consumption is projected to increase 2% p.a. The Outlook assumes most of the ethanol demand will be produced from domestic feedstock. Argentina In 2022, biodiesel production recovered further after the COVID-19 pandemic caused a decrease in diesel demand, with domestic utilization more than making up for decreases in exports to the European Union. There were no announcements made for new investments in biofuel capacities in 2022. However, in June 2022, the government resolved to increase the biodiesel mandate from B5 to B7.5 but allowing it to be temporarily increased as high as B12.5 to be able to respond to diesel shortages. The Outlook assumes B7.5 as blending target and with limited additional export possibilities, biodiesel production is projected to increase only marginally over the next decade. Ethanol blending has been maintained at 12% despite a push from bioethanol producers to have the blending target increased to 15%. The Outlook assumes the rate to remain at this12% target and with total gasoline use projected to increase, ethanol fuel use is projected to increase 0.8% p.a. Thailand In spite of the targets set in the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) for sugar cane (and indirectly molasses) and cassava, limited domestic availability is expected to constrain biofuels production. In addition, stagnating demand for fossil fuels will limit increasing demand for ethanol. On average, blending is expected to reach 14% over the outlook period and production is projected to increase marginally to 2 bln L in 2032. Biodiesel demand is expected to be supported by mandatory blending. However, palm oil supply and high vegetable oil prices will constrain both domestic supply and demand to an increase of 2.2 bln L by 2032. Colombia Ethanol demand is projected to increase over the outlook period in line with the recovery of gasoline demand. Due to local supply shortages, the government decreased the ethanol blend rate to 4% between April and September 2021, with the average blending rate in 2022 about 8%. Over the medium term, the blending rate is projected to return to 10%. The Outlook assumes sugarcane to continue as the main feedstock. In 2032 biofuels use will account for about 35% of sugarcane production from 22% in the base period, thus consolidating ethanol as an important element in sustaining the Colombian sugarcane industry. Biodiesel demand was subdued in 2019 and 2020 due to a decline in diesel demand, but in 2021 and 2022 the blending rate reached 12%. The Outlook assumes this level will continue and production is projected to reach 0.9 bln L by 2032. Other countries Other relatively important producers of ethanol include Paraguay, the Philippines, and Peru, where production could reach 0.8 bln L, 0.6 bln L and 0.3 bln L, respectively by 2032; the blending rate in these three countries is assumed to remain stable at around 30%, 10% and 7%, respectively. Malaysia, the Philippines and Peru are also major biodiesel producers, where production could reach 1.7 bln L, 0.3 bln L and 0.3 bln L, respectively, by 2032. In Malaysia, blending is projected to remain around 10%, whereas in Peru and the Philippines it will be around 5% and 4%, respectively. Other Asian countries, in particular Singapore, would increase production to reach around 1.4 bln L of biodiesel from used cooking oil in 2032. Unlike most countries where biofuels are domestically used to reduce GHG emissions and to reduce national dependency on imported oil, production of biodiesel in Singapore is largely exported.  233 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 9.3.2. Trade Global Biofuel trade is stagnating World ethanol trade is projected to increase from 10 bln L in the base period to 12 bln L in 2032, while the total share of production will remain constant at 8%. The United States and Brazil are expected to remain the main exporters of maize- and sugarcane-based ethanol. The export share of both countries together is expected to remain at about 70%, but the United States will gain some export shares from Brazil where increases in domestic biofuel use hamper export growth. Globally, biodiesel trade accounts for 13% of production and is projected to decrease from 7.6 bln L to 7.3 bln L by 2032 with its share in production falling to 11%. Indonesian biodiesel exports fell dramatically in 2020 and have since remained low. Reflecting high domestic demand, the Outlook does not expect Indonesia to return with biodiesel exports to international markets. The top 5 exporters of biodiesel, China, the European Union, Argentina, the United States and Malaysia, are projected to decrease their market share from 75% in the base period to 73% in 2032, with Argentina taking over second position from the European Union.

Risks and uncertainties Evolution of policies and relative prices are key risks The major risks and uncertainties for the future development of the biofuels sector are largely related to the policy environment, feedstock, and oil prices. Policy uncertainty concerns changes in mandate levels, enforcement mechanisms, investment in non-traditional biofuel feedstock, tax exemptions and subsidies for biofuels and fossil fuels, and policies promoting EV and SAF technology. The policy environment will remain uncertain because it crucially depends on agricultural feedstock and oil prices developments. Fossil fuel prices affect biofuel competitiveness and are thus linked to subsidies allocated to the biofuel sector. Oil markets have been very volatile in recent years and this tendency was further accentuated by the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine. Such extreme price swings in the energy markets have affected the structure of the biofuels market and could have a long-lasting effect. Another uncertainty arises from feedstuff supply. Traditionally, countries sought to use surplus commodities for biofuels so to not reduce food availability and threaten food security. As biofuels compete with food use and may require extra crop land, countries are cautious on expanding biofuel production at a faster pace. Nevertheless, blending mandates are expected to lead to more biofuel production in some emerging economies. Recent price spikes in the cereal and vegetable oil markets have revived the discussion around the ethics of fuel versus food, while some people struggle to obtain enough food. One possibility would be to use biofuel policies as a buffer in food price crises by, for example, reducing mandates for a period of time. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 2012201720222027203220122017202220272032 Nominal price Real price USD/hl Ethanol Ethanol feedstock Biodiesel Biodiesel feedstock  235 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The effectiveness of such an approach is yet to be proven but, even if implemented, would not alter the linear projections from the baseline. The global EV stock has been increasing since the mid-2000s. More than 20 countries have announced the complete phasing out of ICE vehicle sales and eight countries plus the European Union have announced net-zero emission vehicle pledges over the next 10-30 years.4 Many countries have introduced EV deployment targets, purchase incentives and other supporting programmes for increasing EV utilisation and promoting R&D for EV. However, recent events showed that policies supporting EV can be revoked or suspended. For example, China removed the effective subsidy for EV in January 2023. SAF consumption and production could increase in the long term but its success relies on technological advancements, ambitious policies and securing sustainable feedstock. Advances in technology and potential changes in the regulatory framework of the transport sector could result in substantial deviations from current market projections for biofuels. Countries are expected to adopt policies to advance the implementation of new technologies to cut greenhouse emissions, via blending mandates, subsidies, and tax reductions. All these measures transfer uncertainty in energy to agricultural markets and as a consequence, future biofuel demand is related to the response of the private sector to these measures. Industries currently investing in EV and SAF could, depending on the uptake of this technology and the policies supporting its adoption, considerably alter the use of biofuels over the next decade and beyond.

Projections cover consumption, production, trade and prices developments for cotton. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key risks and uncertainties which could have implications for world cotton markets over the next decade. 10 Cotton  237 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 10.1. Projection highlights Steady growth in the next decade Over the next decade, world consumption of raw cotton is foreseen to grow 1.8% p.a. on account of population and income growth in middle- and low-income countries. Raw cotton consumption will continue to depend on developments of demand in the textiles and apparels sectors and on competition from substitutes. It is expected that Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Viet Nam will lead the growth in consumption of lint cotton. The distribution of lint cotton use across the globe depends on the location of cotton mills, which are often located in proximity to clothing and apparel industries. Over the past decades, there has been a marked build-up of cotton milling capacity in Asia, and this trend is expected to persist during the next decade. Chinese consumption peaked in 2007, but has been declining since, as stricter labour and environmental regulations and rising labour costs have pushed the industry to other Asian countries, notably Viet Nam and Bangladesh. These countries have experienced strong growth of their textile industries in the past years and a further increase in their milling capacity is expected over the next decade, bolstered by large foreign investments. By contrast, Chinese mill consumption has remained constant since 2016 and the Outlook assumes stable consumption for the coming decade. In India, another major cotton consumer, the foreseen increase for textiles products is expected to result in continuous growth in cotton mill use. Over the next decade, global lint cotton production is projected to grow 1.81% p.a. to reach 28.1 Mt in 2032.This increase will be mostly dominated by higher yields (1.4% p.a.) and to a lesser extent on the expansion of area harvested (0. 4% p.a.). Yield growth is expected to be driven by improvements in genetics, better agricultural practices, new technologies, and digitalization supporting precision agriculture. These elements will significantly contribute to enhance productivity. Additionally, marginal increases in area harvested in the United States and Brazil will also contribute to enlarge cotton production. Overall, India and the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”) will continue to lead world cotton production, accounting for nearly 46% of the global output in 2032. Raw cotton, or lint, is internationally shipped in the form of large bales (about 225 kg) of highly compressed fibres, easing transportation. The Outlook foresees growth in global trade of lint of 15.8% compared to the base period, surpassing 11.9 Mt by 2032. Additionally, world trade is expected to grow at a slightly higher pace than overall consumption, considering that countries with a strong textile industry such as Bangladesh and Viet Nam rely heavily on raw material imports. The growing gap will be filled mainly by top producing countries, such as Brazil and the United States, where the lint industry is primarily export oriented. Overall, it is expected that the structure of the global cotton market will not change significantly in the coming decade, with Sub-Saharan Africa as a region remaining the third largest exporter of raw cotton in 2032, after United States and Brazil (Figure 10.1). International cotton prices, in real terms, are foreseen to trend slightly downward in the medium term. Productivity enhancement, as well as expected low prices of synthetic fibres will likewise impact cotton prices and exert downward pressure. Key uncertainties on the demand side can potentially impact outcomes. First, developments of the global economy might influence consumption of textile and apparel products, thus affecting the demand for cotton. Second, the stronger than expected competition from man-made fibres, notably polyester, can negatively affect demand for cotton. Third, the growing concerns by governments and consumers over the environmental impacts of the textile and clothing industry can result in tighter regulations and standards affecting cotton demand. 238  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 10.1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/mb4ow8 On the supply side, the main source of uncertainty is natural risks, including climate change and pest infestations. Policy also plays an important role in cotton markets. For example, changes in stockholding measures, input subsidies and market access can alter the performance of the sector. 10.2. Current market trends Increases in yields and areas are contributing to steady production growth Global raw cotton consumption is set to decline to its lowest level in ten years in the 2022/23 season (August/July). Major declines in lint demand are anticipated to be witnessed by some of the leading cotton consumers such as India and Pakistan. The expected drop in consumption reflects the global economic uncertainty and inflation surge, which is seen to decelerate global demand for cotton-related products. Furthermore, the US dollar appreciation against Asian currencies has exacerbated the drop in lint demand, considering that main raw-cotton consumers are highly dependent on imports. International cotton prices experienced important fluctuations in the 2022/23 season. The global economic rebound along with the upsurge of textiles demand from the previous season kept prices high until May 2022, when prices reached an eleven-year high. As a consequence of a slowing global demand for cotton from June 2022, cotton prices dropped significantly. Despite the decline, prices in 2022 averaged 38% above their year-earlier levels, prompting an increase in planted area in India and Brazil. Global cotton production slightly decreased in 2022 as a result of extreme weather conditions. In the United States, early season drought in Texas prompted a contraction of nearly 16% of lint production, whereas in Pakistan, late season flooding plunged local production to the lowest level in nearly 40 years. However, increases of cotton production in China and India, the world's foremost producers, did not offset the global shortfall. World trade of raw cotton is foreseen to decrease compared to the previous season. On the supply side, exports are expected to be significantly lower due to the underperforming season in the United States, the worlds’ larger exporter. On the demand side, weaker global textile consumption significantly reduced lint India 25% China 22% USA 15% Brazil 13% Pakistan 4% USA 33% Brazil 27% Sub-Sah-Afr 13% India 9% Australia 7% China 28% India 22% Pakistan 9% Bangladesh 8% Viet Nam 7% Bangladesh 18% Viet Nam 18% China 18% Türkiye 12% Indonesia 7% Other 29% Other 25% Other 12% Other 22% Production Exports Mill consumption Imports  239 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 imports in Viet Nam, Bangladesh, and Türkiye. Furthermore, in Pakistan, a sharp depreciation of local currency against the US dollar has shrunk imports, while China’s trade remained stable compared to the 2021/22 season. 10.3. Market projections 10.3.1. Consumption Viet Nam and Bangladesh displacing China in leading growth in consumption Cotton consumption refers to the use of cotton fibres by mills to transform it into yarn. Cotton mill-use depends largely on two major factors: global textile demand and competition from synthetic fibres. Over the past decades, global demand for textiles fibres has sharply increased, driven mainly by population and income growth, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This expanding demand has been largely supplied by chemical fibres (Figure 10.2, panel a). The diverse advantages of synthetics compared to cotton including durability, wrinkle resistance, moisture-wicking, and/or competitive prices have boosted textile manufacture industry to favour synthetic over cotton fibres. As a result, global consumption of natural fibres peaked in 2007 at 26,5 Mt and shrank to around 24,4 Mt in 2020-22. From the early 1990’s, non-cotton fibres have gained solid ground in the textile industry. In 2022, the end\u0002use market-share reached 76.7% for chemical fibres and only 23.3% for cotton. Likewise, per capita consumption of non-cotton fibres has strongly outpaced per capita consumption of cotton fibres and continues to strongly increase. In contrast, per capita consumption of cotton has remained stagnant over time and trended downwards in recent years (Figure 10.2, panel b) Figure 10.2. Historical trends in consumption of textile fibres Source: ICAC World Textile Demand estimates, 2023. StatLink 2https://stat.link/7eosu9 The prospects for global cotton use relies mainly on its evolution in developing and emerging economies. Demand from these regions with lower absolute levels of consumption but higher income responsiveness is projected to exert upward pressure on global demand for cotton as the incomes and population of these countries are projected to increase. As a result, the Outlook expects global growth consumption of cotton 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 1962 1972 1982 1992 2002 2012 2022 Mt Cotton Wool Chemical fibres 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 1962 1972 1982 1992 2002 2012 2022 kg/person Cotton Non-cotton a.

Correspondingly, global mill use is projected to grow by around 1.8% p.a. over the next decade. The geographical distribution of demand for cotton fibres depends on the location of spinning mills, where natural and synthetic fibres are transformed into yarn. Traditionally, the spun yarn industry has been established predominantly in Asian countries, where conditions such as lower labour costs are favourable for the industry. China has been the world’s leading cotton consumer since 1960. However, major changes in the geography of cotton production in China have reshaped global cotton markets in the last decade. With 90% of Chinese cotton currently produced in the region of Xianjiang and a tariff-rate quota binding mill-cotton imports, yarn production has gradually shifted to other Asian countries. China’s cotton mill consumption has been decreasing since the support price system was abolished in 2014. The artificially higher prices had caused a shift in demand from cotton to synthetic fibres. Likewise, the decline in cotton demand also reflects the structural change that took place as a result of higher labour costs and more stringent labour and environmental regulations. This provoked a move to other Asian countries, notably Viet Nam and Bangladesh. In recent years, mill consumption has regained some lost ground in China, in part because domestic cotton prices have become more competitive when compared to polyester, which appears to have suffered a setback due to government measures to combat industrial pollution. Chinese spinning mill use should remain stable over the next decade if margins are remunerative at the mills. In India, the growing textile industry coupled with competitive labour costs, and government support to the sector are expected to result in continuous growth in cotton mill use. Cotton plays an important role in the Indian economy as the country's textile industry is predominantly cotton based. The textile industry, however, faces several challenges, including technological obsolescence, high input costs, and poor access to credit. The government is promoting investments in the sector and has launched several schemes over the past few years for the promotion of the textile industry and improving the livelihood of the people involved. The phase-out in 2005 of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (which had fixed bilateral quotas for developing country imports into Europe and the United States) was expected to favour Chinese textile producers at the cost of smaller Asian countries. In practice, countries such as Bangladesh, Viet Nam, and Indonesia experienced strong growth of their textile industry based on an abundant labour force, low production costs, and government support measures. In addition, the escalation of the United States-China trade dispute has spurred additional mill use in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In the case of Viet Nam, this was partly driven by its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2007 and by foreign direct investment (FDI), notably by Chinese entrepreneurs. Structural changes in cotton production in China along with the surge of more robust textiles industries in Viet Nam, Bangladesh, and other central Asia economies, have boosted mill consumption growth in recent years and is foreseen to keep expanding over the coming decade. Viet Nam will take the lead in annual growth of mill use. The ratification of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union in mid\u00022020 is expected to contribute to this growth. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, growing demand for yarn and fabric from the domestic garment and textile industries is prompting investments in new spinning facilities or in enhancing production capacity of existing mills. Hence, cotton fibres consumption is expected to rise 3,4% p.a. and 3,2% p.a. accordingly.  241 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Figure 10.3.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/doghcj 10.3.2. Production Improvements in yields drive growth, but sustainable production remains the main concern Cotton is grown in subtropical and seasonally dry tropical areas in both the northern and southern hemispheres, although most of the world’s production takes place north of the equator. The leading producing countries are India, China, the United States, Brazil, and Pakistan. Jointly, these countries account for around 78% of global output in 2032 (Figure 10.1). Global production of cotton is expected to grow steadily and reach 28.-15 Mt by 2032, 12% higher than in the base period (Figure 10.4). The foreseen increase will mostly come from growth in the main cotton producers: United States will account for about 29% of the global increase, followed by India (25%), and China (7%). Overall, gains in cotton production are predominantly driven by higher yields, and to a lesser extent, on expansion in area harvested. Average global yields are projected to increase by 8% compared to the base period. Factors such as improvements in genetics, better agricultural practices, and digitalization supporting precision agriculture will significantly contribute to enhance productivity and sustainability. Over the past two decades, global average yields have been stagnant, suggesting static or decreasing yields in some of the major producers. For instance, in 2022, yields in China and Brazil were double the world average yields while India, the main cotton producer, remained well below (around 0.5 times global average yields). These differences are estimated to slightly broaden over the outlook period. (Figure 10.5, panel a).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/u84ks7 Production in India is estimated to grow by around 2.5% p.a. over the next decade, mainly on account of yield improvements rather than area expansion, since cotton already competes for acreage with other crops, such as soybeans and pulses. Raw cotton productivity has remained stagnant in recent years and is among the lowest globally. Cotton producers struggle with several obstacles such as adverse weather, pests, and diseases. Moreover, cotton is traditionally grown on small farms, which limits the adoption of intensive farming technologies. However, growing demand from the domestic apparel industry continues to spur investments in the sector and the Outlook assumes a growth in yields that reflects increased use 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 2002 2007 2012 2017 2022 2027 2032 Mt Rest of the World stocks (est.)

Nonetheless, climate change, with most cotton grown under rain-fed conditions, may undermine the yield growth potential. Chinese cotton is currently produced with the highest global yield (1.90 t/ha average in 2020-22), which are more than double of the world’s average. Over the past two decades, the cotton area in China has been declining, mostly due to changing government policies. Nevertheless, this trend seems to have slowed down since 2016. It is expected that the cotton area will decrease by 0.4% p.a. during the outlook period. In Brazil, cotton is grown in part as a second crop in rotation with soybeans or maize. Recently, output has strongly grown in the main cultivation areas such as Mato Grosso, where 70% of Brazilian cotton is currently harvested. Cotton output is foreseen to increase by 3.9% p.a. Production gains are mostly coming from higher yields and the use of genetically engineered (GE) seeds and fertilisers. Recent investments in cotton-growing capacity and the acquisition of new equipment (planters, pickers, and ginning capacity) are expected to boost production in the coming years. Due to strong competition with other crops, mainly soybeans, the planted area depends widely on the profitability of cotton compared to other commodities. Sustainability issues play an important role and will impact cotton markets in the medium term. In a context of growing concerns over the effects of climate change and socio-environmental considerations, new initiatives have been introduced to promote sustainability along the supply chain. Among the existing standards, Better Cotton dominates globally. In 2021, the combined cotton output from worldwide partners reached 20% of sustainable cotton with respect to global cotton production (Figure 10.6). Alternative strategies1 promote better agricultural practices to mitigate climate change and provides guidance to textile brands and retailers to source their cotton inputs from recognized and certified sustainable producers. It is expected that demand for more sustainable cotton continues to rise, driven by commitments from brands and awareness among young populations. Therefore, growing trends towards consumption of more sustainable cotton products will likely boost cotton production in countries such as Brazil, where around 84% of total cotton output already complies with the sustainable standards. It is expected that Sub-Saharan Region also benefits, as programmes such as Cotton Made in Africa (CMIA) accounts for 13% of global sustainable output. Figure 10.6.

Trade World cotton market relies strongly on trade, with Bangladesh and Viet Nam mill consumption depending on imports World cotton trade is projected to expand steadily over the next decade and reach 11.2 Mt in 2032, 16% higher than in the base period. The increase mainly reflects the substantial growth in mill use in Asian countries, particularly Viet Nam and Bangladesh, which source virtually all their cotton from imports to support their growing domestic textiles sector. By 2032, imports in China are projected to decrease by 7% reaching 2.0 Mt. Shifts in the location of the planting area that took place in the last decade have reshaped the Chinese cotton market. Due to the physical distances between the spinning and the cotton fields along with imposed tariff-rate quota on imports, the Chinese textile industry has substituted raw-cotton imports by yarn imports and from 2012-21, the latter increased at 21,7% p.a. As a result, lint demand has been absorbed by other Asian economies (Figure 10.7, panel b). The United States will remain the world’s largest exporter throughout the outlook period. Exports from the United States exports have stabilised in recent years, recovering from the lows in 2016. It is projected that its share of world trade will reach 33% in 2032 (around 3.6 Mt). Despite the major changes in the Chinese textile industry, the United States remains its main trade partner. It is foreseen that in the medium-term export volumes to China will fall, while slightly gaining ground across other Asian economies. Brazilian exports are expected to grow strongly over the next decade, consolidating the country’s position as the second largest exporter by 2032, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 10.7, panel a). In Sub\u0002Saharan Africa, cotton is an essential export crop, accounting for around 13% of global exports. Overall, cotton production in the region has increased in the past several years due to area expansion and improvements in yields. The region will remain subject to pests and disease that adversely affect cotton harvests. Figure 10.7.

Prices International cotton prices to decline in real terms over the medium-term International cotton prices in real terms are foreseen to trend slightly downward in the medium term (Figure 10.8). Prices will continue to be influenced by competition from man-made fibres along with changes in consumers preferences. From the early 1970s, when polyester became price-competitive, cotton prices tended to follow polyester prices. For example, cotton prices were only 5% above polyester staple fibre prices between 1972 and 2009. Since 2010, however, cotton prices have been on average almost 40% above the polyester price, in nominal terms. Over the past year, cotton prices increased at a faster pace than those of polyester, resulting in a wider price differential. However, it is assumed that the relative competitiveness between these two types of fibre will not change drastically over the projection period. Figure 10.8.

Risks and uncertainties Policies and the role of genetics constitute major concerns Economic growth and urbanisation will continue to be the main factors affecting the per capita demand for textiles in developing and emerging economies. Demand trends for textiles will significantly impact demand for cotton fibres. Since the consumption of textiles and apparel is more income responsive than the consumption of food commodities, deviations from the economic conditions assumed in the Outlook could lead to important changes in the global cotton consumption, production, and trade projections. 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 2002 2007 2012 2017 2022 2027 2032 USD/t Nominal Real 246  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 In the short term, projections are likely to be impacted by the increase in energy prices recorded in 2022. Additionally, current macroeconomic conditions are set to play an important role in short-term investment decisions, as current high inflation and increases in interest rates affect the cost of borrowing. Moreover, for Asian countries that are highly dependent on cotton imports, the appreciation of the US dollar against Asian currencies will also impact the cotton market in the near future. Other demand trends affecting the projections include recycling by the textile industry that is creating a competitive secondary market providing raw material to producers of lower quality textiles and non-textile products. This trend, along with stronger than expected competition from man-made fibres, could negatively affect demand for cotton. Growing concerns by governments and consumers over the environmental impacts of the textile and clothing could also affect demand for cotton, However, on the other hand, greater adoption of sustainability standards in supply chains could provide a stimulus to the demand for cotton. Like other crops, cotton production is sensitive to pests, disease, and climate change. The latter could lead to increasing frequency of droughts, floods, and other adverse weather conditions. As noted above, yield growth has been slow in several countries over the past two decades. Faster than expected improvements in genetics and gene editing (e.g. facilitated in part by a better understanding of the cotton genome) and better pest management have the potential to lead to higher yield growth than the projections in the Outlook. Such innovations, however, take time to develop and deploy, and in the case of genetically modified cotton are sometimes controversial. In Burkina Faso, the introduction of Bt cotton in 2008 was effective in combatting bollworms but resulted in a shorter staple length (and hence lower quality premiums). This prompted the government to phase out Bt cotton in 2015. Policies also play an important role in global cotton markets. Policies, beyond what is assumed in the Outlook, such as support for domestic textile industries or input subsidies might affect the resulting projections. Trade policies and geopolitical tensions also impact the development of lint markets. For instance, the current US-China dispute and the United States’ Uyghur forced labour prevention act2that went into effect in June 2022 have significant consequences and caused disruptions along the supply chain in China. Finally, issues associated with social, economic, and environmental sustainability (e.g. Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) and the Strategy for Sustainable circular textiles in the European Union) are becoming increasingly important for consumers, industry, and policy makers in many countries. Policy measures that affect consumption include, for example, the decision by several East African countries to increasingly discourage second-hand clothing imports. This could bolster cotton consumption and encourage more added value in Africa. In West Africa, efforts from the government and the private sector are being made to increase cotton processing capacities across countries.  247 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Notes 1 See https://bettercotton.org/who-we-are/our-aims-strategy/2030-strategy/ and https://textileexchange.org/2025- sustainable-cotton-challenge/. 2 The Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act forbids the import of goods produced in China’s Xianjiang region.

It then highlights the medium term (2023-32) projections for production, consumption and trade for these products and describes the main drivers of these projections. 11 Other products  249 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 11.1. Roots and tubers 11.1.1. Market overview Roots and tubers are plants that yield starch derived from either their roots (e.g. cassava, sweet potato and yams) or stems (e.g. potatoes and taro). They are destined mainly for human consumption (as such or in processed form) and, like most other staple crops, can also be used for animal feed or industrial processing, notably in the manufacturing of starch, alcohol, and fermented beverages. Unless they are processed, they are highly perishable once harvested, which limits the opportunities for trade and storage. Within the roots and tubers family, potato dominates in worldwide production, with cassava a distant second. With respect to global dietary importance, potato ranks fourth after maize, wheat and rice. This crop provides more calories, grows more quickly, uses less land, and can be cultivated in a broad range of climates. However, potato production, which forms the bulk of the root and tuber sectors in developed countries, has been declining over several decades, with growth in production falling well below that of population. Output of cassava is growing at well over 3% p.a., almost three times the rate of population growth. Cultivated mainly in the tropical belt and in some of the world’s poorest regions, cassava production has doubled over two decades. Once considered a subsistence crop, it is now seen as a commodity and key for value-addition, rural development and poverty alleviation, food security, energy security; and for bringing important macroeconomic benefits. These factors are driving rapid commercialisation of this crop and large-scale investments in upscaling the processing of cassava, both which have contributed significantly to its global expansion. 11.1.2. Current market situation The largest producing regions of roots and tubers in the base period are Asia (102 Mt) and Africa (100 Mt). In Sub Saharan Africa, roots play a significant role as a staple crop. Globally, about 130 Mt are used as food, 57 Mt as feed, and 33 Mt for other uses, mostly biofuel and starch. As the perishable nature of these crops prohibits significant international trade in fresh produce, countries tend to be self-sufficient. About 15 Mt are currently traded internationally, mostly in processed or dried form. Thailand and Viet Nam are the leading exporters and the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”) is the main destination. Global production of roots and tubers reached 251 Mt (dry matter) in the base period (2020-22); about 5 Mt has been added annually in the past years and consumed mainly as food. The prices of roots and tubers (measured by the Cassava (flour) wholesale price in Bangkok) increased again significantly in 2022 as demand was strong, in particular in China. Global quantities traded increased by 0.5 Mt. 11.1.3. Main drivers for projections Producing cassava requires few inputs and affords farmers greater flexibility in terms of timing the harvest as the crop can be left on the ground well after reaching maturation. Cassava’s tolerance to erratic weather conditions, including drought, makes it an important part of climate change adaptation strategies. Compared to other staples, cassava competes favourably in terms of price and diversity of uses. In the form of High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF), cassava is increasingly targeted by governments in Africa as a strategic food crop which does not exhibit the same levels of price volatility as other imported cereals. Mandatory blending with wheat flour helps reduce the volume of wheat imports, thereby lowering import bills and conserving precious foreign exchange. The drive towards energy security in Asia, combined with mandatory blending requirements with gasoline, has led to the establishment of ethanol distilleries that use cassava as a feedstock. With regard to trade, processed cassava manages to compete successfully in the global arena, e.g. with maize-based starch and cereals for animal feeding applications. 250  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Potatoes are generally confined to food use and are a substantial component of diets in developed regions, particularly in Europe and North America. As overall food intake of potato in these regions is very high and may have reached saturation, the scope for consumption increases to outpace population growth remains limited. Developing regions, however, provide some growth momentum to potato production at the world level. Global sweet potato cultivation has declined in recent years, mostly due to a sharp decline in acreage (which shows no sign of abating) in China, the world’s foremost producer. Food demand largely defines the growth potential of sweet potato and other less prominent roots and tuber crops given the limited commercial viability for diversified usage. Consequently, consumer preferences along with prices play important roles in shaping consumption. 11.1.4. Projection highlights World production and utilisation of roots and tubers is projected to increase by about 18% over the next decade. Production growth in low-income regions could reach 2.6% p.a. while supply in high-income countries should grow at only 0.3% annually. Global land use is projected to increase by 6 Mha to 71 Mha, but there will be some regional shifts. African countries are expected to increase their cultivation area, while reductions are projected for Europe and America. Moreover, many farmers in Thailand shifted from Cassava to rice which had better production incentives. Production growth is mainly attributed to investments in yield improvements in Africa and Asia, as well as an intensification of land use in these regions. Figure 11.1. Global players in roots and tubers markets in 2032 Note: Presented numbers refer to shares in world totals of the respective variable Source: OECD/FAO (2023), ''OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook'', OECD Agriculture statistics (database), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data\u0002en. StatLink 2https://stat.link/w863k0 By 2032, an additional 1.4 kg/capita per year of root crops will enter diets at the global level, driven mostly by consumers in Africa where per capita intake of roots and tubers could surpass 41 kg per year. Biofuel use, albeit from a low basis (3% of use), is expected to grow by 37% over the next ten years driven by the Sub-Saharan Africa- 42% China- 16% Nigeria- 15% India- 6% Thailand- 5% Other- 16% Thailand- 60% Viet Nam- 20% United States- 6% Other- 14% Sub-Saharan Africa- 41% China- 20% Nigeria- 15% India- 6% Indonesia- 4% Other- 14% China- 62% United States- 6% Korea- 3% Other- 29% Production Exports Consumption Imports  251 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 Chinese biofuel industry. Feed and other industrial use will remain significant, albeit with slower growth of about 10% and 15% respectively, over the outlook period. International trade in roots and tubers comprises about 6% of the global market production. Over the medium term, this share is expected to remain constant. Exports from Thailand and Viet Nam are growing and are expected to reach a combined total of 15 Mt, mainly to supply the growing biofuel and starch industries in China. After a moderate decrease expected in 2023 due to high pressure on cassava markets in Thailand and the shortfall of potato production in Ukraine, prices of roots and tubers are projected to follow a similar path to cereal prices in the medium term given the substitutability between roots and tubers and cereals on food and feed markets; namely, an increase in nominal prices but a decline in real terms. 11.2. Pulses 11.2.1. Market overview Pulses are the edible seeds of plants in the legume family. Commonly, eleven types are recognised.1 They provide high level of protein, dietary fibre, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and complex carbohydrates. Apart from the nutritional benefits, pulses help to improve digestion, reduce blood glucose, minimise inflammation, lower blood cholesterol, and prevent chronic health issues such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. However, their consumption levels differ from region to region depending on the dietary patterns, availability and prevailing conditions. Cultivation of pulses has a long tradition in almost all regions of the world. For centuries, legumes have played a fundamental role in the functioning of traditional agricultural systems. Prior to 2000, global production of pulses stagnated due to the widespread disappearance of small farms in developing countries which led to a decline of traditional farming systems that included pulses in their crop rotation. Production was further hampered because of their weak resilience to diseases due to a lack of genetic diversity, limited access to high-yield varieties, and the lack of policy support to pulses growers. The sector began to recover in the early 2000s and has since seen an average annual increase of about 3% globally, led by Asia and Africa. These two regions combined accounted for more than half of the 12 Mt production increase in the past decade. Global per capita consumption of pulses started to decline in the 1960s (Figure 11.2) due to slow growth in yields and resulting increases in price. Income growth and urbanisation shifted preferences away from pulses as human diets became richer in animal proteins, sugar, and fats. Nonetheless, pulses have remained an important source of protein in developing countries, and average global per capita food consumption has increased to about 7 kg/year to date. This growth has been driven mainly by income gains in countries where pulses are an important source of protein; this particularly true of India where vegetarians account for about 30% of the population. Pulses can be processed into different forms such as whole pulses, split pulses, pulse flours, and pulse fractions like protein, starch and fibre. The flour and fractions have diverse applications in industries related to meat and snack food, bakery and beverages, and batter and breading. 11.2.2. Current market conditions India is by far the largest producer of pulses, accounting for about 25% of global production in the past decade. Canada (9%), China (6%) and the European Union (5%) are the next largest producing countries. The Asian market accounts for 52% of all consumption, but only about 43% of production, making it the most significant import destination. About 21% of global production is traded internationally with Canada (35% of global trade) by far the largest exporter and India the largest importer (19% of global trade). Africa 252  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 has further expanded its production and consumption in the past decade and has remained largely self\u0002sufficient. In 2022, the global pulses market reached a volume of 93 Mt, after an average annual growth of 1.7% p.a. during the previous decade; this growth was led by Asia and Africa. World trade volumes were registered at 19.5 Mt, 0.5 Mt higher than in 2021.International prices for pulses, approximated by the Canadian field pea price, have started to fall from their peak value of 2021 to USD 359/Mt in 2022, following the production recovery in Canada. 11.2.3. Main drivers for projections As pulses are associated with various health benefits and represent an important meat substitute due to their high protein content, health and environmentally conscious consumers are increasingly integrating these in their daily diets, which in turn is propelling the growth of the global pulses market. Rapid urbanisation, changing lifestyles, and hectic work schedules are also making healthy snack foods popular amongst the working population, and pulses are increasingly used in the processing of ready-to-eat (RTE) food products. Health and environmental benefits are reasons why governments of pulses-producing countries are providing assistance to farmers, and thus supporting growth of this market. Support to the production of pulses production plays an important role in the Protein Strategy of the European Union and are a major ingredient in products such as meat substitutes. Depending on the future dynamics of demand for such products, this could significantly change the future importance of pulses in the agricultural production mix. 11.2.4. Projection highlights Pulses are expected to regain importance in the diets in many regions of the world. This Outlook foresees the global trend in this area to continue and projects global average annual per capita food use to increase to 8.6 kg by 2032. Per capita food consumption is projected to increase in all regions over the coming decade, with the largest increase expected in Europe (+4% p.a.) (Figure 11.2). Global supply is projected to increase by 29 Mt. Almost half of this increase is expected to come from Asia, particularly India, the world’s largest producer. Sustained yield improvements are projected to raise India’s domestic production by an additional 11 Mt by 2032. India has introduced high-yielding hybrid seeds, supported mechanisation, and implemented a minimum support price aimed at stabilising farmer’s income. In addition, the central government and some state governments have included pulses in their procurement programmes, although not with the same geographical coverage as in the case of wheat and rice. This expected production expansion is driven by the assumption of continued intensification of the pulses production systems due to improved yields and intensified land use. About 60% of production growth can be attributed to land use intensification during the projection period, and the remaining 40% to yield improvements.. Particularly in Africa, a combination of area expansion and yield growth is estimated to add about 0.6 Mt annually to the regional production. This Outlook assumes that growth will be sustained by increased intercropping of pulses with cereals, in particular in Asia and Africa where smallholder farmers represent a large share of producers. The projected yield improvements of pulses will continue to lag cereals and oilseeds because in most countries pulses are not included in the development of high-yielding varieties, improved irrigation systems, and agricultural support policies. World trade of pulses grew from 15 Mt to 19 Mt over the past decade and is projected to reach 23 Mt by 2032. Canada remains the main exporter of pulses, with volumes expected to grow from 6.8 Mt at present to 9.9 Mt by 2032, followed by Russia and Australia with 2 Mt and 1.9 Mt of exports by 2032, respectively.  253 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 International prices in nominal terms are expected to decrease further until 2025 then increase slightly over the coming decade, while real prices will decline.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/q26uom 11.3. Bananas and major tropical fruits Bananas and the four major fresh tropical fruits – mango, pineapple, avocado and papaya – play a vital role in world agricultural production, and especially in securing the nutrition and livelihoods of smallholders in producing countries. In recent decades, rising incomes and changing consumer preferences in both emerging and high-income markets, alongside improvements in transport and supply chain management, have facilitated fast growth in international trade in these commodities. Based on provisional 2022 figures, the global banana and major tropical fruit export industries respectively generate around USD 10 billion and USD 11 billion per year. Although only approximately 16% of global banana production and 7% of global major tropical fruit production are traded in international markets (provisional 2022 figures), in exporting countries, which are mostly low- or middle-income economies, revenue from production and trade can weigh substantially in agricultural GDP. For instance, bananas represented about 50% of agricultural export revenue in Ecuador in 2021, while combined exports of pineapples and bananas accounted for some 40% of agricultural export revenue in Costa Rica. As such, trade in bananas and major tropical fruits has the potential to generate significant export earnings in producing countries. For all these underlying reasons, it is important to assess the potential future market development of these agricultural commodities. 11.3.1. Market Situation: Overview According to preliminary data and information, global trade in bananas and major tropical fruits continued to be negatively affected by several factors on the supply side in 2022, which induced rising producer costs and consequent supply shortages, against relatively stable demand in key import markets. Industry sources reported that the high prices for fertilisers and their reduced availability in 2021 and throughout the first half of 2022 resulted in a reduced application by farmers, hampering the productivity and quality of banana and major tropical fruit cultivation in key producing areas. Adverse weather conditions, including abnormally cold weather related to the La Niña phenomenon as well as the passing of yet another severe 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 1966196819701972197419761978 198019821984198619881990199219941996199820002002200420062008 201020122014201620182020202220242026202820302032 kg/person Latin America and the Caribbean Africa World Asia North America Europe Oceania 254  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 tropical storm through the Caribbean further impacted the quantities available for export. Shortages in refrigerated containers stemming from the prolonged lockdowns implemented in some Asian countries during 2022, alongside high global transportation costs in the first half of the year, posed additional obstacles to export growth. The difficult operating environment in 2022 was further complicated by the depreciation of many currencies against the United States dollar, which affected operations all along the value chain since transactions in the banana and tropical fruits industries, including the purchasing of inputs, are habitually conducted in United States dollars. This exerted additional upward pressure on costs to producers, exporters and importers. Although prices along the respective value chains for bananas and major tropical fruits displayed a tendency to increase in response to firm demand in major import markets in 2022, in most cases this was not sufficient to compensate for the substantially higher costs. While producer costs reportedly ranged some 40-50% above their pre-pandemic levels, prices at export, import, wholesale and retail level rose by only some 10 to 20% on average, leaving concerns about heavily reduced profit margins a key topic for the industry in 2022. 11.3.2. Bananas Market situation Preliminary estimates indicate that global exports of bananas, excluding plantain, experienced a decline of 4% in 2022, marking another year of disruption to the fast-paced growth experienced in pre-pandemic years. Total export quantities were thereby estimated to have fallen from 20.5 Mt in 2021 to approximately 19.6 Mt in 2022. The persistently high costs of fertilisers, which had already led to a reduction in use in 2021, were quoted as the key obstacle affecting producers’ ability to supply bananas in adequate quantities and to the quality standards expected in export markets in all regions. Adverse weather conditions affecting production and yields additionally continued to be of concern during the first nine months of 2022, while high costs for land transport and long-distance shipping impeded exporters’ capacity to supply international markets. Severe concerns about the spread of plant diseases, importantly the devastating spread of the Banana Fusarium Wilt Tropical Race 4 (TR4) disease in the Philippines and its alarming presence in Peru and Colombia, further continued to cause substantial strain on the industry through the additional costs associated with disease prevention and production losses. Moreover, in view of the ongoing pandemic, the persisting necessity to apply elevated sanitary measures and physical distancing to protect workers from COVID-19 continued to cause additional costs to producers and operators along the supply chain, especially during the first half of 2022. Global net import quantities of bananas, meanwhile, declined by an estimated 2.5% in 2022, a reduction of nearly 0.5 Mt from the previous year, to just below 19 Mt. While demand in most import markets reportedly remained constant, growth over the first seven months of the year was hindered by a reduced availability of export supplies as well as continuing bottlenecks in global shipping, which posed obstacles to supplies reaching their destination. These factors particularly affected the level of import quantities received over this period by the European Union, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada, which jointly account for some 60% of global imports. On the other hand, imports by China, the third largest importer of bananas globally, continued to expand at a fast rate over the first seven months of 2022, facilitated by strong domestic demand and ample availability of export supplies from emerging producers in Southeast Asia. Projection highlights As per capita demand for bananas is becoming increasingly saturated in most regions, growth in global production and consumption is expected to be primarily driven by population dynamics. In line with slowing world population growth, the current baseline projections therefore expect world production and  255 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 consumption of bananas to expand at a moderate 1.5% p.a. over the outlook period. Assuming normal weather conditions and no further spread of banana plant diseases, global banana production will reach 141 Mt by 2032. At the same time, in some rapidly emerging economies – principally in India and China – fast income growth is anticipated to stimulate changing health and nutrition perceptions and support demand for bananas beyond population growth. Accordingly, Asia which is already the leading producing region is anticipated to remain so at a quantity share of 50%, with India projected to reach an output of 35 Mt by 2032. Production from the leading exporting region of Latin America and the Caribbean is projected to reach 37 Mt by 2032, encouraged by rising demand from key importing markets, most importantly the European Union and the United States. With inflationary pressures expected to continue in 2023 and potentially beyond, demand for bananas in these markets is likely to be supported by the fruit’s relative affordability. Rising import demand from China, where domestic production is likely to continue to decline, is assumed to be an additional factor driving production growth in Latin America and the Caribbean. The largest exporters from the region – critically Ecuador, Guatemala, Colombia, and Costa Rica – all continue to be well positioned to benefit from this growth, assuming that it can be shielded from the adverse effects of erratic weather events and disease outbreaks. Rising import demand from the European Union and the United Kingdom is further expected to benefit some Caribbean exporters, most notably the Dominican Republic and Belize, as well as exports from Africa, which are projected to expand at 1.8% p.a. over the outlook period – led by Ivory Coast – to reach a total quantity of approximately 0.85 Mt in 2032. Against this background, world exports of bananas are projected to reach some 23.7 Mt by 2032. Figure 11.3. Exports of bananas by the four major LAC exporters Source: FAO data. StatLink 2https://stat.link/qbwl2n 11.3.3. Mango, mangosteen and guava Market situation Preliminary data indicate that global exports of mango, mangosteen and guava declined to approximately 2.1 Mt in 2022, a decrease of 5%, or some 0.12 Mt, from the previous year. The main reasons behind this were a substantial drop in exports of mangosteen from Thailand, as well as lower exports of mangoes from Brazil and Peru, which could not be offset by higher exports from Mexico, the leading exporter of this commodity group. In terms of export quantities by type at the global level, mango accounted for around 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Mt Ecuador Colombia Costa Rica Guatemala 256  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 83% of global shipments and mangosteen for around 16%. As previously, guava continued to display a low availability in import markets, in particular due to its lower suitability for transport. Total global import quantities of fresh mangoes, mangosteens, and guavas fell by an estimated 1% in 2022, to some 2 Mt, as suggested by available monthly trade data up to August 2022. The United States and the European Union remained the two leading global importers, with approximate import shares of 26% and 18%, respectively. In both markets industry sources reported higher consumer demand for mangoes, despite prices and inflationary pressures being high, in line with a generally higher nutritional awareness of the assumed health benefits of these fruits. However, import growth in the United States over the first eight months of the year were somewhat constrained by the difficult supply situation in Peru and Brazil, the second and third leading origins for mangoes in the United States, which seemingly could not be fully offset by higher imports from Mexico. Overall, imports into the United States thereby remained largely at their previous year’s level of approximately 0.56 Mt in 2022. Imports into the European Union, meanwhile, declined by an estimated 5% in 2022, to some 0.39 Mt, similarly on the back of supply shortages in Brazil and Peru, the two primary origins of mangoes imported to the European Union. Projection highlights Global production of mangoes, mangosteens and guavas is projected to increase at 3.3% p.a. over the next decade, to reach 84 Mt by 2032. As with most other tropical fruits, growth in mango production will mainly respond to income-driven demand growth in producing countries, additionally supported by population dynamics. Asia, the native region of mangoes and mangosteens, will continue to account for some 70% of global production in 2032. This will be primarily due to strong growth in domestic demand in India, the leading producer and consumer of mangoes globally, where rising incomes and associated shifts in dietary preferences will be the main drivers of production expansion. Mango production in India is accordingly projected to account for nearly 38 Mt in 2032, or 45% of global production, destined largely for local informal markets. As such, India is projected to experience increases in per capita consumption of 2.4% p.a. over the outlook period, reaching 24.8 kg in 2032, compared to 18.3 kg in the base period. By contrast, in Mexico and Thailand, the leading exporters of this commodity cluster to world markets, production growth will primarily be driven by expanding global import demand. Exports are accordingly anticipated to reach a 31% share of production in Mexico by 2032, and 26% in Thailand. However, at projected production quantities of 3.2 and 1.8 Mt in 2032, respectively, Mexico and Thailand will account only for comparatively small shares in global production. Global exports of mangoes, mangosteens and guavas are projected to reach 2.8 Mt in 2032, compared to 2.2 Mt in the base period, on account of higher procurements from the United States, China, and the European Union. Mexico, the leading supplier of mangoes, is expected to benefit from further growth in import demand from its major market, the United States, and reach a 35% share of world exports in 2032. Shipments from Thailand, almost exclusively mangosteens, will cater mainly to rising import demand from China, while supplies from Peru and Brazil, two emerging exporters, will be mostly mangoes destined for the European Union. Both Thailand and Peru are projected to reach a share in global exports of 15% each by 2032, followed by Brazil at some 11%. China, whose per capita mango, mangosteen and guava consumption of 2.6 kg in the base period is relatively low compared to other Asian countries, is expected to experience a rise in imports of 3% p.a., to some 0.36 Mt in 2032. This will be mainly due to a strong income-driven increase in Chinese import demand for mangosteen, as domestic production of this fruit remains low in China.  257 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 11.3.4. Pineapple Market situation Based on preliminary trade data, global exports of pineapples fell by an estimated 1.5% in 2022, to just below 3.2 Mt, determined largely by reduced supplies from Costa Rica, the world’s largest exporter at a market share of almost 70%. According to industry information, cold weather conditions, high energy costs and container problems negatively affected production and export supplies from Costa Rica in 2022. Shipments from the country were accordingly expected to fall by some 2% in 2022, equivalent to a drop of some 0.05 Mt, to just below 2.2 Mt, in strong contrast with the 11% expansion experienced in 2021. In terms of leading destinations, pineapple shipments from Costa Rica continued to be almost exclusively destined to the United States and the European Union. Preliminary trade data point to a decline of global imports of pineapples to 2.9 Mt in 2022, a fall of an estimated 1% compared to 2021, on account of supply shortages from the main global supplier, Costa Rica. As demand in the United States and the European Union continued to be solid over the first nine months of the year, indicative average import unit values in both key destinations displayed a tendency to increase. Aided by a strong dollar and an upswing of sales in the hospitality sector, imports by the United States increased by an estimated 4% in 2022, to 1.1 Mt. Conversely, imports by the European Union, the second largest importer, fell by an estimated 8% as supply shortages and shipping issues reduced the quantities that could be received throughout at least the first nine months of the year. Weaker economic conditions and a lower value of the euro against the US dollar posed further difficulties. Over the full year, imports by the European Union were anticipated to drop to approximately 0.76 Mt, some 17% below their previous five-year average. Estimates thereby suggest that the United States procured about 39% of global export supplies over the full year 2022, and the European Union some 26%. Projection highlights Over the next decade, global production of pineapple is projected to grow at 2% p.a., to reach 32 Mt in 2032, on account of a 1.7% expansion in harvested area. Asia is expected to remain the largest producing region and account for some 44% of quantities produced globally, with pineapple production being sizeable in the Philippines, Thailand, India, Indonesia and China. Cultivation in Asia will continue to largely cater to domestic demand and is projected to grow solidly in response to changing demographics and income growth, especially in India, Indonesia and China. Similarly, pineapple production in Latin America and the Caribbean, the second largest producing region at a projected 34% of world production in 2032, will be primarily driven by the evolving consumption needs of the region’s growing and increasingly affluent population. Only Costa Rica and the Philippines, two important global producers and leading exporters to world markets, are anticipated to see additional stimulation from rising import demand, with exports expected to account for approximately 68% of fresh pineapple production in Costa Rica and 18% in the Philippines in 2032. Global exports of fresh pineapple are set to grow at 1.3% p.a., to 3.5 Mt in 2032, predominantly driven by import demand from the United States and the European Union. With projected imports of 1.1 Mt in 2032 – equivalent to a 34% global share – the United States are expected to remain the largest importer, ahead of the European Union, which is expected to account for some 26% of global imports. In both key import markets, demand for fresh pineapples is assumed to benefit from the fruit’s continuously low unit prices and to some degree also from the introduction of more premium novelty varieties. Rising import demand from China, where consumption growth has been outpacing production expansion in recent years, is expected to additionally drive expansion in global exports. By 2032, China is projected to reach import quantities of some 0.39 Mt per year, with supplies likely to be primarily sourced in the Philippines. 258  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 11.3.5. Avocado Market situation Global exports of avocado declined by an estimated 6% in 2022, to below 2.4 Mt, on account of severe weather-induced supply shortages in Mexico, the world’s leading exporter. Although preliminary data and information indicate that exports from most alternative origins continued to grow at comparatively fast rates, these increases seemingly did not fully offset the unprecedented shortfall in supplies from Mexico. Available monthly data for exports from Mexico for the period January to August 2022 indicate a year-on\u0002year fall in shipments of 32%, pointing to a full-year estimate of 1 Mt, some 0.38 Mt below the previous year’s level. Global imports of avocados similarly fell by an estimated 6% in 2022, to approximately 2.3 Mt. Despite continuously strong demand in the two major import markets, the United States and the European Union, which were estimated to respectively account for 45% and 25% of global imports in 2022, overall growth in global imports was curtailed by the supply shortages experienced in Mexico. As such, imports by the United States declined by an estimated 11% in 2022, to approximately 1 Mt. The United States are particularly susceptible to changes in the supply situation in Mexico since they typically import some 90% of avocados from this origin. Meanwhile, imports into the European Union seemingly remained relatively stable at some 0.58 Mt, displaying only a very slight tendency to contract. Like the situation in the United States, consumption across the European Union continued to gain in popularity among an increasingly health-conscious population, with avocados widely perceived as a highly nutritious fruit. Projection highlights Avocado has the lowest production level among the major tropical fruits but has experienced the fastest expansion in output in recent decades and is expected to remain the most rapidly growing commodity of the major tropical fruits over the outlook period. Ample global demand, high returns per hectare and lucrative export unit prices continue to be the main drivers of this growth, stimulating investments in area expansion in both major and emerging production zones. By 2032, production is thereby projected to reach 12 Mt p.a. – more than three times its level in 2010. While new growing areas have been emerging rapidly in recent years, avocado production is likely to remain largely concentrated in a small number of regions and countries. The top four producing countries – Mexico, Colombia, Peru and the Dominican Republic – are projected to expand their production substantially over the coming decade, together accounting for over 50% of global production in 2032, with output in Colombia and Peru set to increase by some 60-70% from base period levels. As such, about 66% of avocado production is expected to remain in Latin America and the Caribbean, given the favourable growing conditions in this region. In response to rapidly growing global demand, and facilitated by fast output expansion, avocado is on track to become the most traded major tropical fruit by 2032, reaching 3.8 Mt of exports and overtaking both pineapples and mangoes in quantity terms. Given the high average unit prices of avocado, the total value of global avocado exports would thus reach an estimated USD 8.7 billion in constant 2014-16 value terms, thereby placing avocado as one of the most valuable fruit commodities. Despite increasing competition from emerging exporters, Mexico is expected to retain its leading position in global exports at a 40% share in 2032. This will be supported by output growth of 3.6% p.a. over the coming decade and continued growth in demand in the United States, the key importer of avocados from Mexico. Exports from Peru, the second leading exporter, will reach some 24% of global shipments, with supplies mainly catering to rising demand from the European Union. The United States and the European Union, where consumer interest in avocados is fuelled by the fruit’s claimed health benefits, are expected to remain the main importers, with 44% and 27% of global imports in 2032, respectively. However, imports are also set to rise rapidly in many other countries such as in China and some countries in the Middle East, on account of rising incomes and changing consumer preferences  259 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 in these markets. Similarly, in many producing countries, per capita consumption of avocados is expected to rise with income growth, notably in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Indonesia. It is important to note, however, that in both domestic and import markets, demand for avocados may be susceptible to changes in the macroeconomic outlook. Given the typically high unit values of avocados, as well as their relatively high income and price elasticities of demand, changes in consumer incomes – or prices – may quickly affect demand. That said, import demand for avocados has exhibited relative resilience to changes in income in both major import markets, the United States and the European Union, where demand also appears determined by changes in consumer preferences, as demonstrated by the fruit’s uninterrupted robust growth over the past decade. 11.3.6. Papaya Market situation Preliminary trade data indicate a rise in global exports of papayas by an estimated 1% in 2022, to some 0.37 Mt. Exports from Mexico, the largest global exporter of papayas, seemingly grew by some 4% over the full year, on account of further production expansion. Virtually all Mexican papaya exports are destined for the United States, which globally ranks as the largest importer of papayas, accounting for over half of global imports in 2022. The bulk of Mexican papaya production, however, is destined for domestic consumption, meaning that trade outcomes depend critically on developments in both domestic and foreign markets. Global imports, meanwhile, remained largely stable at some 0.34 Mt in 2022, albeit displaying a slight tendency to contract by an estimated 0.3%. Available data indicate that imports by the United States grew by an approximate 1% in 2022, to some 0.19 Mt, facilitated by the ample supply situation in Mexico, the leading supplier of papayas to the United States. Although the estimated pace of growth was noticeably slower than in 2021, when imports by the United States grew by 5% year-on-year, industry sources stated that demand for papayas in the United States remained solid over the first nine months of 2022. The second leading importer globally continued to be the European Union, albeit with a much lower share in world imports of only 10%. Consumer awareness of papaya in the European Union remains low, mostly due to the fruit’s fragility in transport, which renders a significant expansion in this market difficult to attain. Projection highlights Global papaya production is projected to rise by 1.9% p.a., to 18 Mt in 2032. As the share of exports in production is particularly low for papayas, at some 2.5% in the base period, production of this fruit is mostly driven by domestic demand due to population and income growth. Against this background, the strongest production expansion is expected to be experienced in Asia, the leading producing region globally, where both drivers are expected to have significant impact. Accordingly, Asia’s share of world production is set to rise to 60% by 2032, from 58% in the base period. The world’s largest producer, India, is projected to increase its papaya production at a rate of 1.6% p.a., thereby expanding its share of global output to 37% by 2032. Income and population growth will be the main factors behind this rise, with Indian per capita consumption of papayas expected to reach 4.4 kg in 2032, up from 4.1 kg in the base period. In Indonesia, meanwhile, production is projected to grow by 2.8% p.a. over the outlook period, primarily on account of increasing domestic demand as per-capita incomes are expected to expand at over 4% p.a. Global exports will predominantly be shaped by production expansion in Mexico, the largest global exporter of papayas, and higher demand from the key importers, the United States and the European Union. At an expected average annual rate of 1.9%, global exports of papayas are projected to reach just over 0.46 Mt by 2032. However, a major obstacle to a significant expansion in international trade remains the fruit’s high perishability and sensitivity in transport, which makes produce problematic to supply to far afield destinations. Innovations in cold chain, packaging and transport technologies promise to facilitate a 260  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 broader distribution of papaya, particularly in view of rising consumer demand for tropical fruits in import markets. Figure 11.4. Global exports of the four major tropical fruits Source: FAO data. StatLink 2https://stat.link/on2ldj 11.3.7. Uncertainties With regard to the outlook, several significant threats to global production, trade and consumption of bananas and major fresh tropical fruits are present. On the demand side, prevailing high inflation rates, high interest expenses and exchange rate fluctuations threaten to hinder the demand for bananas and tropical fruits, especially for consumers in poorer economic strata who need to spend a higher proportion of their income on food. Some analysts have also been predicting a global recession, and while recently released forecasts now seem to rule out this scenario, at least for 2023, should it nevertheless materialize, this may further restrain demand growth. The uncertainties surrounding Russia’s war against Ukraine with regard to its impact on global supply chains, fertiliser markets, transport routes and access to export markets add further risks for the outlook. On the supply side, the effects of global warming are resulting in a higher occurrence of droughts, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters, which render the production of bananas and major tropical fruits increasingly difficult and costly. Given the perishable nature of tropical fruits in production, trade and distribution, environmental challenges and insufficient infrastructure continue to jeopardise production and supply to international markets. This is a particularly acute difficulty since the vast majority of tropical fruits are produced in remote, informal settings, where cultivation is highly dependent on rainfall, prone to the adverse effects of increasingly erratic weather events and disconnected from major transport routes. In the face of rising temperatures, more rapid and more severe spreads of plant pests and diseases are additionally being observed, as for example is the case with the fungus Banana Fusarium Wilt. The currently expanding strain of the disease, described as Tropical Race 4 (TR4), poses particularly high risks to global banana supplies as it can affect a much broader range of banana and plantain cultivars than other strains of Fusarium wilt. Furthermore, despite some recent breakthroughs in the engineering of resistant varieties, no effective fungicide or other eradication method is currently available. According to official information, TR4 is currently confirmed in 21 countries, predominantly in South and Southeast Asia, but also in the Middle East, Africa, Oceania and Latin America, with Colombia reporting the first infection in August 2019, Peru in April 2021, and Venezuela in January 2023. An indicative assessment of the potential economic impact of the TR4 disease on global banana production and trade showed that a further spread 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 Mt Avocado Pineapples Papaya Mango  261 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023-2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 of TR4 would, inter alia, entail considerable loss of income and employment in the banana sector in the affected countries, as well as significantly higher consumer costs in importing countries, at varying degrees contingent on the actual spread of the disease. Given the popularity particularly of bananas, pineapples and avocados in import markets, their global value chains have been characterised by intense competition among market actors all the way to the retail level. For bananas and pineapples, this has exerted downward pressure on prices at each stage, which has resulted in producer prices remaining at low levels, with little fluctuation. Combined with rising production costs, low prices and tight profit margins greatly hinder the adequate remuneration of workers and smallholder farmers in these industries and act as a major obstacle for producers in coping with emerging challenges and supply chain disruptions. The prospects for production are therefore further threatened by an elevated risk of industry contraction, with producers discouraged to continue their operations by low or even negative producer margins, reducing supplies to world markets and consequently causing higher food prices. Data on developments in world export and import markets over the course of 2022 already point to this direction, with all key regions being affected.

Glossary Aquaculture The farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans, aquatic plants, etc. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding and protection from predators. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms that are harvested by an individual or corporate body that has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms that are exploitable by the public as a common property resource, with or without appropriate licenses, are the harvest of capture fisheries. In this Outlook, data relating to aquatic plants are not included. African Swine Fever (ASF) ASF is a highly contagious hemorrhagic disease of pigs, warthogs, European wild boar and American wild pigs. It is not a human health threat. The organism that causes ASF is a DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family. (For more information on this topic: https://www.woah.org/en/disease/african-swine-fever/) Avian Influenza (AI) AI is a highly contagious viral infection which can affect all species of birds and can manifest itself in different ways depending mainly on the ability of the virus to cause disease (pathogenicity) on the species affected (for more information on this topic, see https://www.woah.org/en/disease/avian-influenza/) Baseline The set of market projections used for the Outlook analysis, also used as benchmark to analyse the impact of different economic and policy scenarios. A detailed description on how this baseline was generated is provided in the methodology section Biofuels In the wider sense, biofuels can be defined as all solid, fluid or gaseous fuels produced from biomass. More narrowly, the term comprises fuels that replace petroleum-based road-transport fuels. Ethanol is produced from sugar crops, cereals and other starchy crops, and can be used as an additive to, in a blend with, or as a replacement of gasoline. Biodiesel is produced mostly from vegetable oils, but also from waste oils and animal fats. There are two major forms of biodiesel: fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO). Biomass Biomass is defined as any plant matter used directly as fuel or converted into other forms before combustion. Included are wood, vegetal waste (including wood waste and crops used for energy production), animal materials/wastes and industrial and urban wastes, used as feedstock for producing bio-based products. In the context of the Outlook, it does not include agricultural commodities used in the production of biofuels (e.g. vegetable oils, sugar or grains). Blend wall The term blend wall refers to short run technical constraints that act as an impediment to increased biofuel use in transportation fuels. BRICS Refers to the emerging economies of Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, the People’s Republic of China, and South Africa. Bt cotton A transgenic cotton variety that contains one or more foreign genes derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Bt cotton is resistant against some insect pests, but the fibre of BT cotton plants is shorter than that of traditional varieties. Caloric sweeteners Defined as sucrose and high fructose syrup. Capture fisheries Capture fisheries refer to the hunting, collecting and gathering activities directed at removing or collecting live wild aquatic organisms (predominantly fish, molluscs and crustaceans) including plants from the oceanic, coastal or inland waters for human consumption and other purposes by hand or more usually by various types of fishing gear such as nets, lines and stationary traps. The production of capture fisheries is measured by nominal catches (in live weight basis) of fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic animals and plants, killed, caught, trapped or collected for all commercial, industrial, recreational and subsistence purposes. It should be noted that in this Outlook data relating to aquatic plants are not included. Cereals Defined as wheat, maize, other coarse grains and rice (milled). Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) The European Union’s agricultural policy, first defined in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome  263 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 signed in 1957 Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) CPTPP is a trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Viet Nam. It was signed in March 2018 and came into force for the first six countries in December 2018. Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) CETA is a trade agreement between the European Union and Canada. CETA was signed in October 2016 and is in provisional application as of April 2017. Full ratification and implementation is still pending COVID-19 COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally. Decoupled payments Direct payments which are not linked to current production of specific commodities or livestock numbers or the use of specific factors of production. Developed and developing countries See summary table for country grouping in the Agricultural Outlook. Direct payments Payments made directly by governments to producers Domestic support Refers to the annual level of support, expressed in monetary terms, provided to agricultural production. It is one of the three pillars of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture targeted for reduction. El Niño- Southern Oscillation El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) refers to periodic but irregular variations in wind and sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. ENSO consists of a warming phase known as El Niño and a cooling phase known as La Niña, and occurs typically at intervals of two to seven years. The abnormal warm ocean climate conditions of El Niño are accompanied by higher local rainfall and flooding, and massive deaths of fish and their predators (including birds). Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) 2007 US legislation passed in December 2007 that is designed to increase US energy security by lessening dependence on imported oil, to improve energy conservation and efficiency, expand the production of renewable fuels, and to make America’s air cleaner for future generations. Ethanol A biofuel that can be used as a fuel substitute (hydrous ethanol) or a fuel extender (anhydrous ethanol) in mixes with petroleum, and which is produced from agricultural feedstocks such as sugar cane and maize. Anhydrous alcohol is free of water and at least 99% pure. Hydrous alcohol contains water and usually has a purity of 96%. In Brazil, this ethanol is being used as a gasohol substitute in flex-fuel vehicles. Everything-But-Arms (EBA) The EBA Initiative eliminates EU import tariffs for numerous goods, including agricultural products, from the least developed countries as of 2009-10. Export subsidies Subsidies given to traders to cover the difference between internal market prices and world market prices, such as the EU export restitutions. The elimination of agricultural export subsidies is part of the Nairobi Package adopted at the WTO’s Tenth Ministerial Conference in December 2015. Farm Bill In the United States, the Farm Bill is the primary agricultural and food policy tool of the federal government. Fertiliser Fertilisers provide essential nutrients for maintaining agricultural crop yields and quality, and for growth in production. The three most important nutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) Vehicles that can run on either gasohol or on hydrous ethanol. Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) FMD is the most contagious disease of mammals and has a great potential for causing severe economic loss in susceptible cloven-hoofed animals (https://www.woah.org/en/disease/foot-and-mouth-disease/). International animal trade is linked to the FMD-status according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). Fresh dairy products Fresh Dairy Products contain all dairy products and milk which are not included in the processed products (butter, cheese skim milk powder, whole milk powder and for some cases casein and whey). The quantities are in cow milk equivalent. G20 The G20 is an international forum made up of 19 countries and the European Union, representing the world’s major developed and emerging economies. Together, the G20 members represent 85% of global GDP, 75% of international trade, and two-thirds of the world’s population. Originally bringing together finance ministers and central bank governors, the G20 has evolved into a forum to address broader global challenges. Gasohol Fuel that is a mixture of gasoline and anhydrous ethanol. High Fructose Sweetener (HFS) Starch-based sweetener extracted mainly from maize (high fructose corn syrup or HFCS). Intervention stocks Stocks held by national intervention agencies in the European Union as a result of intervention buying of commodities subject to market price support. Intervention stocks 264  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 may be released onto the internal market if internal prices exceed intervention prices. Isoglucose Isoglucose is a starch-based fructose sweetener, produced by the action of the glucose isomerase enzyme on dextrose. This isomerisation process can be used to produce glucose/fructose blends containing up to 42% fructose. Application of a further process can raise the fructose content to 55%. Where the fructose content is 42%, isoglucose is equivalent in sweetness to sugar. Least squares growth rate The least-squares growth rate, r, is estimated by fitting a linear regression trend line to the logarithmic annual values of the variable in the relevant period, as follows: Ln(xt) = a + r * t and is calculated as [exp (r) – 1]. Live weight The weight of meat, finfish and shellfish at the time of their capture or harvest. In the case of fish products it is calculated on the basis of conversion factors from landed to nominal weight and on rates prevailing among national industries for each type of processing. Market access Governed by provisions of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture which refer to concessions contained in the country schedules with respect to bindings and reductions of tariffs and to other minimum import commitments. Marketing year It is common to compare crop production across “marketing years,” which are defined so that one season’s harvest is not artificially split up across different calendar years. In this Outlook, international marketing years are mostly defined starting with their harvest in major supply regions, as follows: • Wheat: 1 June; 1 October in Australia • Cotton: 1 August • Maize: 1 September; 1 March in Australia • Other coarse grains : 1 September; 1 November in Australia • Sugar, soybeans, other oilseeds, protein meal, vegetable oils: 1 October; 1 November in Australia. Whenever the text refers to, for example, the marketing year 2021, this is short for 2021/22 for the above commodities. For all other commodities, the marketing year is equal to the calendar year except for meat and dairy products in New Zealand and beef and dairy products in Australia: year ending June 30. North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) A trilateral agreement on trade, including agricultural trade, between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, phasing out tariffs and revising other trade rules between the three countries over a 15-year period. The agreement was signed in December 1992 and came into effect on 1 January 1994. In 2018, a new agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada (USMCA) was signed. This agreement entered into force on 1 July 2020. Other coarse grains Defined as barley, oats, sorghum and other coarse grains in all countries except Australia where it includes triticale, and in the European Union where it includes rye and other mixed grains. Other oilseeds Defined as rapeseed (canola), sunflower seed, and groundnuts (peanuts). Producer Support Estimate (PSE) Indicator developed and compiled by the OECD showing the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers, measured at farm gate level, and arising from policy measures (regardless of their nature, objectives or impacts on farm production or income). The PSE measures support arising from policies targeted to agriculture relative to a situation without such policies, i.e. when producers are subject only to general policies (including economic, social, environmental and tax policies) of the country. The percentage PSE is the ratio of the PSE to the value of total gross farm receipts, measured by the value of total production (at farm gate prices) plus budgetary support (see http://www.oecd.org/agriculture/topics/agricultural-policy\u0002monitoring-and-evaluation/). Protein meals Defined as soybean meal, groundnut meal, rapeseed meal, sunflower meal, coconut meal, cottonseed meal and palm kernel meal.

The PPPs are given in national currency units per US dollar. Renewable Energy Directive (RED) EU directive legislating binding mandates of 20% for the share of renewable energy in all Member States’ energy mix by the year 2020, with a specific target of 10% for the renewable energy share in transport fuels. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS and RFS2) A standard in the United States for renewable fuel use in the transport sector in the Energy Act (EISA). RFS2 is a revision of the RFS program for 2010 and beyond. Roots and Tubers Plants that yield starch, either derived from their roots (e.g. cassava, sweet potato and yams) or stems (e.g. potatoes and taro). They are destined mainly for human food (as such or in processed form) but can also be used for animal feed or for manufacturing  265 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 starch, ethanol and fermented beverages. Unless they are processed, they become highly perishable once harvested, which limits opportunities for trade and storage. Roots and tubers contain large amounts of water: all quantities in this publication refer to dry weight to increase comparability. Scenario A model-generated set of market projections based on alternative assumptions than those used in the baseline. Used to provide quantitative information on the impact of changes in assumptions on the outlook. Stock-to-use ratio The stock-to-use ratio for cereals is defined as the ratio of cereal stocks to its domestic utilisation. Stock-to-disappearance ratio The stock-to-disappearance ratio is defined as the ratio of stocks held by the main exporters to their disappearance (i.e. domestic utilisation plus exports). For wheat, the eight major exporters are considered, namely the United States, Argentina, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. In the case of coarse grains, United States, Argentina, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Brazil are considered. For rice Viet Nam, Thailand, India, Pakistan and the United States enter this ratio calculation. Sugar Sucrose produced from sugar beet and sugarcane Support price Prices fixed by government policy makers in order to determine, directly or indirectly, domestic market or producer prices. All administered price schemes set a minimum guaranteed support price or a target price for the commodity, which is maintained by associated policy measures, such as quantitative restrictions on production and imports; taxes, levies and tariffs on imports; export subsidies; and/or public stockholding Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ) A two-tier tariff regime where imports within the quota enter at a lower (“in-quota”) tariff rate while a higher (“out-of-quota”) tariff rate is used for imports above this level, As part of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, certain countries agreed to provide minimum import opportunities for products they had previously protected by tariffs. Tel quel basis Weight of sugar, regardless of its sucrose content (measured by polarisation). Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) An international agreement negotiated as part of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Methodology This annex provides information on how the projections in the Agricultural Outlook are generated. First, it provides a general description of the different elements and timeline of the process leading to the agricultural baseline projections and the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook publication each year. Second, it discusses the consistent assumptions made on the projections of exogenous macroeconomic variables. Third, it provides reference to the underlying Aglink-Cosimo model. Finally, it explains how a partial stochastic analysis is performed with the Aglink-Cosimo model. The generating process of the agricultural baseline projections The projections presented in the Agricultural Outlook are the result of a process that brings together information from a large number of sources. The projections rely on input from country and commodity experts, and from the OECD-FAO Aglink-Cosimo model of global agricultural markets. This economic model is also used to ensure the consistency of baseline projections. Significant expert judgement, however, is applied at various stages of the Outlook process. The OECD and FAO Secretariats publish in the Agricultural Outlook a unified and plausible assessment of the future developments of the main agricultural commodity markets given the underlying assumptions and the information available at the time of writing. The starting point: Creation of an initial baseline The historical data series for the consumption, production, trade1 and international prices of the various commodities covered in the Outlook are mainly drawn from OECD and FAO databases. These databases are largely based on national statistical sources. For each publication, the baseline generating process begins in November of the year preceding the projected decade and ends in April of the following year. Starting values for the likely future development of agricultural markets are developed separately by OECD for its member states and some non-member countries and by FAO for all remaining countries. • On the OECD side, an annual questionnaire addressed to national administrations is circulated in November to obtain countries’ expectations of the medium term developments of their agricultural sector , as well as insights on the current status or recent changes of domestic agricultural policies. • On the FAO side, the starting values for the country and regional modules are developed through model-based projections and consultations with FAO commodity specialists. Macroeconomic factors obtained from external sources, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the United Nations (UN), are also used to complete the view of the main economic forces determining market developments. This part of the process is aimed at creating a first insight into possible market developments and at establishing the key assumptions which condition the Outlook. The main macroeconomic and policy assumptions are summarised in the first section of the Trends and Prospects chapter and in specific commodity tables. The sources for the assumptions are discussed in more detail further below.  267 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 As a next step, the OECD-FAO Aglink-Cosimo modelling framework is used to facilitate a consistent integration of the initial data and to derive an initial baseline of global market projections. The modelling framework ensures that at a global level, projected levels of consumption match with projected levels of production for the different commodities. The model is discussed below. In addition to quantities produced, consumed and traded, the baseline also includes projections for nominal prices (in local currency units) for the commodities concerned. The initial baseline results are then reviewed: • For the countries under the responsibility of the OECD Secretariat, the initial baseline results are compared with the questionnaire replies. Any issues are discussed in bilateral exchanges with country experts. • For country and regional modules developed by the FAO Secretariat, initial baseline results are reviewed by a wider circle of in-house and international experts. Final baseline At this stage, the global projection picture starts to emerge, and refinements are made according to a consensus view of both Secretariats and external experts. On the basis of these discussions and updated information, a second baseline is produced. The information generated is used to prepare market assessments for cereals, oilseeds, sugar, meats, dairy products, fish, biofuels and cotton over the course of the Outlook period. These results are then discussed at the annual meetings of the Group on Commodity Markets of the OECD Committee for Agriculture in March, which brings together experts from national administrations of OECD countries as well as experts from commodity organisations. Following comments by this group, and data revisions, the baseline projections are finalised. The Outlook process implies that the baseline projections presented in this report are a combination of projections and experts knowledge. The use of a formal modelling framework reconciles inconsistencies between individual country projections and forms a global equilibrium for all commodity markets. The review process ensures that judgement of country experts is brought to bear on the projections and related analyses. However, the final responsibility for the projections and their interpretation rests with the OECD and FAO Secretariats. The Agricultural Outlook delves into the finale baseline projections to provide an overview as well as more detailed analyses of the world agricultural markets over the medium term. The report is discussed by the Senior Management Committee of FAO’s Department of Economic and Social Development and the OECD’s Working Party on Agricultural Policies and Markets of the Committee for Agriculture in May, prior to publication. In addition, the Outlook will be used as a basis for analyses presented to the FAO’s Committee on Commodity Problems and its various Intergovernmental Commodity Groups. Sources and assumptions for the macroeconomic projections The Outlook uses the Medium Variant set of estimates from the United Nations Population Prospects database for the population data used for all countries and regional aggregates. For the projection period, the medium variant set of estimates was selected for use from the four alternative projection variants (low, medium, high and constant fertility). The UN Population Prospects database was chosen because it represents a comprehensive source of reliable estimates which includes data for non-OECD developing countries. For consistency reasons, the same source is used for both the historical population estimates and the projection data. 268  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The other macroeconomic series used in the Aglink-Cosimo model are real GDP, the GDP deflator, the private consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator, the Brent crude oil price (in US dollars per barrel) and exchange rates expressed as the local currency value of USD 1. Historical data for these series in OECD countries as well as Brazil, Argentina, the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation are consistent with those published in the OECD Economic Outlook No. 112 (December 2022). For other economies, historical macroeconomic data were obtained from the IMF, World Economic Outlook (October 2022). Assumptions for 2023 to 2032 are based on the projections of the IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2022. The model uses indices for real GDP, consumer prices (PCE deflator) and producer prices (GDP deflator) which are constructed with the base year 2010 value being equal to 1. The assumption of constant real exchange rates implies that a country with higher (lower) inflation relative to the United States (as measured by the US GDP deflator) will have a depreciating (appreciating) currency and therefore an increasing (decreasing) exchange rate over the projection period, since the exchange rate is measured as the local currency value of USD 1. The calculation of the nominal exchange rate uses the percentage growth of the ratio “country-GDP deflator/US GDP deflator”. The oil price used to generate the Outlook until 2021 is taken from the short-term update of the OECD Economic Outlook No. 112 (December 2022). For 2022, the annual average daily spot price is used, while the December average daily spot price is used for 2023. For the remainder of the projection period, the reference oil price used in the projections is assumed to remain constant in real terms. . The underlying Aglink-Cosimo model Aglink-Cosimo is an economic model that analyses supply and demand of world agriculture. It is managed by the Secretariats of the OECD and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and used to generate consistent baseline projections presented in the Agricultural Outlook and policy scenario analysis. Aglink-Cosimo is a recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium model used to simulate developments of annual market balances and prices for the main agricultural commodities produced, consumed and traded worldwide. The Aglink-Cosimo country and regional modules cover the whole world. The OECD and FAO Secretariats in conjunction with country experts and national administrations are responsible for developing and maintaining the projections. Several key characteristics are as follows: • Aglink-Cosimo is a “partial equilibrium” model for the main agricultural commodities, as well as biodiesel and bioethanol. Other non-agricultural markets are not modelled and are treated exogenously to the model. As non-agricultural markets are exogenous, hypotheses concerning the paths of key macroeconomic variables are predetermined with no accounting of feedback from developments in agricultural markets to the economy as a whole. • World markets for agricultural commodities are assumed to be competitive, with buyers and sellers acting as price takers. Market prices are determined through a global or regional equilibrium in supply and demand. • Domestically produced and traded commodities are viewed to be homogeneous and thus perfect substitutes by buyers and sellers. In particular, importers do not distinguish commodities by country of origin as Aglink-Cosimo is not a spatial model. Imports and exports are nevertheless determined separately. This assumption affects the results of analysis in which trade is a major driver. • Aglink-Cosimo is recursive-dynamic, and outcomes for one year influence those for the next years (e.g. through herd sizes or dynamic yield expectations). Aglink-Cosimo models ten years into the future.  269 OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 The modelling framework is regularly improved to develop the Outlook’s capacity to reflect future markets developments and to provide an enhanced analysis of beyond market outcomes (e.g. food security, land use and environmental outcomes). As of the 2022-2023 Outlook cycle, the Secretariats have explicitly incorporated the use of the three main mineral fertilisers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium) into the yield equations that determine the supply of crop commodities. This new feature separates the costs of fertilisers from those of other production inputs (energy, seeds, machinery, labour and other tradable and non-tradable inputs). Historical data series for fertiliser use per crop has been developed by combining existing information on total use from FAOSTAT with per crop estimates from the International Fertilizer Association. Food loss and waste has been incorporated in the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2023-2032. Box 1.1 provides a more detailed overview of the definitions, global estimates and drivers. In terms of implementation in the data and Aglink-Cosimo, two shares have been added: one for distribution losses and one for waste. Consequently, three different values for food use of agricultural commodities are available. Firstly, food availability which was the value used in previous Agricultural Outlooks. Secondly, after subtracting losses food consumption is obtained. Currently, this is the main reference value used throughout the report and tables. Thirdly, food intake is the quantity after accounting for waste. The current values of loss and waste are preliminary, and this integration is still in progress. The latest detailed documentation of Aglink-Cosimo model is available on the official website of the Agricultural Outlook www.agri-outlook.org. The model used to generate the fish projections is operated as a satellite model to Aglink-Cosimo. Exogenous assumptions are shared and interacting variables (e.g. prices for cross-price reactions) are exchanged. The fish model went through substantial revision in 2016. The aggregated aquaculture supply functions of 32 components of the model were replaced by 117 species-specific supply functions with specific elasticity, feed ration and time lag. The main species covered are salmon and trout, shrimp, tilapia, carp, catfish (including Pangasius), seabream and seabass, and molluscs. A few other minor productions such as milkfish were also included. The model was constructed to ensure consistency between the feed rations and the fishmeal and fish oil markets. Depending on the species, the feed rations can contain a maximum of five types of feed; fishmeal, fish oil, oilseed meals (or substitutes), vegetable oil and low protein feeds like cereals and brans. The methodology of stochastic simulations with Aglink-Cosimo The partial stochastic analysis highlights how alternative scenarios diverge from the baseline by treating a number of variables stochastically. The selection of those variables aims at identifying the major sources of uncertainty for agricultural markets. In particular, country specific macroeconomic variables, the crude oil price, and country- and product-specific yields are treated as uncertain within this partial stochastic framework. Apart from the international oil price, four macroeconomic variables are considered in all countries: the consumer price index (CPI), the gross domestic product index (GDPI), the gross domestic product deflator (GDPD) and the US-Dollar exchange rate (XR). The yield variables considered contain crop and milk yields in all model regions. The approach applied to determine the stochastic draws of these variables is based on a simple process which captures the historical variance of each single variable. The three main steps of the partial stochastic process are briefly explained below. 270  OECD-FAO AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK 2023–2032 © OECD/FAO 2023 (i) The quantification of the past variability around the trend for each macroeconomic and yield variable separately The first step is to define the historical trend of stochastic variables. Often a linear trend does not represent adequately observed dynamics. Consequently, a non-linear trend is estimated by applying a Hodrick\u0002Prescott filter, which seeks to separate short-term fluctuations from long-term movements.2 The filter is applied to the yield time series directly and to year-on-year changes for macro variables. (ii) The generation of 1 000 sets of possible values for the stochastic variables The second step involves generating 1 000 sets of possible values for the stochastic variables. For each year of the 2022-2031 projection period, one year of the historical period 1995-2021 is drawn. The relative deviation between the actual variable value of that year and the respective trend value estimated in step 1 is then applied to the value of the variable in the actual projection year. All variables thereby receive the value of the same historical year. The process, however, handles macro variables separated from yields, as both are not strongly correlated. (iii) The execution of the Aglink-Cosimo model for each of these 1 000 possible alternative sets of values (uncertainty scenarios) The third step involves running the Aglink-Cosimo model for each of the 1 000 alternative “uncertainty” scenarios generated in step 2. When both macroeconomic and yield uncertainty were included, this procedure yielded 98% successful simulations. The model does usually not solve all stochastic simulations as the complex system of equations and policies may lead to infeasibilities when exposed to extreme shocks in one or several stochastic variables. Notes 1 Trade data for regions, e.g. the European Union or regional aggregates of developing countries, refer only to extra-regional trade. This approach results in a smaller overall trade figure than cumulated national statistics. For further details on particular series, enquiries should be directed to the OECD and FAO Secretariats. 2 The filter was popularised in the field of economics in the 1990s in Robert Hodrick and Edward C. Prescott (1997), “Postwar U.S. Business Cycles: An Empirical Investigation”, Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, Vol. 29 (1), pp. 1–16, JSTOR 2953682. |274 Annex C.

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

While the establishment of the [**National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-disaster-management-authority-1) marked a positive step. The very nature of disasters has undergone a drastic shift. [**Extreme weather events**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/himalayas-more-prone-to-extreme-weather-events), often intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent and severe. New threats like [**heat waves**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/heat-waves-and-heat-index#:~:text=Heat%20wave%20is%20considered%20if,C%20to%206.4%C2%B0C.) are emerging, and even more concerning is the rise of **multi-hazard disasters**, leading to cascading effects and far greater destruction. In this critical scenario, reactive measures are no longer enough. India needs a **proactive approach** that prioritizes disaster preparedness. ### What is the Framework Related to Disaster Management in India? - **Disaster Management Act of 2005:** The [**Disaster Management Act of 2005**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/disaster-management-act-2005-invoked) has provided the legal and institutional framework for disaster management in India at national, state and district levels. - While the **primary responsibility of disaster management rests with the States**, the Central Government supports the efforts of State Governments by providing logistical and financial support. - **Institutional Framework under Disaster Management Act of 2005** : - **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA):** Apex body headed by the **Prime Minister,** responsible for policy, plan, and guideline formulation for disaster management (DM). - NDMA addresses both **natural and man-made disasters** and coordinates enforcement and implementation. - **National Executive Committee (NEC):** Assists NDMA, chaired by the Union **Home Secretary,** comprising various secretaries and officials. - Prepares and monitors the National Plan for DM and coordinates responses to disaster situations. - **State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA):** Headed by the **Chief Minister,** responsible for state-level DM policies and plans, coordinating implementation, and integrating mitigation measures in state development plans. - **District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA):** Led by the **District Collector** with an elected representative as Co-Chairperson. - Prepares and implements district-level DM plans and ensures compliance with national and state policies. - **Local Authorities:** Includes **[Panchayati Raj Institutions](https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/panchayati-raj-institution-pri), [Municipalities](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/urban-local-government-in-india)**, **District and Cantonment Boards**, and Town Planning Authorities.

Over **40 million hectares (12% of land)** are prone to floods and river erosion. It is getting exacerbated by [**Glacial Lake Outburst Floods.**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/glacial-lake-outburst-flood#:~:text=A%20glacial%20lake%20outburst%20flood,or%20the%20inflow%20of%20meltwater.) - **Examples:** Floods in **Bihar (2023), Assam** (2022) - **Cyclones and Storms**: India's coastline is susceptible to cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Of the **7,516 km long coastline**, approximately **5,700 km** is vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis. - **Examples: [Cyclone Biparjoy](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/india-s-cyclone-preparedness) (2023)** and **[Cyclone Fani](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-fani) (2019).** - **Earthquakes:** India is located in a seismically active region, with several fault lines running across the country. 58.6% of the landmass is prone to moderate to very high intensity earthquakes. - **Examples:** Earthquake in **Mizoram** (2022), Earthquake in **Sikkim** (2011) - **Droughts:** Prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall patterns can lead to severe [**droughts,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/drought-in-europe) affecting agriculture and water resources. **68%** of the cultivable area is susceptible to drought. - **Examples:** Drought in 66% of **Maharashtra** (2024). - **Landslides:** Hilly and mountainous regions in India are prone to [**landslides**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/landslide-atlas-of-india#:~:text=Landslides%20are%20natural%20disasters%20occurring,slope%20is%20termed%20a%20landslide.), especially during heavy rainfall or earthquakes. India is considered among the top five landslide-prone countries globally. - **Examples:** Landslides in **Himachal Pradesh (** 2023), Landslides in **Manipur** (2022). - **Heat Waves:** Rising temperatures and prolonged periods of high heat can lead to life-threatening heat waves. - **Examples:** Heat waves across India (2022, 2023, 2024). - The country reported **280 heat wave days** from 11th March- 18th May, 2022. - **Forest Fires:** Dry conditions and human activities can contribute to [**forest fires,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/forest-fires-9#:~:text=Also%20called%20bush%20or%20vegetation,e.g.%2C%20wind%2C%20topography).) causing environmental damage and air pollution. Based on the forest inventory records, **54.40% of forests in India** are exposed to occasional fires - **Examples:** Forest fires in **Himachal Pradesh (2024)** and Forest fires in **Goa** (2023). - **Industrial and Chemical Accidents:** India's growing industrial sector and improper handling of hazardous materials can lead to industrial and chemical accidents. - **Examples:** Chemical spill in **Surat** (2023), Industrial fire in **Mumbai** (2024). ### What Factors are Exacerbating India’s Disaster Risk? - **Urbanization and Unplanned Development:** Rapid urbanization and unplanned development in cities have increased the vulnerability to disasters like floods and earthquakes. - **Example:** The **2023 Chennai floods** were attributed to unchecked development and encroachment on water bodies and wetlands. - **Rising Climate Change Impact:** Climate change is amplifying the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, and droughts. - **Example**: The devastating [**Cyclone Amphan in 2020**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-amphan) was fueled by warmer ocean temperatures due to climate change. - **Aging Infrastructure and Lack of Maintenance:** India's aging infrastructure, such as **dams, bridges, and buildings, coupled** with inadequate maintenance, increases the risk of disasters. - The **Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water** in 2023 raised concerns over the safety of aging dams that are **more than 100 years old.** - **Environmental Degradation:** Activities like **deforestation, mining, and unsustainable land-use practices** have increased the risk of landslides and soil erosion. - **Example:** The [**2022 Joshimath land subsidence crisis**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/joshimath-land-subsidence) in Uttarakhand was attributed to unregulated construction and mining activities. - **Industrial and Technological Hazards:** India's growing industrialization and reliance on hazardous materials increase the risk of industrial accidents and chemical disasters. - **Example:** The gas leak at a chemical plant in **Visakhapatnam** (2020) exposed thousands to toxic fumes. ### What Measures Should India Adopt to Reduce Disaster Risk and Enhance Disaster Preparedness? - **Establish Dedicated Disaster Response Corridors:** Designate and develop dedicated disaster response corridors, including **road networks, rail links, and air routes,** to ensure uninterrupted access for emergency services and aid during disasters. - These corridors could be designed to be resilient to hazards and equipped with necessary infrastructure and resources for efficient disaster response. - **Promote Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure:** Mandate the adoption of disaster-resilient design and construction principles for all critical infrastructure projects, such as bridges, dams, power plants, and communication networks. - Implementing **stricter building codes** that mandate disaster-resistant construction using **earthquake-proof materials, fire-proof materials and wind-resistant designs**. - Additionally, offering tax breaks and financial assistance for retrofitting existing structures to improve their resilience. - **Develop Disaster-Resilient Agricultural Practices:** Promote the adoption of disaster-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crops, precision farming, and soil conservation techniques. - Learning from successful examples like **Burkina Faso's Zai pit farming technique,** which enhances soil moisture retention and crop yields during droughts. - **Promote Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR):** Integrate ecosystem-based approaches into disaster risk reduction strategies by conserving, restoring, and sustainably managing natural ecosystems like **forests, [wetlands](http://wetlands), and coastal habitats.** - These ecosystems can act as **natural barriers against hazards like floods, storms, and landslides,** while also providing co-benefits like carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. - **Strengthen Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems:** Develop robust, integrated early warning systems that can detect and provide timely alerts for multiple hazards, such as cyclones, floods, heatwaves, and landslides. - Leveraging advanced technologies like **[remote sensing](https://www.drishtiias.com/current-affairs-news-analysis-editorials/news-editorials/2023-05-12), AI, and [big data analytics](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper3/big-data-1)** to improve hazard monitoring, forecasting, and risk communication. - **Micronet Grids for Critical Infrastructure:** Establish localized, self-sufficient power grids powered by renewable sources like solar and micro-hydro for critical infrastructure like hospitals and communication systems. - This ensures continued functionality even during widespread power outages caused by disasters. - **Mental Health Response Teams:** Integrating mental health professionals into disaster response efforts to provide **psychological support** to survivors dealing with trauma, anxiety, and displacement. This can significantly improve long-term recovery outcomes. - **Enhanced Institutional Capacity:** The institutions must hire permanent workforce rather than contractual. - A permanent workforce allows for continuous **skill development, knowledge transfer, and institutional memory.** - This fosters a more capable disaster management system compared to relying on temporary staff who may lack experience. - Moreover, the Local bodies should be allocated a substantial **Disaster Readiness Reserve to complement disaster reactivity to proactive measures.** | | | --- | | **_Drishti Mains Question:_** Examine the factors contributing to India's increasing vulnerability to disasters.What measures should India adopt to enhance its disaster preparedness?? | ### UPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question (PYQ) ### _Mains:_ **Q.** Discuss the recent measures initiated in disaster management by the Government of India departing from the earlier reactive approach. **(2020)** **Q.** Vulnerability is an essential element for defining disaster impacts and its threat to people.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

    "full_text": "# India's Geographic Vulnerability to Climate Change Industry Updates 17 mins September 25, 2024 Manasvi Patel ## **World Environmental Health Day 2024** World Environmental Health Day 2024 focuses on the theme \"Environmental Health: Creating Resilient Communities through Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation.\" This theme underscores the critical need to enhance community resilience in the face of climate-related disasters, which have become increasingly frequent and severe due to global warming. By emphasizing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation, this year's theme calls for integrated approaches that not only protect public health but also ensure sustainable development. India's unique geography and climate make it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. With 27 out of 29 states and 7 union territories susceptible to natural hazards like floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes, the country faces an uphill battle against the devastating impacts of climate change. As World Environmental Health Day 2024 approaches, it's crucial for India to take bold steps to enhance community resilience and protect its vulnerable populations. ### Geographical Factors Contributing to Disaster Risk India's geographical factors significantly contribute to its disaster risk profile, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The combination of its diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors creates a complex landscape of [vulnerabilities](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf): - [**Earthquakes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.7059oimyb6r3): Approximately 58.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to earthquakes, with the country situated in a seismically active zone due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. - [**Coastal Vulnerability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.sipw79xc52s): India's coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, exposes it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. - [**Floods**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.af8gn4f1799i) and [**droughts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.xdkivgfc02df): about 40 million hectares (around 12% of the land) are prone to floods and river erosion, while 68% of cultivable land is vulnerable to droughts. - [**Landslides**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.kmor8crhvnf7) and avalanches: The hilly regions are also at risk from landslides and avalanches, further compounding the disaster risk faced by various communities across the nation. #### Seismic Activity India is situated at the convergence of several tectonic plates, making it prime for earthquakes. ~58% of the country’s landmass is classified as being at risk for earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. This seismic vulnerability is particularly pronounced in regions such as the Himalayan belt, which experiences tremors due to ongoing tectonic activity. ##### The Gujarat (Bhuj) Earthquake (2001) For instance, the [2001 Bhuj earthquake](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bhuj-earthquake-of-2001), which registered a magnitude of 7.7, resulted in over 20,000 deaths and injured more than 150,000 others. The earthquake affected approximately 28 million people, destroyed more than 400,000 buildings, with the telecom building collapsing, Bhuj was isolated from the rest of the state; the most seriously affected was the Kandla port (the busiest port in India) which caters to handling crucial imports of petroleum products, crude oil and chemicals and export of agricultural commodities, with about five of the 10 jetties damaged. Over 10,000 small and medium industrial units had to stop production due to damage to plants, factories, and machinery. The Indian State Department [estimates](https://www.adrc.asia/publications/recovery_reports/Gujarat.pdf) that the earthquake affected, directly or indirectly, 15.9 million people out of 37.8 million. The government estimated the direct economic loss at $1.3 billion, while estimates indicate this could be as high as $5 billion. Following the earthquake, emergency relief operations were launched by both government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs): - [ActionAid India](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/gujarat-earthquake-2001/) mobilized local community-based organizations to provide immediate assistance in the most affected areas, by establishing temporary shelters, distributed food and medical supplies, and set up psycho-social counseling services for survivors. - The government initiated a [comprehensive rehabilitation plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm) that included new building codesto ensure that the structures were designed to be earthquake-resistant; and infrastructure redevelopment of roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities was prioritized. - Emphasizing on community participation in planning and implementing disaster management strategies, village-level committees were formed to enhance local capacity for disaster response. - A [State Disaster Management Plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm#:~:text=Gujarat%20State%20Disaster%20Management%20Authority%20(GSDMA)%2C%20which%20would%20implement%20the%20reconstruction%20and%20rehabilitation%2C%20with%20support%20from%20various%20other%20agencies%20in%20the%20quake%2Dhit%20area.) was created that integrated lessons learned from the earthquake, and focused on risk assessment, early warning systems, and community-based disaster management practices aimed at reducing vulnerability to future seismic events. The resilience-building activities undertaken after the Gujarat earthquake reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate relief with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. These efforts underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in seismically active regions like India #### Coastal Vulnerability India's long coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, makes it highly vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis, [exposing](https://irade.org/Sustainable%20and%20Disaster%20Resilient%20Urban%20DevelopmentFinal%20.pdf) it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which have borne the brunt of devastating cyclones in recent years. ###### Cyclone Fani (2019) Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, serves as a prime example of the destruction that coastal areas face. The [extremely severe](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cyclone-fani-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment) cyclonic storm caused extensive damage across 14 districts in Odisha, [affecting](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2019-000041-ind) at least 10 million people in the North-eastern Sates of India. Despite the early evacuation of a million people, the cyclone has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of more than 28 million people across 3 States in India. [Total damage](https://ncds.nic.in/sites/default/files/OEDS3NCDS.pdf) to existing stock of assets has been estimated at over $2.4 billion, whereas the economic losses flowing from the disaster are estimated at nearly ~$1.1 billion. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, several resilience-building activities were implemented to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts: - [The Government of Odisha](https://www.unicef.org/media/82111/file/India-Cyclone-Fani-SitRep-12-May-2019.pdf) coordinated one of the largest emergency preparedness exercises, mobilizing over 45,000 volunteers and 100,000 officials to ensure effective communication and evacuation protocols. This effort enabled the successful evacuation of approximately 1.47 million people from low-lying areas before the cyclone made landfall. - The state government constructed hundreds of cyclone shelters along the coast to provide safe refuge during storms, which were stocked with essentials like food and water. - Local stakeholders, NGOs, and civil society organizations collaborated with the government to conduct training programs on disaster preparedness including educating communities about evacuation routes and safety measures The resilience-building activities undertaken after Cyclone Fani reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate response efforts with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. The lessons learned from this cyclone underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in coastal regions like Odisha. #### Flood-Prone Areas Over 40 million hectares (about 12% of India’s land) is [prone to floods and river erosion](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf). The monsoon season often brings heavy rainfall leading to river overflow and flash floods, particularly in states like Assam and Bihar. ##### Assam Floods (2023) Assam, a state in northeastern India, is characterized by its fertile Brahmaputra Valley, which supports a rich agricultural sector. The state’s agriculture is primarily based on rice, tea, and jute, and it benefits from the regular monsoon rains that sustain its crops. The geographical features of Assam, including its river basins and low-lying areas, contribute significantly to its susceptibility to flooding. In 2023, Assam experienced devastating floods that [impacted](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/india-whats-really-behind-assams-worsening-floods) over 2.5 million people. In response to the challenges posed by flooding, particularly following the severe floods in 2023, several resilience-building activities have been undertaken in Assam: - The Assam government allocated Rs 1200 crs in 2023-24 for the [construction and maintenance](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Development%3A%20The%20Assam%20government%20has%20allocated%20Rs%201%2C200%20crore%20for%20the%20construction%20and%20maintenance%20of%20flood%20control%20infrastructure%2C%20including%20embankments%20and%20flood%20barriers%2C%20for%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20period.) of flood control infrastructure, including embarkments and drainage systems and investment aimed to enhance the state's capacity to manage floodwaters effectively and reduce the risk of future inundations. - The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) invested ₹25 crores in developing advanced flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems provide alerts up to three days in advance, allowing communities to prepare for impending floods and evacuate if necessary. - The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) [covers](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=The%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Fasal%20Bima%20Yojana%20(PMFBY)%20covers%20around%2056%25%20of%20the%20farmers%20in%20Assam%20as%20of%202023.%20This%20scheme%20provides%20insurance%20coverage%20against%20crop%20losses%20due%20to%20natural%20calamities.) around 56% of farmers in Assam as of 2023, providing insurance against crop losses due to natural calamities. This scheme is crucial for protecting farmers' livelihoods and ensuring financial support during disasters. - A Community-Based Disaster Management project was launched in 2023, aimed at building local capacity for flood management in 100 selected gram panchayats focusing on on empowering communities with knowledge and resources to respond effectively to floods. In 2023, Assam introduced a ' [green budget](https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/09/28/improving-climate-resilience-in-flood-prone-assam-india/)' committing approximately $2 billion towards climate change action and disaster risk reduction, aiming to enhance long-term resilience against climate-related disasters through sustainable development practices. The resilience-building activities implemented in Assam following recent floods reflect a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, promoting community engagement, and introducing innovative financial mechanisms like insurance schemes and green budgets, Assam is working towards building a more resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding the impacts of flooding. #### Drought and Water Scarcity Drought and water scarcity are significant challenges in India, with [about](https://nidm.gov.in/pdf/trgReports/2021/July/Report_29July2021sk.pdf) 68% of the country's cultivable area vulnerable to these conditions. ##### Rajasthan Drought and Water Scarcity Rajasthan, the largest state in India, faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and drought leading to crop failures and economic distress among farmers. The state has [limited water resources](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/261801490687132806/pdf/113703-WP-Water-Assessment-and-Potential-for-Private-Sector-Interventions-PUBLIC.pdf), with only 1.16% of India's total water supply, making it particularly susceptible to prolonged drought conditions. It's among the most [vulnerable to droughts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/29/surajpura-rajasthan-india-drought-villagers-farmers-climate#:~:text=ajasthan%2C%20India%E2%80%99s%20largest%20state%2C%20is%20among%20the%20most%20vulnerable%20to%20droughts%2C%20with%2098%25%20of%20its%20250%20village%20blocks%20in%20sectors%20marked%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdark%20zones%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20areas%20with%20dangerously%20low%20groundwater%20levels%20%E2%80%93%20and%20almost%207%25%20of%20the%20land%20uncultivable), with 98% of its 250 village blocks in sectors marked as “dark zones” – areas with dangerously low groundwater levels – and almost 7% of the land uncultivable. In response to the recurring drought conditions, several resilience-building activities have been implemented in Rajasthan: - Rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques were introduced to mitigate the effects of droughts and were prioritized via traditional techniques such as Anictus, Bairis, and tanks. In 2023, after an [unusually high rainfall](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/climate-opportunity-how-did-rajasthan-harvest-rainwater-after-the-early-monsoon-of-2023--94579) of 588.9 mm (nearly 2X the normal amount) villagers utilized these methods to direct the water into ponds and storage system, providing drinking water [for upto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwXQurAJLKs) 1.5 years in some villages. - The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project, costing a total of $495 million, of which $345 million is [financed](https://www.ndb.int/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rajasthan-Water-00012.pdf) by the New Development Bank, aimed to rehabilitate the Indira Gandhi Canal System, covering over 990 km of canal systems, reclamation of more than 33,000 km of waterlogged areas, and implementation of micro-irrigation techniques. Government schemes like the [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana](https://pmksy.gov.in/) (PMKSY) were implemented to focus on enhancing irrigation facilities, along with the introduction of a crop insurance scheme to protect farmers from losses due to drought. Despite these resilience-building efforts, Rajasthan continues to face the challenges posed by recurring droughts. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by its arid climate, limited water resources, and high dependence on agriculture. Sustained efforts and investments in water management, and agricultural practices are crucial for mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring food security in the region. #### Topography and Landslides India's diverse topography includes mountainous regions that are particularly vulnerable to landslides and avalanches, especially during the monsoon season. The Himalayan region, along with the Western Ghats, experiences heavy rainfall that can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. One of the most devastating recent events occurred in Wayanad, Kerala, where a series of landslides on July 30, 2024, resulted in significant loss of life and property. ##### The Wayanad Landslides (2024) On July 30, 2024, Wayanad district in Kerala was struck by catastrophic landslides that resulted from extreme rainfall. [The region](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece) received 572 mm of rainfall within 48 hours leading up to the disaster, causing hillsides to collapse in the villages of Mundakkai and Chooralmala. This resulted in over 336 fatalities, ~397 were injured, and at least 118 missing. The debris flow altered the course of the Iruvanjipuzha River, exacerbating flooding conditions in surrounding areas. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) [reported](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/86000-sq-metres-of-land-slipped-away-debris-travelled-8-km-along-iruvanjippuzha-river-isro-satellite-images-reveal/articleshow/112231968.cms?from=mdr) that about 86,000 square meters of land had shifted due to the landslide. In response to the Wanayd landslides, several activities were initiated: - A [rescue operation](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece#:~:text=On%20August%201%2C%20Chief%20Minister%20Pinarayi%20Vijayan%20said%20over%209%2C300%20people%20were%20staying%20in%2091%20relief%20camps%20in%20Wayanad%20district.) was mobilized involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local authorities, over 9,300 people were accommodated in relief camps across the district. - [Experts](https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-on-the-trail-of-the-wayanad-landslide/) have called for implementing site-specific land-use policies and improving drainage management to mitigate future risks. Additionally, establishing local landslide early warning systems (LEWS) has been recommended to enhance community preparedness. The Wayanad landslides highlight the urgent need for improved land management practices and disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions of India. By implementing effective resilience-building strategies, including community engagement and infrastructure improvements, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of future landslides and protect lives and livelihoods. India's unique geographical factors significantly contribute to its vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors create a complex landscape of risks, including earthquakes, coastal vulnerability, floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events due to global warming. To address these challenges, India must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into its development plans. Building resilient communities requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes strengthening early warning systems, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and adopting sustainable practices.

    "full_text": "[Defense & Security](https://southasianvoices.org/sav_channels/defense-security) # India-Pakistan Cyber Skirmishes and the Challenge of Attribution Written by [Kashoon Leeza](https://southasianvoices.org/author/kashoon) October 7, 202513 min read **Editor’s Note:** _This essay is part of a series entitled “ [Cybersecurity Threats, Law, and Norms: Priorities for South Asia](https://southasianvoices.org/collection-cyber-south-asia/),” a collaboration between the Stimson Center [Cyber](https://www.stimson.org/program/cyber/) and [South Asia](https://www.stimson.org/program/south-asia/) programs._ The recent India-Pakistan crisis in May illustrated how cyber and artificial intelligence are being integrated into military combat in the subcontinent, a significant development for South Asia’s fragile strategic stability. Along with an exchange of drone strikes, conventional missile firings, and aerial dogfights, the skirmish continued in the information domain, with Pakistani media reporting that the country’s military cyber wing [disrupted](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546050/security-sources-reveal-details-of-pakistans-massive-cyberattack-against-india) a communications network in India, predominantly affecting power distribution lines and government websites. Meanwhile, hackers sympathetic to the Indian government [leaked](https://x.com/cyberforcex) compromised data from Pakistan’s taxation authority and [targeted](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/how-pro-india-hackers-defended-country-during-cross-border-cyberattacks-amid-op-sindoor/articleshow/121385229.cms) other digital infrastructure. The active incorporation of cyber operations in this recent crisis, at least as acknowledged in public media reporting on both sides, is a departure from the past. It also raises serious concerns about the challenge of attribution on the subcontinent. Assigning responsibility for cyber operations comes with political, legal, and technical challenges. For one, in hostile India-Pakistan ties, there is limited space to entertain an ill-substantiated or inaccurate attribution as it risks escalation or creates domestic pressure for retaliation. Also, public attribution may be limited by the lack of well-established national frameworks for doing so. Neither India nor Pakistan currently have an official public attribution policy, making it difficult to assess their evidentiary standards and the validity of their threat intelligence. Limited official documents on procedures for incident response and forensic capacity suggest caution with regard to the credibility of public attribution. Thirdly, in cyber geopolitics, public attribution is a strategic choice determined by decisionmakers on a case-by-case basis. Cyber operations work best when clandestine and thus attribution is often intentionally restricted to avoid exposing technical capability. This is likely why Pakistan and India have generally approached official public attribution for cyber operations with caution in the past. The deployment of cyber-attacks complementary to kinetic operations along with unverifiable and potentially premature public attribution could set a dangerous precedent for a strategic environment as hostile and fragile as South Asia. Thus, in the absence of credible attribution tools and mechanisms, Islamabad and New Delhi would have to firmly resolve to adhere to responsible state behavior in cyberspace by doing the following: 1) establishing a cyber hotline to ensure communication channels are open, 2) supporting the applicability of international law to cyberspace, and 3) committing to non-proliferation of intrusive cyber technologies to non-state Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to conduct cyber operations on their behalf. [\\[1\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn1) More broadly for each, institutionalizing their attribution process would ensure transparency and reassurance. **India and Pakistan’s Cyber Doctrines** Even apart from its prominent role in the recent India-Pakistan crisis, cybersecurity has found a significant place in both countries’ national security postures in recent years. In 2019, then Indian Minister of State for Defence [confirmed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-setting-up-of-defence-cyber-agency/articleshow/72264836.cms) the development of a defense cyber agency to handle cyber threats in a military context as well as budgetary allocations for cyber operations. In 2021, India’s former National Security Advisor acknowledged New Delhi’s capability to conduct “ [cyber sabotage and cyber warfare _._](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/M.-K.-Narayanan-on-India-Pakistan-diplomacy-and-terrorism/article55940567.ece)” And in 2024, the Indian Ministry of Defence [announced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms) a joint doctrine for cyberspace operations, shifting away from the country’s previous policy of strategic ambiguity on the use of cyber in the warfare domain, and integrating both [defensive and offensive capabilities](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2153626). [\\[2\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn2) While Pakistan does not have a pronounced cyber doctrine, Islamabad’s national security posture reflects the necessity of integrating cyber capabilities with military operations. Inaugurating the Army’s Cyber Division in 2018, the then Chief of Army Staff articulated that “ [firepower and cyber have emerged as the mainstay of future war.”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369646/firepower-cyber-have-emerged-as-mainstay-of-future-war-coas) Pakistan has also invested in cyber capacity, as the [2021 National Cybersecurity Policy](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) reiterates, to protect national critical infrastructure as well as government information systems. These policy documents underline that India and Pakistan recognize the importance of investing in cyber capability to uphold their national interests. The next section explores how each state potentially uses these capabilities for strategic gain. **Cyber Capability and Operations** Countries are increasingly employing state capabilities to conduct cyber operations to achieve strategic objectives such as intelligence gathering; Pakistan and India are no different. Over the past few years, each state is alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage. This is done either through state capability or threat actors backed by the state. Publicly available information suggests that [APT 36](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-36)—also known as [Transparent Tribe](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector/) and [SideCopy](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/operation_c-major)—is a Pakistan-linked APT group, alleged to have conducted cyber [espionage](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) particularly in India and Afghanistan. Likewise, APT groups such as [Sidewinder](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/#%3A~%3Atext%3DSidewinder%20is%20a%20suspected%20Indian%2CChina%2C%20Nepal%2C%20and%20Afghanistan) and [Patchwork](https://medium.com/@Ab_Hussain/indian-apts-target-middle-east-1e4a11b3ce95) are thought to be Indian state-backed threat actors, conducting cyber operations in Pakistan and elsewhere. > “Over the past few years, \\[India and Pakistan are\\] alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage.” While there is limited information publicly available regarding the cyber operations conducted by each side, some sources do point to state acquiescence or support. A report by a Canadian firm [revealed](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/media/27613/ocr) that in 2021, the Indian government had allegedly conducted [cyber surveillance](https://www.dawn.com/news/1636767) on Pakistan’s [political leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/) using the Israeli [Pegasus software](https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-pegasus-spyware/). India-based hacking groups reportedly continued to [target](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) Pakistani government entities in the following years aiming to infiltrate systems and access computer controls. Similarly, media reports claimed that Pakistan-based hackers had [deployed](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) malware against Indian government and defense sectors, attempting to gain access to sensitive information. In 2019, the cyber-attack on India’s nuclear facility, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, was thought by some [analysts](https://www.orfonline.org/research/decoding-motives-behind-the-kudankulam-intrusion-58083) to have been perpetrated by Pakistan, though there was no public attribution. The technical attribution by cybersecurity firms [pointed](https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/cyber-attack-on-kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant.pdf) to a North Korean state-sponsored entity, the Lazarus Group. This complex picture of the potential use of proxies points to the challenge of attribution in an India-Pakistan context. **The Attribution Challenge** Attribution in cyberspace is the process of identifying and assigning responsibility to threat actors behind the cyber operation or malicious activity. However, attribution is rarely straightforward because, unlike physical crimes, cyber actors can hide behind the anonymity of the internet or impersonate other computers. Threat actors can also remain in the system undetected, silently stealing information through stolen passwords or impersonation. In terms of technical challenges, the sophistication of the operation depending on capability could also make it difficult to trace the crime back to an actor. For instance, during the India-Pakistan crisis in May, the Indian cyber agency, Maharashtra Cyber, reported a significant surge in cyber-attacks [originating](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace#:~:text=noted%20a%20surge%20in%20DDoS,in%20these%20cyberattacks%20as%20it) from Pakistan as well as countries like Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh. Threat actors using the location of a third country is often a deliberate and popular tactic to confuse the perpetrator’s identity and origin, as an IP address is usually the first source of identification. A popular global example is the 2018 [Olympic Destroyer cyberattack in South Korea](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/olympic-destroyer/21494/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the,uproar%20was%20no%20laughing%20matter.), when the [Russian threat actors](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/) used sophisticated tactics to conceal their identity, enabling the blame to be deflected to North Korea and China. Thus, even if one actor might visibly be responsible, there might be someone else behind the keyboard. Moreover, technical attribution requires advanced threat intelligence capability, without which attribution could be erroneous and enable “false flag” categorization. For example, recently, Russian state-linked cyber group Turla allegedly attempted to access data exfiltrated from Indian military networks. Threat intelligence by Microsoft and Lumen’s BlackLotus Labs indicate that Turla [compromised a network](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) of Pakistan-based group SideCopy to spy on the Indian network. This created a false impression, shifting the blame towards Pakistan. This reiterates that the use of sophisticated techniques in an operation and the lack of advanced capability for forensic analysis can potentially obscure a threat actor’s identity, making attribution a challenge. Even advanced nations struggle with having requisite forensic capacity, so relatively newer cyber entrants like India and Pakistan will have to invest more efforts in this space. The key legal challenge India and Pakistan face regarding attribution is the lack of a transparent, and credible attribution framework. Unlike some countries, India and Pakistan do not have a formal attribution policy, making it difficult for independent analysts to assess the validity of their institutional processes. In practice, the process involves a loose [network of agencies](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/mapping-indias-cybersecurity-administration-in-2025?lang=en) coordinating technical and intelligence findings, raising concerns about the lack of consistent and verifiable evidentiary standards. It was in highlighting some of these challenges that Pakistan’s 2023 [position](https://docs-library.unoda.org/Open-Ended_Working_Group_on_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_-_(2021)/UNODA.pdf) on applicability of international law in cyberspace emphasized cross-border coordination and cooperation globally to ensure substantiated attribution. A lack of consistent evidentiary standards complicates attribution and can leave such efforts open to criticism as being politically motivated, making it critical for India and Pakistan to address this lacuna. This leads to the political challenge of attribution. The United States and [Five Eyes](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/fv-cntry-mnstrl-en.aspx) allies often attribute cyber-attacks when they need to reinforce international pressure on political adversaries or justify policy shifts. New Delhi and Islamabad have approached attribution rather cautiously. Though there are multiple reasons for this, the obvious one is to avoid jumping the gun and pointing to an adversary, which may create a particularly dangerous scenario of escalation. **Redefining Crises and Stability in South Asia** Attribution uncertainty creates costs for stability in South Asia and risks escalation in a future India- Pakistan crisis. Both countries share a hostile past and a tense strategic environment, leaving limited space for misunderstanding and miscalculation. A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing, tarnishing trust on both sides and instilling doubt. Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression. Pakistan’s 2021 Cyber Security Policy explicitly mentions that a cyberattack on critical infrastructure would be regarded as an [act of aggression](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) and be met with an appropriate response. > “A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing \\[…\\] Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression.” Another predicament is the question of proportionate response to an offensive cyber intrusion conducted by a state or state-linked threat actors without clear attribution. This is a conundrum faced by states globally, not just India and Pakistan. Determining what is a proportionate response in cyberspace currently lies at the discretion of the state. Some countries have included the principle of proportionality in formal statements unpacking how they interpret international law as applying to their conduct in cyberspace. According to its 2023 statement, while Pakistan acknowledges proportionality as applying in the context of conflict and international humanitarian law, it does not otherwise present views on response. India has not yet published a national statement. Such norms and behavior are either unaddressed or awaiting legal applicability in international frameworks. For the complicated security environment of South Asia, integration of cyber capability without legal clarity is thus worrisome. In times of active conflict, cyber operations, including information and influence operations, can create a [fog of war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQvsb4ouuI0) for decisionmakers and undermine the process of crisis management. Persistent cyber intrusions could also further compromise trust and impact and possibly backtrack the confidence-building measures (CBMs) already in place between India and Pakistan. Given that nuclear CBMs between India and Pakistan are already tenuous, a potential cyber-attack or even a data breach could be misperceived as altering the balance of power. **Policy Recommendations** To ensure that cyber does not introduce yet another element of uncertainty and that the precarious balance of power is maintained on the subcontinent, policymakers in India and Pakistan should: **_Establish a cyber hotline:_** Cyber operations can perpetuate misperception and misunderstanding, especially with attribution challenges. Therefore, rapid communication during a cyber crisis is critical. Both countries could exchange doctrines, ensure technical cooperation, and maintain a directory in case of crisis. Cyber CBMs, including hotlines and dedicated focal points for exchange, can also potentially enhance a sense of predictability. **_Support the applicability of international law to cyberspace:_** While there is consensus across the board that international law applies to cyberspace, states are still discussing how core legal principles and existing commitments, such as the non-use of force, proportionality, sovereignty, and due diligence, apply to cyberspace. Islamabad and New Delhi are advised to actively adhere to international and bilateral negotiations, such as the UN’s recently launched Global Mechanism on ICTs, successor to the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. Pakistan published its national position paper in 2023 outlining the applicability of international law. India could follow suit, to maintain accountability and transparency. **_Commit to restraining proliferation of offensive intrusion capabilities:_** To dodge attribution and accountability, states often employ non-state APT groups to influence cyber operations. This results in proliferation of sophisticated intrusive cyber technologies and capabilities to non-state threat actors, not bound by rules and norms of state responsibility. Cyber operations through non-state APT actors help maintain plausible deniability. India and Pakistan should refrain from transferring capabilities to non-state APT groups to ensure responsible state behavior and maintain stability. **_Institutionalize attribution:_** To ensure responsible state behavior, both India and Pakistan should consider improving their attribution process. Institutionalizing the process and detailing their evidentiary standards to substantiate the findings will build confidence in their intelligence and threat assessments. Publishing a national attribution policy would explain the objectives behind disclosing a breach or attack, beyond merely aiming for political scoring. Further, both states could also benefit from investing in legal and technical capacity-building for attribution, including in collaboration with private entities and multilateral partnerships. As their decades-long hostilities spill over into cyberspace, there is likely a higher probability of cyber operations increasing in an India-Pakistan context. Realizing the serious implications of cyber threats to strategic stability, Pakistan and India are advised to seriously engage in the measures above that would reduce misperception, increase accountability and transparency, and indicate their commitments to the norms and practices of international law and responsible state behavior during conflict and peace time. _Views expressed are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the positions of South Asian Voices, the Stimson Center, or our supporters._ Also Read: [Cyber Quicksand?

Defensive capabilities, as the name suggests, are used for building resilience. The aim is to build capacity to protect and respond, minimizing risks and mitigating cyber threats. Offensive capabilities are used to deny, disrupt, and degrade or destroy the adversary’s systems or networks for military or strategic purposes. However, the nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to neatly distinguish between offensive and defensive actions; some activities, like those carried out by security researchers for the purpose of testing for vulnerabilities, could be viewed as an offensive action. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Image 1: [blickpixel via Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/circuit-board-computer-chip-564814/) Image 2: [Great Norwegian Encyclopedia](https://snl.no/Kjernekraft_i_India) Posted in: [Crisis](https://southasianvoices.org/category/crisis/), [Cybersecurity](https://southasianvoices.org/category/cybersecurity/), [Escalation Control](https://southasianvoices.org/category/escalation-control/), [India](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india/), [India-Pakistan Relations](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india-pakistan-relations/), [Pakistan](https://southasianvoices.org/category/pakistan/), [Technology](https://southasianvoices.org/category/technology/) Share this: ## Subscribe to our newsletter Stay informed about the subcontinent.

Playing a key role in the stability of the European continent, existing interconnectors need to be secured from sabotage, and new projects need to be planned and deployed, especially in regions with the highest risk of technical or political incidents, such as the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe. - **Three blackouts** in the EUwere avoided or managed thanks to European interconnectors in the last 5 years. - **Ukraine and Moldova** would’ve faced severe power loss due to Russia’s aggression, if not for cross-border electricity exchange with EU neighbours. - **55% of Europe’s power system has limited electricity import options,** increasing the risk of blackouts. Spain, Ireland and Finland are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents. - **Nine recent cases of Baltic Sea infrastructure sabotage** show the need to protect Europe’s interconnection infrastructure. Europe’s energy infrastructure is under attack, with Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign escalating every day. Interconnectors form the backbone of energy security, safeguarding Europe against grid failures and geopolitical threats. The more interconnectors we have, and the better we secure our existing infrastructure, the safer we are in the face of sabotage. The expansion and security of European grids needs to be treated not as an energy priority, but as a vital element of protecting European society against attacks. **Dr Pawel Czyzak‍** Europe Programme Director, Ember Grid security is rudimentary to reducing Europe’s dependence on adversarial actors who have long used energy as a tool of economic coercion, dictating growth and productivity, and undermining stability across the continent. The much-needed push for low-carbon, domestic energy production must be matched by investment in grid modernisation to sustain large-scale electrification, strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy, and power its modern economy. **Isabelle Dupraz‍** Deputy Director, European Initiative for Energy Security ## **Interconnectors help stabilise or restart grids after faults** #### **Several examples show how interconnectors helped stabilise grids during incidents that could have otherwise had much more severe consequences.** ### European interconnectors made recent grid stress events less severe While European power systems maintain excellent reliability standards, multiple events in the past have put grids to a test. In those moments, interconnectors played a key role in stabilising the power systems and preventing widespread power cuts, or restarting the system if a blackout did occur. **Prevention: interconnectors helped avoid two potential blackouts in Poland** On 17th May 2021, a human error led to the malfunction of a high-voltage substation in Poland – Rogowiec. The substation feeds power from the largest power plant in the country – Bełchatów, into the Polish grid. The incident suddenly disconnected around 3.5 GW of capacity from the system and led to a [158 mHz](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2022/220318_Final_report_Rogowiec_incident.pdf) frequency drop, just shy of the [200 mHz buffer](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2019/190522_SOC_TOP_11.6_Task%20Force%20Significant%20Frequency%20Deviations_External%20Report.pdf) that would put the system in an emergency state. The Continental Europe Synchronous Area absorbed the frequency deviation by ramping up flows from neighbouring countries. These flows instantly reached [4.5 GW](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2022/220318_Final_report_Rogowiec_incident.pdf) – 2.3 GW more than allowed. Significant load appeared on power lines in Western Poland – 5 lines were operating at above 100% capacity, two of them above 120%, posing a risk of overloading. These violations were resolved by the Polish and German transmission system operators (TSOs), who limited flows and restored the frequency to nominal value within 30 minutes. Immediately after the incident, the Polish TSO requested emergency support from neighbouring countries to rebuild capacity reserves. Interconnectors were initially essential to prevent further frequency drops, the tripping of generators and cascading failures. Then they became key to rebuilding the system’s reserves while the grid malfunction was being removed. Another stressful event happened in Poland on 22nd June 2020, when heavy rainfall damaged coal supply lines. This, along with several other random failures, led to a record unplanned generation loss of [5.7 GW](https://bip.mos.gov.pl/fileadmin/user_upload/bip/Energetyka/Sprawozdania_z_wynikow_monitorowania_bezpieczenstwa_dostaw_energii_elektrycznej/Sprawozdanie_MKiS_z_monitorowania_bezpieczenstwa_dostaw_energii_elektrycznej_za_okres_2019-2020_tekst_ostateczny.pdf), equivalent to a quarter of that day’s peak demand. The event wasn’t as sudden as the one in 2021, and the frequency was not disrupted, so the incident didn’t require a formal investigation. However, the Polish TSO had to request emergency imports from neighbouring countries and deployed almost all coal plants available in “cold reserve” – plants used only in emergency situations. If interconnectors hadn’t provided [3 GW](https://www.next-kraftwerke.com/energy-blog/fossil-energy-poland) of power, a blackout would have been a real possibility. Only around [2 GW of coal and pumped-storage](https://wysokienapiecie.pl/30318-zalalo-elektrownie-prad-po-1300-zl-mwh/) capacity was left in the system, meaning 1 GW of demand could not have been balanced, leading to voluntary or forced reductions. **Stability: interconnectors filled France’s generation gap throughout 2022** France has recently faced major generation gaps due to nuclear plant outages. Historically, the country was the biggest exporter of electricity in Europe. However, in 2022, the total electricity generation dropped from 550 TWh in 2021 to 468 TWh – a decrease of 15%. Flows switched from [net exports of 42 TWh in 2021 to net imports of 17 TWh](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/european-electricity-review-2023/the-big-picture/#insight-1-the-fallacy-of-europes-return-to-coal). Peak imports reached 11 GW – 75% of the total interconnector capacity. In certain moments, imports covered up to 17% of the country’s peak electricity demand. While French nuclear has rebounded since 2022, the fleet still experiences outages, especially during [heatwaves](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/heat-and-power-impacts-of-the-2025-heatwave-in-europe/). In those moments interconnectors continue filling the capacity gaps, reducing price spikes as well. **Recovery: interconnectors restarted the Iberian grid after the blackout** On 28th April 2025, Spain and Portugal were hit by the largest blackout in Europe’s modern history, leaving around 60 million people without electricity for hours. [Multiple causes](https://www.compasslexecon.com/insights/publications/analysis-of-events-leading-to-the-peninsular-blackout-of-april-28th) led to the incident, and a final report by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) is due in October 2025. What is already certain is that, after the blackout, interconnectors were essential in restarting the Iberian power system. Just 10 minutes after the blackout, the first [France-Spain power line](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) was reenergised, soon joined by the interconnector with Morocco and other connections with France. With the help of hydro and gas units, a full restoration was achieved in Spain around 4 AM on 29th April, around 16 hours after the incident. The Iberian Peninsula is more vulnerable to blackout risks than other European countries due to limited connections to the continental grid. Following the blackout, Spain and Portugal urged the EU to [back new interconnector projects](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/spain-portugal-ask-eu-push-power-links-with-france-after-outage-2025-05-21/), citing stronger links as essential to preventing future disruptions. The 2021 blackout in Texas offers a stark warning of what can happen if connectivity isn’t sufficient. In February 2021, severe cold weather left more than 4.5 million people without power for several days, causing [250 deaths](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/02/texas-winter-storm-final-death-toll-246/). With peak demand above 70 GW but just 1 GW of interconnection, the state was unable to stabilise frequency deviations or replace the [34 GW](https://www.ferc.gov/media/february-2021-cold-weather-outages-texas-and-south-central-united-states-ferc-nerc-and) of missing capacity through imports, leading to a quick collapse. Restarting the system after the blackout was difficult as well – with fossil gas generators rendered unavailable, interconnectors could not be used to resynchronise the system, as was the case after the Iberian blackout. This is why exploring additional interconnection was one of the recommendations of the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission](https://www.ferc.gov/media/february-2021-cold-weather-outages-texas-and-south-central-united-states-ferc-nerc-and) that analysed the blackout. ### Up to 55% of Europe’s power system has limited electricity import options, increasing the risk of blackouts The more cross-border capacity a country has, the more stability can be provided by neighbours during grid stress events. This can be measured by the ratio of interconnector capacity (in the import direction) and a country’s peak electricity demand. This ratio varies from 12% in Poland, to almost 200% in Latvia – a country that has relatively small domestic demand, but supports electricity transits between Central Europe, the Baltics and the Nordics. However, there is no guarantee that imports from neighbours will be available instantly and at full capacity. That is why diversification is key: the more neighbours a country is connected to, the higher the chance that cross-border support can be provided on short notice. Summing the peak electricity demand of countries with three or fewer import directions and an import potential ratio of 25% or lower, up to 55% of Europe’s power system can be considered at risk due to limited emergency import options. Three countries – Spain, Ireland and Finland – are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents. ## Interconnectors provide security in times of uncertainty and war #### **Being essential for Europe during Russia’s aggression, interconnectors have also become targets of sabotage.** ### Interconnectors helped when power systems were attacked Interconnectors have a key role in stabilising power systems after a fault. But the past three years have also highlighted their other security feature – delivering stable electricity even during war. **Keeping the grid alive during Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure** Before 2022, Ukraine’s power system was connected to the Russian and Belarusian ones. On the day of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine requested an emergency synchronisation with the European power system. This was achieved in a record time of just [3 weeks](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/2-years-ukraine-and-moldova-synchronised-electricity-grids-eu-2024-03-15_en). This proved to be a critical security move since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine included [multiple attacks](https://dixigroup.org/en/over-two-years-russia-has-carried-out-25-massive-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-sector/) on energy infrastructure. By May 2024, about [70% of Ukraine’s thermal generation capacity was either occupied or damaged](https://www.iea.org/reports/ukraines-energy-security-and-the-coming-winter/ukraines-energy-system-under-attack), compromising the country’s ability to meet domestic demand. Fortunately, up to [2.4 GW](https://ember-energy.org/data/europe-electricity-interconnection-data-tool/) of import capacity was available for Ukraine – equivalent to 20% of the peak demand – including emergency response schemes by neighbouring grid operators. Thanks to interconnectors, during the [most severe attacks](https://map.ua-energy.org/en/datasets/12f3148d-841a-478d-b9ed-72bf0764b286) on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in 2024, Ukraine imported over 800 GWh of electricity a month, though a capacity gap still remained, leading to [local power cuts](https://www.iea.org/reports/ukraines-energy-security-and-the-coming-winter/ukraines-energy-system-under-attack). Imports totalled 4 TWh in 2024, a striking shift from Ukraine’s historical role as an exporter of around 2 TWh of electricity a year in pre-war 2020 and 2021. **Stabilising Moldova ahead of parliamentary elections** Similarly to Ukraine, Moldova’s power system used to be synchronised with Russia and Belarus. In 2022 it also went through an emergency synchronisation process, using interconnectors with Romania – which again proved to be an effective security move. On 31st December 2024, Russia stopped supplying gas to Moldova’s largest power plant, in an effort to destabilise the country ahead of parliamentary elections. Moldova was forced to source up to [62%](https://adevarul.ro/stiri-externe/republica-moldova/criza-energetica-in-rep-moldova-o-mare-parte-2412020.html) of electricity demand from Romania. Fortunately, thanks to grid investments, Moldova’s energy security will soon be strengthened. A new interconnection, [Vulcanesti – Chisinau](https://ipn.md/en/the-vulcanesti-chisinau-highway-will-be-completed-by-the-end-of-the-year-says-the-minister/), is due to be deployed by the end of 2025, providing up to 80-90% of Moldova’s peak demand in emergency situations and ensuring independence from Russia. [Two other interconnectors](https://old.gov.md/en/content/construction-balti-suceava-power-linemodernization-balti-power-station-declared-national) are being constructed, Balti-Suceava, due in 2027, and Straseni-Gutinas, due in 2030, allowing for the full integration of Moldova with the European power grid. **Shielding Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from Russia’s energy blackmail** Once reliant on Russia’s power grid, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were [fully synchronised](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/02/09/entso-e-confirms-successful-synchronization-of-the-continental-european-electricity-system-with-the-systems-of-the-baltic-countries/) with Europe’s grid and decoupled from Russia on 9th February 2025. The [Baltic Synchronisation](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/cef-energy-instrumental-funding-achieve-baltic-synchronisation-continental-european-network_en) was one of the EU’s biggest grid projects, receiving 1.2 billion EUR of support from the Connecting Europe Facility. The decoupling of Baltic States from Russia was made possible thanks to [new cross-border connections](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/timeline-phases_en) between Poland and Lithuania ( [LitPol Link](https://tyndp-data.netlify.app/tyndp2018/projects/projects/123)), and between Estonia and Latvia, as well as existing connections between Estonia and Finland ( [EstLink and EstLink 2](https://www.nib.int/articles/estlink-2-to-tie-baltic-power-producers-closer-to-the-nordic-markets)), and Lithuania and Sweden ( [NordBalt](https://www.nkt.com/references/nordbalt-the-baltic-sea)). To further strengthen the energy security of the Baltics, a new interconnector between Lithuania and Poland is being planned: [HarmonyLink](https://www.pse.pl/web/pse-eng/-/pse-and-litgrid-signed-cooperation-agreement-to-build-harmony-link-interconnector-as-overland-line), due in 2030. ### Infrastructure sabotage is now a key threat Because interconnections play a key role in Europe’s security, they’ve recently come under attack. Since 2022, [nine incidents](https://gbv.wilsoncenter.org/article/mapping-undersea-infrastructure-attacks-baltic-sea) of infrastructure damage have been recorded in the Baltic Sea. These include five cases of communication cable disruption, and damage done to the Nord Stream and Balticconnector gas pipelines and the EstLink 2 power cable. The damage done to the EstLink 2 interconnector by a [Russian shadow-fleet vessel](https://www.euronews.com/2025/08/11/finland-charges-officers-of-russia-linked-eagle-s-ship-that-damaged-undersea-cables) decreased Estonia’s electricity import capacity by 27% just two months before the full [decoupling of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from the Russian power grid](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/02/09/entso-e-confirms-successful-synchronization-of-the-continental-european-electricity-system-with-the-systems-of-the-baltic-countries/). Baltic Sea energy infrastructure is not the only one at risk. In April 2025, Russian hackers disrupted the operations of a [Norwegian hydropower facility](https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-hackers-took-control-norwegian-dam-police-chief-says/). In September 2025, over the span of just two days, a train carrying liquified gas [exploded near Vilnius](https://www.reuters.com/world/gas-explosion-prompts-lithuania-evacuate-residents-near-vilnius-rail-station-2025-09-10/), high-voltage lines were disrupted in an [arson attack](https://tvpworld.com/88818837/suspected-arson-attack-triggers-berlin-blackout), causing a partial blackout in Berlin, [19 Russian drones breached Polish airspace](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/poland-downs-drones-its-airspace-becoming-first-nato-member-fire-during-war-2025-09-10/) and [Israel carried out attacks in Qatar](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crme74p9gn2o) – one of Europe’s key gas suppliers. Since the start of the war in 2022, Russia-attributed [hackers](https://www.knowbe4.com/hubfs/Europe-Energy-Report-UK-EN.pdf) have targeted energy companies all across Europe, and globally, the [frequency of cyberattacks on energy utilities has doubled since 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/ai-and-energy-security), according to the International Energy Agency. Energy supply is critical not only for civilian life, but also for military response, and [energy infrastructure remains a major target](https://theopportunity.pl/en/publications/report-will-the-sea-help-the-baltic-sea-and-polands-energy-security/), as shown by examples from Ukraine and Russia’s [hybrid warfare](https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/08/the-scale-of-russian--sabotage-operations--against-europes-critical--infrastructure/) campaign in Europe. In the context of the Baltic power system, the role of cross-border interconnectors goes far beyond standard grid functions — they form the backbone of regional energy sovereignty and systemic resilience. The Baltic is no longer just a geographic area – it is becoming the integrated power plant of Northern and Eastern Europe, built on mutual support and diversified energy sources. Protecting this infrastructure must therefore go beyond the energy sector itself — it should be treated as part of NATO’s collective defense and the EU’s security architecture. **Zuzanna Nowak‍** Executive Director, The Opportunity Institute for Foreign Affairs ## Europe’s interconnectors need boosting and securing #### **Interconnectors are key in guaranteeing grid resilience, energy security and, more broadly, Europe’s safety. To continue providing stability against grid failures or geopolitical threats, two sets of actions need to be taken: the expansion of interconnector capacity and better security of existing infrastructure.** The upcoming [European Grid Package](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14672-European-grid-package_en) presents a timely opportunity to strengthen political commitment around both areas. European interconnection capacity is expected to [almost double](https://ember-energy.org/data/europe-electricity-interconnection-data-tool/) between 2024 and 2040, or even triple if all currently planned projects were delivered on time. Priority should be given to areas with limited connectivity and high exposure to potential disruption – such as the Iberian Peninsula, Eastern Europe and Finland.

By [Michael Fisher](https://www.itnews.asia/author/michael-fisher--1955979)on Oct 7, 2025 3:09PM The recent surge in cybersecurity incidents across the Asia Pacific region is now forcing a redefinition of what constitutes \"critical infrastructure.\" While energy grids, transport systems, and healthcare networks remain key targets, the latest attacks in aviation, retail, and financial services show that any network underpinning public safety, economic activity, or essential services can now be considered critical. In Australia, the Qantas breach exposed the personal information of over 5.7 million customers via a third-party system. In Singapore, nation-state actors like UNC3886 have been identified as actively targeting systems tied to national infrastructure. In India, ransomware has brought entire hospital systems and telecom providers to a standstill - disrupting care, communication, and public access. Even Google has now succumbed to a data breach. A growing concern is that this is not limited to large organisations. Cybercriminals are equally targeting small enterprises to gain access to larger corporate systems, as demonstrated by recent breaches of small to mid-size accounting and legal firms. These threats are also no longer confined to traditional IT environments, especially as digital and physical environments continue to converge. Operational Technology (OT) networks that are used to control machinery, industrial processes, and physical infrastructure are increasingly network-connected and vulnerable. Unlike IT systems, OT networks often lack built-in redundancy and can’t tolerate downtime, making them uniquely fragile in the face of modern cyber threats. > #### The increasing and high reliance on digital infrastructure across sectors like banking, retail, and logistics has elevated the criticality of their IT environments. A data centre failure or traffic outage can have the wide-ranging and same societal and economic impact as a disruption to water or energy supply. > > _- Michael Fisher, Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ **The stakes are now higher than ever** As Singapore, India and Australia continue to digitalise core infrastructure and embrace smart systems, ensuring uninterrupted visibility across both IT and OT environments is emerging as a national priority for each country. Whether it’s a power grid in India, a port terminal in Singapore, or an airline in Australia, cyber resilience now depends on having the right architectural foundation – one that offers full visibility, supports zero-trust principles, and maintains uptime across the entire security stack. Governments and enterprises are realising the critical need for better network visibility, security and uptime that spans both digital and operational domains. This is because the next wave of attacks won't distinguish between IT and OT, so Asia Pacific organisations need to ensure their cyber defences are ready. **How can you bridge the IT–OT divide** Many organisations still depend on legacy security tools and operate without full packet visibility or the ability to monitor encrypted traffic. Even inline tools that are used to detect threats can create single points of failure if they’re not architected for continuous uptime. This vulnerability is amplified in OT, where patching or updates may require physical access to remote or sensitive facilities. A way around this lies in adopting highly resilient infrastructure that delivers real-time monitoring with zero disruption. This includes reliable network test access points (TAPs), network packet brokers, and hardware data diodes built for extreme operating conditions, along with inline bypass capabilities that ensure systems remain operational even when security tools fail or require maintenance. A good example of how this works in an organisational context is electrical utilities. As more electricity providers implement cybersecurity solutions inside substations, additional precautions must also be taken to protect infrastructure from sophisticated attacks. To address this, utilities need to look at: - Implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that passively monitors network traffic. - Ensuring that malicious code does not gain access to a substation’s network through the use of cost-effective hardware diodes and data diode TAPs. These provide an additional layer of security before connecting an IDS to a SPAN/Mirror port on a network. For example, a hardware data diode enforces unidirectional data flow so that information flows from sensitive environments, such as critical infrastructure, without the possibility of inbound threats. This one-way communication preserves the integrity of secure zones. There are situations where the use of SPAN/Mirror ports is still needed to connect the IDS to the substation’s network. In these instances, it is best practice to connect a hardware data diode between the SPAN/Mirror port and the IDS to pass the mirrored data onto the IDS sensor. This is because hardware data diodes eliminate bidirectional traffic flow, ensuring that no data is passed back into the Switch’s SPAN/Mirror port. In utilities and other key infrastructure, the use of inline bypass solutions is crucial in enabling organisations to update, test or maintain inline cybersecurity tools without taking them offline and risking exposure to potential cyberattacks. Inline bypass tools are also designed to ensure full network traffic visibility while minimising disruption during system updates and maintenance. With the line between what is and isn’t critical infrastructure continuing to blur, one thing is clear: future-readiness demands full-spectrum visibility, operational uptime, and the resilience to respond to the unexpected. The question that C-level executives of Asia Pacific organisations must now be prepared to answer confidently is whether their IT architecture is resilient enough to withstand a sophisticated cyberattack. _Michael Fisher is the Regional Vice President Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ To reach the editorial team on your feedback, story ideas and pitches, contact them [here](mailto:editors@itnews.asia). © iTnews Asia Tags: [garland technology](https://www.itnews.asia/tag/garland-technology) [security](https://www.itnews.asia/security) ### Most Read Articles [**PhilHealth estimates 13 to 20 million members affected by data breach**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/philhealth-estimates-13-to-20-million-members-affected-by-data-breach-601471) [**IMDA and Enterprise Singapore launch SME-focused cybersecurity initiative**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/imda-and-enterprise-singapore-launch-sme-focused-cybersecurity-initiative-620891) [**Indonesia's national data centre suffers ransomware attack**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/indonesias-national-data-centre-suffers-ransomware-attack-609146) [**Ransomware gang Qilin claims attack on Japan’s Asahi breweries**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/ransomware-gang-qilin-claims-attack-on-japans-asahi-breweries-620895)",

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

    "full_text": "by [Gyana Swain](https://www.csoonline.com/profile/gyana-swain-2/) # Chinese hackers breached critical infrastructure globally using enterprise network gear News Sep 29, 20255 mins Cyberattacks[Security](https://www.csoonline.com/security/) ## RedNovember group exploited VPN appliances and firewalls to hit defense contractors, government agencies, and manufacturers in a year-long espionage campaign. Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

In this Q&A, Crisis Group expert Praveen Donthi delves into what caused the unrest and what New Delhi could do to stop it._ **What happened?** At least 150 people have been killed in clashes between the Meitei and Kuki ethnic groups that have engulfed India’s north-eastern state of Manipur, on the border with Myanmar. The violence broke out in Churachandpur, a town just south of the state capital Imphal, on May 3, following a Kuki-led tribal solidarity march in ten of the state’ssixteen districts. As the Meitei organised counter-protests and blockades, clashes spread across Manipur. Women were part of some of the mobs. In some cases, [they blocked soldiers trying to intervene](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-army-uses-drones-to-monitor-mobs-of-women-who-are-blocking-roads), in order to shield Meitei men conducting attacks. Thousands have been injured and more than 60,000 displaced in the violence; more than 12,000 have fled to the neighbouring Mizoram state. Hundreds of houses, places of worship and vehicles have been vandalised, and thousands of weapons stolen from government armouries. Arson and other attacks continue unabated. Numerous serious cases of sexual violence by Meitei men, militias and militants against Kuki women have also been reported, and all available evidence points to the widespread use of sexual violence as part of the ethnic conflict. Fake news about a Meitei woman’s rape in a Kuki-dominated area provoked a violent reaction from the Meitei community. A video [went viral online on July 19](https://thewire.in/communalism/manipur-video-two-kuki-women-paraded-naked-gang-raped) showing a mob of Meitei men parading and groping two naked Kuki women on a rural road before taking them to a field, where one of them was reportedly raped. The video triggered outrage throughout India, with protests organised in various cities. Responding to questions from a television news channel, Manipur chief minister N. Biren Singh acknowledged that there had been “[hundreds of such cases](https://thewire.in/rights/manipur-video-arrest-biren-singh-supreme-court)”. The government has been unable to bring the situation under control, despite taking drastic measures. The state government shut down the internet, imposed a curfew and authorised all district magistrates to issue [“shoot-on-sight orders” in “extreme cases”](https://thewire.in/government/manipur-govt-issues-shoot-at-sight-orders-in-extreme-cases-amid-violence). The federal government dispatched some 50,000 security personnel, most of them from other regions. It also set up a unified command for the various security forces deployed in the state. But all this action was to little avail. Manipur is now divided into exclusive ethnic zones, with the dominant, largely Hindu Meiteis concentrated in the valley where the state capital sits and the mostly Christian Kukis living in the surrounding hills. ![](https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/27113924/Manipur-relief-map.jpg) Relief map of Manipur.

They now patrol the buffer zone created in between, while the militias that have formed on both sides dig trenches and [wait for an opportunity to attack](https://apnews.com/article/india-manipur-ethnic-violence-ed5b68efb55190de3539543955f56a92). The state’s police force, which like the rest of the local administration is made up largely of Meiteis, has also been segregated, with Kuki members either being transferred or spontaneously fleeing to Kuki areas. Just over two months into the crisis, the physical – and emotional – separation of the communities is total. International concern about the Manipur violence has been muted so far, though on July 13 the European Parliament [passed a resolution](https://thewire.in/diplomacy/european-parliament-adopts-resolution-manipur-protection-religious-minorities) asking the Indian government “to take all necessary measures and make the utmost effort to promptly halt the ongoing ethnic and religious violence”. The resolution also asked the government to end the internet shutdown and to grant unhindered access to journalists and international observers. “Such interference in India’s internal affairs is unacceptable, and reflects a colonial mindset”, the Indian government snapped. **What is the background to the crisis?** The fighting pits the Meitei, who make up 53 per cent of the state’s 2.85 million population, according to the last census in 2011, but occupy only 10 per cent of its land, against the Kuki and 33 other tribes, which constitute about 30 per cent of the population and are geographically more spread out in the poorer hill areas. The conflict stems from [decades of contestation over land and natural resources](https://thewire.in/communalism/manipur-melting-pot-boiling-cauldron), fuelling deep-seated resentment among both the Meiteis and Kukis. Manipur is one of seven states in India’s Northeast region, often referred to as the “seven sisters”, which are connected to the rest of the country by a narrow strip of land that skirts Nepal and Bangladesh. The region, which consists of a mosaic of ethnicities, languages and cultures, many of them tribal, is home to some of India’s oldest separatist insurgencies. Many of these erupted soon after independence in 1947, partly as a result of the administrative chaos the British colonial rulers left behind. Today, most of the region’s insurgencies are dormant, limited to practicing extortion or stuck in various stages of slow-moving peace processes. Some of the remaining armed groups now operate largely from rear bases on the other side of the porous Myanmar border. ![Indian army personnel walking along the India Myanmar border.

Photo: PTI Though, as noted, the Kukis are mostly Christian and the Meitei mostly Hindu (small numbers of Meiteis are Christian or Muslim), the violence has occurred over ethnic rather than religious divides. The Nagas, another tribal community in Manipur that is mostly Christian, have not been involved at all, while Kukis have attacked fellow Christians who are Meitei living in or near majority-Kuki areas. Some Meitei leaders have nonetheless been trying to portray the turmoil as religious, seemingly for reasons having to do with national politics: they are trying to rally support among Hindus elsewhere in India, including within the federal government, which is run by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). According to available evidence, the Meiteis appear to have been the more aggressive side. As Manipur’s largest community, they enjoy immense social, political and economic advantages, not least dominating the state government, and therefore its police force, which gives them an upper hand in the conflict. **What was the immediate trigger for the violence?** The Kukihave long been recognised as a Scheduled Tribe under Indian law, an affirmative action measure that assures tribal community members access to state-run educational institutions, government jobs and safeguards such as the exclusive right to buy and own land in the state’s recognised tribal areas. The Meitei also enjoy certain benefits on account of being recognised as a “socially and economically backward class”, and a tiny segment of them as a Scheduled Caste. But they have been demanding the tribal status instead, arguing that it is necessary to “preserve” the community and “[save \\[its\\] ancestral land, tradition, culture and language](https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/northeast-meitei-st-demand-manipur-hc-8581664/)”. The demand has gained momentum only in the last few years. The Kuki, however, argue that the more numerous Meitei are already privileged. The minority fears that if the Meitei get Scheduled Tribe status, they will not only corner the reserved government jobs but also start acquiring land in the hills, displacing Kukis and other tribal communities. What set off the series of protests culminating in clashes and sexual violence was a Manipur high court ruling in favour of the longstanding Meitei demand. The court made its decision in late March, but it became public only on April 19, when the judgment appeared on the court’s website. The Supreme Court on May 17 stayed the Manipur court order, [calling it “completely factually wrong”](https://thewire.in/law/supreme-court-manipur-hc-meitei-scheduled-tribes-list), but that did not calm tempers. The violence is also related to the civil war raging in neighbouring Myanmar since shortly after its [February 2021 coup](https://thewire.in/world/no-end-in-sight-the-continuing-conflict-in-myanmar-two-years-after-military-coup). Chin refugees from Myanmar have reportedly been seeking shelter in Manipur (though in fewer numbers than in the adjacent state of Mizoram). In justifying their demand for Scheduled Tribe status, the Meitei claim that “[illegal immigration from Myanmar \\[and\\] Bangladesh](https://theprint.in/india/flow-of-refugees-from-myanmar-reignites-ethnic-strains-in-insurgency-battered-manipur/1443271/)” is threatening their position. Radical Meitei outfits such as Arambai Tenggol and Meitei Leepun accuse the Kuki, who share an ethnic heritage with the Chin, of illegally settling refugees in Manipur’s hills (according to official figures, there are 10,000 Chin refugees in the state). [iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDJnPewUhmU) Biren Singh, himself a Meitei and a BJP member, has echoed these allegations as well as others, implying that the Kuki are involved in the illegal drug trade, including poppy cultivation, in collaboration with transnational networks operating from Myanmar. Some Kuki criminal groups are in fact running drugs, but they are just one of [many players in the illicit business](https://thewire.in/rights/manipur-violence-claims-counterclaims-meitei-kuki), who also include Meiteis and Nagas. These allegations added to longstanding animosity between the two communities. The Meitei have long alleged that the Kuki are not indigenous to Manipur but were resettled in the state by the British from the nearby hills of Myanmar in the nineteenth century. Trouble has been brewing since August 2015, when a former state government, also headed by a Meitei, passed three laws that tribal communities perceived as designed to favour the Meitei. The tribes saw these laws as an attempt by the Meitei to acquire the power to buy land in the hills and sow doubt about the citizenship of tribal groups. In the ensuing demonstrations, the security forces killed nine young people belonging to the tribes in Churachandpur. As a mark of protest, the Kuki and other tribal groups [refused to bury the dead](https://scroll.in/article/766827/why-this-town-in-manipur-refuses-to-bury-nine-people-who-died-two-months-ago), keeping them in the morgue for two years. After a new state governmentheadedby Biren Singhcame to power in 2017, it signed (under the guidance of the federal government) an agreement with tribal leaders to restore quiet. But things soon deteriorated again, particularly after Biren Singh’s government won a second term in 2022. The government started evicting primarily Kukivillagers from houses and villages allegedly built on forest land in violation of the Indian forest law. ![](https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/30163218/FwqAt6VXsAIGp1_.jpeg) Manipur chief minister N. Biren Singh. Photo: Twitter/@NBirenSingh The Kuki, who believe the Meitei chief minister has been acting in a partisan manner, again mounted a series of protests, some of which turned violent. The high court order was therefore just the spark in an already combustible situation. **Is there a link to Manipur’s insurgencies?** Manipur is home to more than 30 ethnic rebel groups, all made up primarily of men, who were originally all fighting for homelands of their own. They can be broadly divided into three categories: Naga, Meitei and Kuki. The Naga outfits, which also operate in the neighbouring state of Nagaland, were the first to arise as organised armed insurgents, in the 1950s. The main faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, the biggest Naga insurgency, struck a ceasefire agreement with the federal government in 1997, and is still in talks with New Delhi. The Meitei groups, which appeared soon after the Naga militant outfits, have not entered into peace discussions, though they are much less active than in the past. The security forces refer to them as “valley-based insurgent groups”. The Kuki militant groups emerged only in the early 1990s, as a response to Naga attacks, but they signed a tripartite Suspension of Operations agreement with the federal and state governments in 2008. Since then, the Kuki militantshave been confined to thirteen camps, with their arms under lock and key. But the two Kuki umbrella militant groups that signed the agreement, the Kuki National Organisation and the United People’s Front, had to wait until 2017 for New Delhi to start actual peace talks. During these talks, the Kuki demanded the creation of territorial councils that would grant more autonomy to tribal communities in Manipur. Negotiations are proceeding slowly. ![](https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/27131331/Kuki-National-Organisation.jpg) Members of the Kuki National Organisation. Photo: Facebook/Kuki National Organisation-KNO Dept.of Defense, January 21, 2019. Much weakened, the remaining Meitei and Kuki militants have diluted their initial demands. They engage mainly in extortion, rather than rebellion, and play an active role in mainstream politics, though some continue to seek various degrees of autonomy within India’s federal structure. The legacies of these insurgencies, however, haunt the state’s political and social life, including amid the present unrest. Despite evidence pointing to radical Meitei outfits Arambai Tenggol and Meitei Leepun as the main culprits in starting the clashes, on May 28, Biren Singh tried to ascribe responsibility to Kuki militants. “The fight is between the state and central forces \\[and\\] the terrorists who are trying to break Manipur”, [he said](https://indianexpress.com./article/india/renewed-clashes-between-militants-and-security-forces-in-manipur-8633702/), telling the media security forces had killed 40 Kuki insurgents who were attacking Meitei civilians with sophisticated weapons. “It is not a fight between communities”, he asserted. [He was contradicted two days later by the Indian army’s top general, Chief of Defence Staff Anil Chauhan](https://thewire.in/security/chief-of-defence-staff-contradicts-manipur-cms-claim-that-violence-isnt-between-communities), who said: “This particular situation in Manipur has nothing to do with counter-insurgency and is primarily a clash between two ethnicities”. Earlier, Singh had accused Kuki militants of fomenting violence to protest his government’s eviction drive, and even attempted to pull out of the tripartite peace talks, but backtracked when the federal government opposed it. The violence threatens to reignite separatist fires. Now physically separated from the Meitei, the Kuki have resurrected an old demand to create an autonomous administrative unit with its own elected representatives and laws within Manipur. On May 12, all the Kuki members of the state assembly [issued a statement](https://thewire.in/government/manipur-violence-kuki-zomi-mlas-separate-administration) reading “to live amid the Meiteis again is as good as a death for our people”. [iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-r6_BeyD_I) In Mizoram, the violence has rekindled support for a separate homeland for the Kuki-Chin-Mizo ethnic group, which is spread across India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The unrest has also had consequences in Myanmar, where both Meitei and Kuki militant groups have rear bases. Since the February 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military regime has reportedly roped in groups from both ethnicities, though mostly Meiteis, to support its security forces in fighting the new armed opposition, in return for giving them safe haven. Allegiances have shifted since the Manipur conflict erupted, however, partly because Chin fighters ethnically related to the Kuki constitute much of the Myanmar resistance in areas near the border. These rebel groups are now aiding the Kuki in the Manipur conflict, while the Myanmar military regime is backing the Meiteis. There are unconfirmed reports of arms being smuggled into Manipur for the benefit of both sides. **Why are the authorities unable to bring the situation under control?** Despite the obvious risks, Manipur’s state government failed to put adequate security measures in place ahead of the tribal solidarity march on May 3, and thus it let the situation spin out of control throughout the state. Had it deployed sufficient forces on the day of the march at all the sensitive locations along its route, it might have helped temper the initial outbreak of violence. The most damage occurred in the first three days, when 72 people were killed, of whom 60 were reportedly Kukis living in the Imphal valley. Mobs of Meitei men targeted government armouries from the very day of the march, leading to suspicions that these attacks may have been orchestrated. The state police, which like the rest of the local administration are overwhelmingly Meitei, are alleged to have allowed the crowds to abscond with weapons such as assault rifles, long-range guns and even 51mm mortars. In Kuki-dominated areas, Kuki police officers allegedly did the same, albeit on a much lesser scale. An estimated 4,000 weapons and half a million bullets were stolen throughout the state. As a result, both communities have an arsenal at their disposal, which has escalated the intensity of the conflict manifold. ![](https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/19203619/FyQ9vBxaIAAY1u3.jpg) Gun drop box placed in Imphal Manipur.

Placed under state government command, these contingents largely failed to stop the violence, however, as Meitei groups, in particular, obstructed their movements by blocking – and even digging up – roads. Just as the Kuki do not trust the Meitei-dominated local police, [the Meitei allege](https://thewire.in/law/sedition-case-against-manipur-politician-who-blamed-assam-rifles) that the central forces, particularly a counter-insurgency force called the Assam Rifles, are biased toward the Kuki. Deployed in the state since the days of active insurgency, the Assam Rifles allegedly used Kuki militants after they signed the 2008 peace agreement to conduct operations against other militant groups, including Meitei outfits. Despite a history of protests by women in the region, the armed forces also found themselves unprepared to deal with the active participation of Meitei women in the conflict. On June 24, [the army released twelve captured Meitei militants](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-update-indian-army-itham-modi) (all men) who belonged to the banned Kanglei Yaol Kangla Lup outfit, from whom they had recovered numerous arms and stores of ammunition, after a standoff with a mob of an estimated 1,500 women. The women reportedly blocked all the roads in the area and refused to let the army carry on with the operation. The army said that considering the “[sensitivity of use of kinetic force](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/12-cadres-of-banned-manipur-extremist-group-released-after-mob-stops-army/article67006437.ece)” against a large crowd of women and the risk of casualties, the troops decided to hand over the militants and leave. The danger of a backlash from the Meiteis and the state government dominated by the community is the unspoken subtext. Apart from sending in the central security forces, the federal government has not been particularly proactive in dealing with the Manipur conflict; nor has it been very effective at dampening the unrest. At the end of May, following weeks of violence, Home Minister Amit Shah paid a three-day visit to Manipur, meeting both Meitei and Kuki delegations. ![](https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/01100536/Screenshot-2023-06-01-at-10.05.28-AM.png) Video screengrab showing Manipur CM N. Biren Singh with Union home minister Amit Shah in Manipur. Photo: Twitter/@NBirenSingh The Meitei groups pleaded with him not to accede to the Kukis’ demand for greater autonomy and to replace the Assam Rifles with another force. For their part, the Kuki delegation asked for imposition of president’s rule, a constitutional provision that allows New Delhi to suspend the state government and govern in its stead in case of emergency, and in the long term, for a separate Kuki administration. Shah appealed for calm, according to media reports, and promised to return two weeks later. [He has yet to come back](https://thewire.in/rights/amit-shah-manipur-promises-betrayed). On June 10, the federal government took what seemed to be an ameliorative measure, announcing the creation of a committee made up of the chief minister, elected representatives, political party leaders, and Meitei and Kuki representatives to start a peace dialogue. The initiative was an instant failure, however, as both [Meitei](https://thewire.in/rights/manipur-kuki-biren-singh-peace-committee) and [Kuki representatives refused to participate](https://thewire.in/rights/manipur-kuki-biren-singh-peace-committee) due to disagreements over the committee’s composition. Prompted by indignation over the video depicting the abuse of two naked Kuki women, Prime Minister Narendra Modi [spoke for the first time](https://thewire.in/politics/seventy-nine-days-after-violence-broke-out-narendra-modi-finally-talks-about-manipur) in public about the Manipur violence on 20 July. In a brief statement, he expressed shock at the video, assuring the public that justice would be served for the survivors of sexual violence. Whether this pledge translates into concrete action, however, remains to be seen. Also Read: [Narendra Modi Talked About the Manipur Violence. But Did He Really?](https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-talked-about-the-manipur-violence-but-did-he-really) National politics is also playing a part in the central state’s half-hearted response. Despite reports that Home Minister Shah is keeping a close watch on security conditions in the state, the absence of new concrete measures suggests that New Delhi has delegated the effort to control the violence to the state’s Meitei-dominated administration. Amid the turmoil, and given that state authorities like the BJP’s Biren Singh are widely perceived as partisan, the BJP-run federal government could have replaced the chief minister with someone less polarising. Alternatively, New Delhi could have opted to impose president’s rule, which would allow the central state to assume command over all security forces in the area and recover stolen weapons – a step that would have been in keeping with the tough security image cultivated by Modi’s federal government. Yet in the run-up to 2024 national elections, the BJP [appears reluctant to acknowledge its failures in Manipur](https://thewire.in/rights/video-ramachandra-guha-karan-thapar-narendra-modi-manipur) and to risk losing the Meiteis’ electoral support. **What can be done to put an end to the violence?** That Prime Minister Modi had kept mum on the crisis for almost three months, before the viral video forced him to break his silence, has generated anger on both sides. His statement, though criticised in some quarters for failing to address the broader outbreak of ethnic violence in Manipur, has encouraged Kuki women victims to share their testimonies with the media. The prime minister is popular in Manipur – both the Meitei and Kuki voted for the BJP in large numbers in two consecutive elections – and he could have made an immediate difference with an urgent personal appeal for peace. There is still an opportunity for such an intervention, though the BJP has so far appeared inclined to avoid deeper central state involvement in the crisis. ![](https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/27140126/Narendra-Modi-in-Manipur.jpeg) Narendra Modi campaigning in Imphal, Manipur’s capital city in 2014. Photo: Twitter/@PriyaaReturnz. Additionally, given the gravity of the situation, the central government should put political calculations aside and impose president’s rule in Manipur. This step would place all security forces automatically under New Delhi’s command and cause the state government to be dismissed, without abrogating citizens’ basic rights. In the past, this exceptional measure has usually been imposed in a conflict’s early stages, such as when deadly clashes broke out between the Nagas and Kukis in 1993. President’s rule has in fact been imposed ten times in the past in Manipur, most recently in 2001 when the state government lost its majority in the local legislature. Despite the delay, there is no better solution at this juncture given the urgent need for a neutral administration in Manipur to guarantee the peace and mediate between the parties. President’s rule would go a long way toward addressing Kuki distrust of the state government, but unless handled deftly could antagonise the Meitei. To placate the latter, Modi might well need to visit the region before imposing president’s rule for an initial six-month period, and make it clear to them (as well as the Kuki) that he will protect their interests. Measures to address the widespread sexual violence should be among the top priorities for the central government whether or not it decides to impose president’s rule. These should include sexual and reproductive health and psychosocial support for survivors, as well as efforts to bring perpetrators to justice. Progress in these areas will also contribute to strengthening trust between the citizenry and the state, feeding into longer-term peace and reconciliation objectives.

Two months after the unrest began, dead bodies are still lying unclaimed and unidentified in morgues because the Kuki are unable to travel to areas dominated by the Meitei and vice versa. The central security forces, in coordination with civil society organisations from both communities, could facilitate an exchange of bodies so that kin can proceed with proper funeral rites. This step could help build a modicum of confidence between the sides that would, ideally, allow for a comprehensive peace dialogue. Moreover, to avoid a failure like its first attempt in June at creating a peace committee, New Delhi should (when the moment arrives) consult widely among both communities before deciding on the composition of a dialogue panel. As much as possible, it should bring in moderates, including women, from both communities, preferably academics or civil society representatives who have not taken polarising stands during the violence. It should also make sure that members have no link to prominent politicians or militants on either side. Overthe long term, the central government should consider putting talks with Kuki militants who signed the Suspension of Operations Agreement back in 2008 on a fast track. Addressing Kuki aspirations for tribal autonomy will no doubt prove complex, as it will face stiff opposition from both the Meiteis and Nagas. But it is increasingly clear that whether the measures are immediate or for the longer term, New Delhi will need to overcome its reticence and take bolder steps to still Manipur’s ethnic turmoil. _This article has been republished here with permission from [the International Crisis Group](https://www.crisisgroup.org), where it [first appeared](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/india/ethnic-clashes-roiling-manipur-pose-test-indias-modi)._ Make a contribution to Independent Journalism[iframe](http://https:%2F%2Fm.thewire.in%2Farticle%2Fsecurity%2Fmanipur-violence-reasons-failure-and-solution-q-and-a%3Futm=authorpage) More in Politics : [Politics\\ \\ **‘To Effectively Fight Terror, Modi Must Treat All Indians Justly’: Arun Shourie**](https://thewire.in/politics/to-effectively-fight-terror-modi-must-treat-all-indians-justly-arun-shourie?mid_related_new) [View More ![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAwAAAAMCAYAAABWdVznAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAABNSURBVHgBzZHRCQAgCES9aO9qslZqA8voLy2/ooMDQZ+iEili5iTWcoF0YThbEBlTBOD3UBxBdbICzqXhcFsQrm3XiUX50+LTpwuADeh1HWDrK69YpwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://m.thewire.in/category/24919543/politics) [![Videos](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/428/adc10e02ec1073c23a6c2f476402de37268df25e.svg)Videos](https://m.thewire.in/category/24879887/video?UTM=Unify) [![Editor's Pick](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/428/4843988e79e6969e3e66bf6efd3d43e7fa1f18a4.svg)Editor's Pick](https://m.thewire.in/category/24879843/editor's-pick?UTM=Unify) [![Trending](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/428/7d9ce4b020481368d40c3f58b575b16c1a2cf4c3.svg)Trending](https://m.thewire.in/trendingnews?UTM=Unify) ![](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/117/a0619cf2a266f5388c0b213da8322a84311aca93.svg) [![](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/117/e498f092b841cfbb48a4be1fde83c3913890d435.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What's Behind the Manipur Violence and Why Stopping It Poses a Test For Modi&url=https://m.thewire.in/article/security/manipur-violence-reasons-failure-and-solution-q-and-a&via=thewire_in) ![](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/117/fcb0c6395d6b760d5eb074798897979491c7a4fa.svg) ![](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/117/40a1d42bd240081d2249478d93af97ee562d4dc6.svg) ![](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/post_images/website_260/new_post_images/5c41b962abf05_sharethis-logo.png) [![facebook](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/428/ca445d28abd945bde07af3aa9978f702398fedc3.png)](https://www.facebook.com/)[![twitter](https://mcmscache.epapr.in/mcms/428/3355570a8a0fa7e20ccde606e491f5a5f9569d29.png)](https://twitter.com/)",

[Sign up](https://subscribe.bylinetimes.com/newsletter-signup/) While the world focuses on the spectacle of India carrying out [its biggest national election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election) – with 960 million Indian citizens eligible to vote out of a population of 1.4 billion – serious unrest continues to haunt the state of Manipur. For the last five months, _Byline Times_ has continued to receive detailed weekly updates from frontline activists in the northeastern state. These catalogue ongoing communal violence between different ethnic and religious groups that is subverting social and political life in the remote region. Building on the conflict recounted in a [previous _Byline Times_ report](https://bylinetimes.com/2023/10/19/state-complicity-and-ethnic-cleansing-in-india/), this unrest has now been taking place for a year. The situation highlights a distinct disconnect between the apparent virtues of India as the world’s largest [democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) and the ongoing restriction of human rights in the country. December 2023 witnessed the suspension of [146 members of the Indian Parliament](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/why-141-india-opposition-mps-suspended-from-parliament) (100 from the Lower House and 46 from the Upper House). The suspensions were denounced as the [“murder of democracy”](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/murder-of-democracy-congress-after-14-opposition-mps-suspended-4673809) by the main opposition party – the Indian National Congress (INC) – and as a way to pass draconian [legislation](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/12/03/government-by-talking-shop-hardly-heres-just-some-of-the-major-reforms-keir-starmer-has-introduced-so-far/) across India. One of the excluded members, [Mahua Moitra](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67656686), who represents Manipur, has vocally criticised the ruling _Bharatiya Janata Party_’s (BJP) policies as generating a [“civil war”](https://www.dtnext.in/news/national/mahua-moitra-attacks-centre-says-situation-in-manipur-akin-to-civil-war-729174) in the state.

These non-Hindu tribal groups include the Kuki, Zomi, Mizo and Chin, which are more widely termed as the [Zo people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo_people). Activists maintain that, courtesy of their links to the ruling state [ministers](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/11/19/amid-the-media-noise-about-cronyism-keir-starmer-is-quietly-reforming-political-standards-for-the-better/) and sympathetic [police](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/11/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-child-abuse-allegations-made-by-victims-are-leading-to-charges/) groupings, the Meitei are being aided by official connivance in their carrying out of “ethnic pogroms”. Zo leaders note their [discrimination](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/09/police-race-action-plan-slammed/) by state officials and processes of “selective justice”, whereby Zo are presented as “anti-nationals” and are much more likely to be prosecuted. The [Supreme Court’s assertion that Manipur has witnessed a “total breakdown of law and order”](https://www.timesnownews.com/india/manipur-violence-case-supreme-court-summons-manipur-dgp-questions-lapses-article-102309550), even with 40,000 security personnel on the ground, compounds this favouritism. Such accusations come in the midst of continuing violence perpetrated by Meitei tribals and [well-armed militias, such as the Arambai Tenggol](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/explained-who-are-meitei-radical-group-arambai-tenggol-and-why-did-they-summon-manipur-lawmakers) and [Meitei Leepun](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/manipur-violence-it-is-a-global-war-says-meitei-leepun-leader-pramot-singh-interview/article67004485.ece).

Villages have also faced attacks by [Meitei militias using automatic weapons and mortars](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/violence-continues-in-manipur-mortars-and-automatic-weapons-used/article67253119.ece). Often these incidents have been photographed and filmed, before being shared on social [media](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/10/21/telegraph-misled-readers-on-climate-change-impact-rules-press-watchdog-in-rare-slap-down/) platforms to incite violence and intimidate targeted tribals. This unrest has been intensive and systematic over the last 12 months and by October 2023 more than 70,000 people (including 12,000 children) had been displaced. It has been heightened by [periodic internet bans](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/manipur-violence-internet-services-restored-border-areas-exception-meiteis-kukis-2471548-2023-12-04) and the use of fake news by Meitei media groups, as well as utilising large [protest](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/12/when-peaceful-protesters-face-harsher-sentences-than-violent-racists-something-has-to-give/) mobs to demand the removal of non-Meitei public officials.

It was alleged in December 2023 that the Meitei had used a drone to drop a looted mortar bomb on a village, and that the Manipur Government had provided drone training.

This process has included being labelled as refugees, illegal immigrants or [“narco-terrorists”](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/northeast/2023/jul/29/massive-rally-in-manipur-protestors-demand-nrc-action-against-chin-kuki-narco-terrorists-2599921.html), or having links with Myanmar or Bangladesh. Related to these phenomena is the continued religious persecution of the Christian-majority Zo by the Hindu-majority Meitei, which has included [the burning of 357 churches](https://www.opendoors.org.au/frontline-faith/understanding-manipur-what-led-to-the-recent-violence-against-christians-in-india/) since May. Evidence has also surfaced of Zo graves being desecrated. Such claims come despite the existence of regional [Meitei drug gangs](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-violence-poppy-national-security-golden-triangle) and the increased interception by Indian security forces of armed Meitei militia members infiltrating India across the Myanmar border. This discrimination has raised fears that the communal violence aims to force non-Meitei tribals from their land, in order [to monopolise oil, gas and mineral reserves](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/at-the-core-of-manipurs-ethnic-strife-is-fight-over-tribal-land-rights) (such as uranium and platinum). The normalization of violence and population displacement accentuates such a threat. State complicity also plays a role, with Meitei leaders having linkages to big mining corporations eager to exploit such valuable natural commodities. In some areas, power supplies to non-Meitei villages have been sabotaged, leaving them without power or telecommunications for days. Elsewhere, non-Meitei villages have been blockaded by militias, preventing the delivery of essential food and commodities. Signalling a further escalation, in January 2024, [the central Manipur government conceded security control of Imphal to the Arambai Tenggol](https://thediplomat.com/2024/01/abject-surrender-of-the-state-to-armed-militia-in-indias-manipur/). This gave the Meitei militia dominance over security arrangements in Manipur’s capital and – given the militia’s ongoing violence – is an ugly portent for the local non-Meitei population. Meitei legislators were reportedly forced to declare allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol. In the months since the Arambai Tenggol took over, Imphal has seen a rise in armed intimidation, extortion, the illegal occupation of property, and even the [use of improvised explosive devices](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/one-dead-one-injured-blast-indias-manipur-state-2024-02-24/), or IEDs.

Other groups are also recasting the anniversary of the day that Manipur joined the Indian Union on 21 September 1949 as now being a “Black Day” of protest. Additional groups have protested calling for an end to gender-based violence and violence against students. Further collectives are demanding the setting up of an independent Zo administration in Manipur. Coupled with these movements are increasing calls for the Zo areas of Manipur to merge with those in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, especially given the ongoing displacement of the Zo. Within this context, the response by the central government in New Delhi continues to be seen as lax and insufficient. Although the troubles in Manipur are receiving greater national coverage, [Prime Minister Narendra Modi has resisted calls to visit the region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/indian-opposition-walks-out-as-narendra-modi-refuses-to-discuss-manipur-conflict). This comes despite the severe economic and social damage being wrought upon its people, as well as the slow Meitei domination of Manipur’s state bureaucracies. The 2024 [general election](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/08/28/stark-figures-reveal-how-many-londoners-were-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-in-general-election/) may be a factor here, with the BJP seeking to hold the [Inner Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency) (that includes the regional capital Imphal) and possibly gain the [Outer Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency), which it lost to the Naga People’s Front by 73,782 votes in 2019. Moreover, such a blind eye can also potentially be explained by the BJP’s deeper aim to actively assimilate all India’s minorities towards its Hindu majoritarian outlook. Escalating Meitei-instigated violence against Manipur’s tribal groups certainly – and usefully – fits with such a dynamic and appears to be increasingly successful. It also strengthens narratives of India’s Hindu population being threatened by non-Hindus. A BJP victory in the 2024 national [elections](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) will only hasten such a forced “harmonisation”, with negative consequences for other non-Hindu groups, regions, and states across India. * * * ##### Written by [Chris Ogden](https://bylinetimes.com/author/chrisogden/) * * * ##### This article was filed under [Christianity](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/christianity/), [Democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/category/democracy/), [Hinduism](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/hinduism/), [India](https://bylinetimes.com/category/foreign-affairs/india-foreign-affairs/)",

Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade. But that may start to change. As China forges deeper ties with India's nuclear archrival, Pakistan, and as each...",

This was the Bay of Bengal’s first tropical cyclone of the year and, according to news reports, it was so severe that flood protection embankments washed away, and millions were left without power after the network infrastructure experienced severe damage. As result of the storm’s 135kmph (84mph) winds, Kolkata airport closed, shipping was halted at Chittagong seaport, and schools closed as evacuees moved to over 9,000 cyclone shelters with assistance from India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Cyclones in Indian coastal zones are not a new phenomenon, but they have increased in number and magnitude in recent years [\\[1\\]](https://www.thebci.org/news/the-rising-storm-of-climate-risks-in-india.html#citation1), creating concerns for resilience professionals over escalating climate risks to the country. Vaidyanathan Chandramouli, India’s [BCI Chennai Chapter](https://www.thebci.org/group/india-chennai.html) Leader, said: > _“Climate risk is indeed a significant concern in India. Recent observations have shown irregularities in monsoon patterns, with some regions experiencing reduced rainfall with others facing excessive downpours. This inconsistency is marked by periods of heavy rain followed by abrupt stops, disrupting the usual monsoon cycle. Additionally, there is a noticeable rise in maximum temperatures across the country. Traditionally cooler regions are warming, and winters are becoming more severe”._ He adds: > _“The primary concern posed by climate-related events in our region is the threat to supply chains and loss of premises. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events can disrupt operations, damage infrastructure, and create significant logistical challenges. Additionally, the warming of cooler regions leads to increased use of air conditioning, which contributes to global warming, while the intensification of winters necessitates heating equipment, creating a vicious cycle in the long run.”_ Vaidyanathan reported that business continuity and resilience practitioners in India are exploring how to diversify and decentralise operations to better manage risks and adapt infrastructure to withstand extreme weather. Another avenue is exploring enhanced early warning systems to support timely evacuation and asset protection. However, support from top management is crucial in addressing these concerns effectively, as it is only with adequate support that organizations can implement the necessary measures to build climate resilience and ensure long-term preparedness. This is a change from traditional business continuity management that deals with the effects of disruption in order get back on track with critical activities into a more proactive approach of strategic thinking that modifies organizational structures and adapts infrastructure in advance. However, Vaidyanathan added: > “Currently, there is limited understanding of these concerns, especially in countries like India, where small and medium enterprises (SMEs) significantly contribute to the economy. Their primary focus tends to be business sustainability rather than climate sustainability.” The [BCI Climate Risk Report 2023](https://www.thebci.org/news/new-report-shows-climate-risk-priorities-for-bc-and-resilience-professionals.html) underlines Vaidyanathan’s response. Survey respondents from around the world said that threats related to climate-related events are on the rise. Indeed, 44.4% of respondents stated they had seen a moderate or significant impact from climate related events over the past five years with rainfall and flooding topping the list as their primary climate-related concern. Extreme heat/heatwaves, hurricanes and tornadoes, and wildfires also posed risks, as did the new and rising concern of water scarcity. As a result of increasing climate threats, 47% of respondents highlighted supply chain interruption as their primary concern. Staff absenteeism, loss of premises and power, and revenue dips are also significant potential threats. However, despite these wide-ranging outcomes and the notable rise in events, 22.1% of respondents report their organization has yet to consider climate risk on their risk agenda. To face the rising tide of climate threats, practitioners should seek to align business continuity plans to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) propositions and ensure provision of adequate back-up systems for power and communications. As demonstrated by Cyclone Remal, climate-related events are increasing in ferocity and frequency, and, without any associated legislative regulations to enforce organizational action, ensuring climate risk remains a topic on top management agendas is key to embedding genuine commitment to mitigate climate risk, as well as ensuring a proactive approach is taken. * * * ### Citations \\[1\\][https://climatefactchecks.org/climate-change-leading-to-rise-in-intensity-of-cyclones-along-indias-coastline/](https://climatefactchecks.org/climate-change-leading-to-rise-in-intensity-of-cyclones-along-indias-coastline/) ###### More on -

USAID @ The Asia Foundation LS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Improving Lives, Expanding Opportunities INDIA-U.S. TRIANGULAR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 01 The Asia Foundation, 2022, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey - Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. The Asia Foundation: New Delhi Disclaimer This report is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the ‘India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) at The Asia Foundation. The opinions expressed here are solely of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government and The Asia Foundation. 02 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Foreword India and the U.S. share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. India’s long\u0002standing engagement in the region makes it a strong development partner and leader. The Asia Foundation through its India- U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a program funded by USAID, is working toward realizing this vision and strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s development cooperation footprint in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The program builds on the U.S. government’s commitment to strengthen triangular partnership programs with India in the Indo-Pacific region and is informed by the U.S. government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and its Pacific Islands Strategy. TriDeP seeks to support the Government of India’s development assistance in the Indo\u0002Pacific region by identifying countries keen to expand their development partnership with India in sectors defined by their country needs, and by supporting programming based on such identification. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Smart Agriculture and Renewable Energy are sectors where India demonstrates policy leadership and technical skills, and thus can provide sustainable solutions. This report presents a diagnostic study that maps India’s capabilities in disaster management, as well as identifying opportunities for India and the developing countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South Asia to partner for promising solutions. Over the years, India’s disaster management approach has evolved rapidly to respond to the slew of challenges posed by a range of disasters. India’s diverse geo-climatic conditions make it vulnerable to multiple natural and human\u0002caused disasters, thus prompting the country to develop tailored policies and frameworks for coordinated multi-stakeholder disaster-risk reduction efforts. TriDeP seeks to leverage India’s know-how in disaster management, by sharing technical expertise and knowledge and supporting local adaptation, to improve resilience and preparedness against disasters in the Indo\u0002Pacific region. TriDeP aims to do this in close collaboration with a range of stakeholders, including governments, communities, and the private sector, through cost-effective and context-specific solutions. This diagnostic identifies India’s expertise in establishing well-defined institutional systems; legislative, policy and planning frameworks; robust search and rescue capabilities; improved early warning systems; technological advancements for disaster risk management; improved emergency communication; expanded disaster resource and knowledge networks; emergency operations centers; enhanced response capabilities and systems; and post-disaster mental health management. The study also identifies opportunities for India-U.S. triangular cooperation across several countries in the Indo-Pacific region. While the diagnostic study was underway, the Covid-19 virus struck with severity unimagined in a century and has brought to the fore the disastrous dimensions of pandemics, including psychological and physical health challenges that require concerted medical responses to India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 03 address them. Several participants in a virtual meeting of experts from the Indo-Pacific region to discuss the study expressed interest in the knowledge and expertise of India in psychosocial care and telemedicine health services, both important focus areas that help to address pandemic-related health issues. I would like to thank Balaji Singh Chowhan, who is the lead author and researcher for this report and an expert in disaster managenment. I would like to thank Veena Reddy, USAID/ India and Bhutan Mission Director; Karen Klimowski, Deputy Mission Director; John Smith-Sreen, Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; MaryTyler E. Holmes, Deputy Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; Sukanya Banerjee, Development Partnership Adviser and the Activity Manager for TriDeP; and Arun Sahdeo, Project Management Specialist (Disaster Risk Management) for their support to the program and their valuable inputs and suggestions that enhanced the quality of the report. Our thanks to all the technical experts from the disaster management sector in India, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Island countries for their participation in the research, valuable insights, and contributions to the study. At The Asia Foundation, we would like to thank Anthea Mulakala, Senior Director for International Cooperation for her guidance during the study. Atul Kaushik, TriDeP Chief of Party, led the planning and execution of the diagnostic, ably assisted by Malavika Thirukode, Program Officer. Ramesh Navaladi, Deputy Chief of Party and Ajay Singh, Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning and Adaptation Specialist, each made valuable contributions to the report’s approach and content. Aparna Achuthan, Program Officer, made valuable contributions to finalizing the report, and Suzan Nolan from BlueSky International contributed to the editing of the report. I hope the findings from this report will pave the way for strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s approach to triangular partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region.

Sen Pilgrims being rescued from Badrinath after the 2021 Uttarakhand flood. 10 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey I ndia, due to its unique geo-climatic conditions, is vulnerable to multiple natural and human-caused disasters, such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, hailstorms, cold waves, heat waves, glacier lake outburst floods, wildfires, oil spills, and other major pollution events. The country’s journey toward holistic and modern disaster risk reduction (DRR) practices began more than 20 years ago, when several natural disasters resulted in thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses. These disasters spurred India toward a more comprehensive DRR approach, eventually leading the country to tremendous disaster management progress: Subsequent disasters have resulted in minimized deaths and losses because of India’s effective DRR efforts. Over the course of the past two decades, India’s disaster management approach evolved from a reactive, search-and-rescue, and relief-centered approach primarily centered on flood and drought to a proactive, holistic approach that includes prevention, mitigation, preparedness, capacity building, risk reduction, technological investment and advancements, community involvement, and risk resilience for a far wider range of hazards. Holistic disaster management requires mainstreaming DRR into policies, institutions, infrastructure, and logistics in order to develop tools for effective and efficient action. India developed DRR policies for multiple stakeholders by integrating inputs from domain experts and all levels of governments and communities; it also increased response effectiveness through international coalitions, and coordinated risk reduction capabilities at the national and local levels. India’s holistic DRR efforts involve robust legal frameworks; effective policy design and development; domestic policy and institutional coherence; a focus on capacity building, expert input, and knowledge sharing; well-oiled administrative mechanisms; an ability to prevent or mitigate disasters before they occur, as well as effective and inclusive rescue and recovery operations. India’s disaster management learning curve owes a great deal to how India adapted crucial disaster management elements from other countries to India’s own context. Now, other countries have the opportunity to emulate India’s DRR journey in order to accelerate their own efforts, thereby saving thousands of lives and millions in economic losses. India has multiple bilateral and multilateral DRR relationships with other countries, such as the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, the European Commission, and United Nations agencies. Given this international cooperation framework already in place and India’s extensive DRR capabilities, it would be hugely beneficial for India to branch out to additional triangular cooperation (TrC) initiatives, especially partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which already has a strong DRR backbone with India. These TrC initiatives would be led by India as the primary source of expertise and technical assistance and could also benefit from the involvement of several United States agencies and private-sector or nongovernmental organizations. India’s South-South development cooperation model would thus be considerably enhanced, with the triangulation of efforts between India and the United States increasing India’s development assistance footprint in the developing countries of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. This report begins with an explanation of India’s 20-year journey from search and rescue\u0002related crisis management to prevention, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 11 mitigation, and preparedness, setting the groundwork for how India’s experiences can be adapted to other countries’ own disaster management contexts. The second chapter details the interplay between India’s DRR strategy, legislation, policy interventions, disaster management administration and institutions, and its perspectives on gender equity and social inclusion in DRR efforts. Chapter three breaks down how India can share its knowledge and DRR capabilities through the country’s multiple DRR technologies and capacity-building institutions, including centers of excellence for training in general disaster management and early warning systems; specialized institutions for search and rescue and disaster assessment, mitigation, and planning; private- and nongovernmental organization\u0002run training institutes; Incident Command System adaptations; risk communication and language adaptations; and equipment stocks and suppliers. The fourth chapter outlines the DRR status of three Indo-Pacific sub-regions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indo-Pacific Islands, and briefly discusses the potential DRR needs of ideal TrC partners. Chapter five concludes with a discussion about the viability of TrC initiatives, and makes recommendations for suitable TrC activities in 10 Indo-Pacific countries. About the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) India, The Asia Foundation is implementing the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a three-year program in support of the United States’ and India’s mutual aims in the Indo\u0002Pacific Region. In a ground-breaking initiative to catalyze North-South-South triangular cooperation (TrC) throughout an entire region – the Indo-Pacific – rather than with a single country, the TriDeP program will facilitate partnerships between India, the United States, and several South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Indo-Pacific Island countries.1 The TriDeP program has identified three priority areas where India can share its proven expertise: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate-smart agriculture, and renewable energy. The TriDeP program team selected DRR for its inaugural research initiative to explore how and where India’s demonstrated DRR policy leadership, practical experience, and sustainable results can be shared with countries in the region. After assessing India’s DRR capacities and capabilities and matching them to the needs and capabilities of potential Indo-Pacific partner countries, the TriDeP program will develop demand-driven, context-specific TrC projects that combine Indian experience and Photographer: Saikiran Kesari Stranded citizens making their way through the flooded streets of Mumbai, India during the 2020 Mumbai floods. 12 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey expertise with Indian and American technical assistance, drawing on India’s centers of excellence, training institutions, relevant private sector entities, and nongovernmental and civil society organizations. Research Objectives The TriDeP program team undertook action research on India’s DRR institutions and capabilities in order to understand the Indian\u0002Indo-Pacific DRR landscape, identify DRR needs in potential beneficiary countries, highlight areas of India’s DRR expertise that could be shared, suggest priority partners and projects for initial TrC implementations, and determine suitable activities to support project design and implementation. Research Methodology The action research for this report took place from January through June 2021. The research process began with a thorough review of the literature followed by nine telephone and seven in-person interviews with 16 Indian government representatives, technical specialists, and practitioners experienced in DRR and disaster management in order to gain a preliminary overview of India’s current capabilities – what we will call the “supply-side” of DRR (see Annexure 1 for participant list). The study also involved extensive desk research to gather background information about India’s supply-side capabilities. The supply-side research also involved convening a group of 17 experts from India, including independent DRR experts, leaders of DRR civil society organizations (CSOs) working in India, and current and retired government functionaries who lead or have led India’s disaster responses. These experts were joined by six supporting Photographer: Dr. Ashok K A Doppler Radar meteorological geodesic dome atop a hillock at Vishakhapatnam, India. India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 13 staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 2 for participant list). The supply-side research was complemented by what we will call “demand-side” desk research about Indo-Pacific countries’ geographies and their disaster exposures, histories, institutional and technical capabilities, current disaster\u0002aid partnerships, and relevant socioeconomic profiles. The desk research was enhanced through discussions with a group of 39 experts in the fields of DRR and climate change impacts; these experts represented countries, states, or organizations from Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Germany, India, Nepal, United Kingdom, United Nations, United States, and international nongovernmental and civil society organizations. These experts were joined by seven supporting staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 3 for participant list). The demand-side experts discussed DRR needs as perceived by countries in the region, identified geopolitical interests or sensitivities, and postulated supply-demand matches. Since Covid-19 pandemic restrictions prevented in-person meetings, both supply- and demand-side convenings took place online and lasted about two hours each. During the demand-side convening, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted requests from some Indo-Pacific countries for assistance with health- and psychosocial-care needs to combat and counter the effects of the pandemic. Although the TriDeP team did not focus on pandemic disasters in the initial research phases, this report describes some of India’s supply-side telemedicine and psychosocial-care capabilities that could match demand-side requests for pandemic- and other health-related cooperation projects. Drawing on the desk research, interviews, and discussions with the TriDeP program team, and his own extensive experience in the field and personal familiarity with the actors, the author identifies 10 countries as potential TrC candidates and indicates their potential needs for equipment, services, and technical assistance that would increase the effectiveness of disaster risk management and response. In his selection of potential match countries, the author also considered complementary and competing DRR programs and activities already in progress with other providers. The author cautions, of course, that all DRR assistance proposals should align with host government priorities and that all recommended disaster management solutions must be fine-tuned and based on further contextual analyses. Pertinent facts about the 10 potential match countries and possible TrC initiatives are detailed in Annexure 4, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Maldives, the Philippines, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. In addition, the author presents disaster risk profiles for 16 other Indo-Pacific Region countries that may become candidates for TrC in the future: Brunei, Cook Islands, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Vanuatu (Annexure 5). The author’s TrC recommendations are consistent with the Intermediate Result (IR) 3.1 of the USAID India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS).2 The Asia Foundation is a non-profit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, its work across the region addresses five overarching goals – strengthen governance, empower women, expand economic opportunity, increase environmental resilience, and promote international cooperation. The TriDeP creates an opportunity for The Asia Foundation to examine emerging cross-cutting critical issues, such as disaster risk reduction, that warrant deeper investigation to inform its program strategies to ensure the Foundation remains at the leading edge of changing dynamics in the regional context – geopolitical, environmental, and legal/regulatory – and well-positioned to tackle the most critical issues facing Asia.

To be effective, all these elements must come together as a seamless whole. The policies, institutions, and logistics of disaster management are as important as the actual equipment used to rescue people – absolutely vital in handling disasters, in reaching to the last mile, and in determining the tools for effective and efficient action. Equally important is the involvement of disaster management practitioners in policy design and development – the domain and subject matter experts who understand the complexity and who know how to make disaster management policies, institutions, and logistics work together most effectively. Effective disaster management usually requires a long phase of development; time is the main challenge in setting up vital elements. Experts see India’s present disaster management approach as a journey that lasted just over two decades. It began at the time of super Cyclone Photographer: Fernando Quevedo de Oliveira Forest fires above Thak village in Uttarakhand, India in May, 2016. 16 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey ‘The Government of India and other stakeholders implemented recommenda- tions from a High Powered Committee (HPC). ‘The HPC’s report guided India’s disaster managernent approach from a relief-centric approach to one that embrac- es prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. fo strengthen India’s approach, the HPC. also made other recommendations: linking development efforts to disaster reduction; estab- lishing a disaster knowledge network, promoting interna- tional cooperation; applying a national disaster mitigation strat adopting a commu- nity-based approach; and fostering a culture of preven- tive thinking, The enactment of the National Disast ment Act and the de lop- ment of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and state- and district-level disaster n ‘ nt authorities (SDMAs and DDMAs) set the stage for India’s National Institute m of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 17 The National Policy on Disaster Management (2009) motivated community-based disaster management, last-mile integration of policy and plans, executional capacity development, consolidation of past initia- tives, deployment of best prs agencies at national and tices, cooperation with international levels, and multi-sectoral synergies. First announced in Novem- ber 2016 during the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Prime Minister's Ten Point Agenda restated DRR priorities, such as bolstering local capacities, enhancing, knowledge networks, and supporting international coalitions. The 2016 National Disaster Management Plan, subse- quently updated in 2019, provided a [ramework for disaster management plans at the ministerial, depart mental, state, and district levels. The Plan set out mechanisms for multiagency coordina- tion: the National Executive Committee (NEC), headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary at the national level, and the State Executive headed by a Chief Secretary mmiittee, at the state-government level.",

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others.

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

These include political rallies, electoral campaign events, religious processions, protest marches, demonstrations, and cultural or nationalist gatherings. In other instances, they are organized with the express objective of harassing minorities. In 2024, the Indian general election, state elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, and hate rallies triggered by exaggerated claims of violence against Hindus in Bangladesh served as key catalysts for a significant proportion of hate speech incidents. Hate speech in India in 2024 followed an alarming trajectory, deeply intertwined with the ideological ambitions of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the broader Hindu nationalist movement. The number of hate speech incidents targeting religious minorities surged from 668 in 2023 to 1,165 in 2024, marking a staggering 74.4% increase. Dangerous speech—defined as speech that \"increases the risk that its audience will condone or participate in violence against members of another group\"—also saw a significant rise. Patterns of hate speech in 2024 reflect both continuity and transformation in its context and content with longstanding Hindu nationalist tropes remaining dominant—such as the portrayal of Muslims and Christians as “outsiders” in Hindu India and Muslims as a threat to Hindus. Hate speeches frequently invoked the narrative of Muslims as \"infiltrators,\" linked to thinly veiled allegations of all Indian Muslims as Bangladeshi migrants or Rohingya refugees. Hindu far-right leaders demonized Indian Muslims as parasitic and thieving, alleging that they were either wrongfully granted resources that rightfully belonged to Hindus or were stealing Hindu wealth through acts of aggression. These rhetorical shifts reinforced exclusionary narratives, further escalating anti-minority sentiment and hostility. Social media platforms—Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter)—have been key instruments in enabling, amplifying, and mainstreaming hate speech and extremist ideologies, both in India and globally. In the Indian context, these platforms have been extensively utilized to articulate and spread Hindu nationalist ideology and anti-minority rhetoric. Of the 1,165 in-person hate speech events targeting Muslim and Christian minorities in 2024, 995 videos were traced back to their original sources on social media, where they were first uploaded or live streamed. Given the logic of virality, social media platforms facilitate the rapid and widespread circulation of hateful content while also elevating the most extreme instances of hate speech through algorithmic amplification. Despite their own community standards prohibiting hate speech, social media platforms failed to enforce their guidelines, allowing violative content to spread unchecked. Viewed cumulatively, shifts in hate speech patterns in 2024 reinforced and amplified the core tenets of the Hindu nationalist worldview, that is, the idea of India as an exclusively Hindu nation with minorities, especially Muslims and Christians, as perpetual outsiders. The sharp spike in the rise of hate speech events points to the incorporation of hate speech as part of routine electoral politics and campaign strategy. It is also indicative of an increasingly aggressive assertion of Hindu nationalism in public and political life. As of 2024, Hindu nationalism has taken on a much more extreme form, with its rhetoric becoming more blatant, inflammatory, and violent. Marking a continuity with past trends, hate speech in 2024 contributed to an environment where increasingly egregious expressions of hate and violence against Indian minorities continued to be normalized. **Keywords:** India, Hate Speech, Hindu nationalism, India Hate Lab, Center for the Study of Organized Hate, Narendra Modi, T Raja Singh, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Indian Muslims, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party, Nitesh Rane **Suggested Citation:** [Suggested Citation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5130832) Lab, India Hate, **Report 2024: Hate Speech Events in India** (February 10, 2025).

Image: Tata Power. The build-out of India’s power transmission network is lagging behind the country’s rapid growth in renewable energy, leading to project delays and cost increases. That is the conclusion of a report out today from think-tank IEEFA South Asia and market analysts JMK Research, which reveals that over 50GW of renewable energy capacity was stranded across India as of June this year due to transmission constraints. ## Try Premium for just $1 - Full premium access for the first month at only $1 - Converts to an annual rate after 30 days unless cancelled - Cancel anytime during the trial period [Start $1 Trial](https://www.pv-tech.org/invite/L579GzIZSq1k4q2HHP) ### Premium Benefits - Expert industry analysis and interviews - Digital access to PV Tech Power journal - Exclusive event discounts ### Or get the full Premium subscription right away [Get Premium Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/www.pv-tech.org) ### Or continue reading this article for free [Get Basic (FREE) Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/www.pv-tech.org) The report said these constraints are limiting the pace at which new capacity can be brought online and undermining India’s ability to reach its clean energy targets. According to the report, the most recent network expansion figures reveal a 42% gap between planned and commissioned transmission lines, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade. Annual transmission line additions have fallen short of planned levels since 2019, with only 2021 surpassing expectations, the report noted. “In several high-demand corridors, speculative hoarding of transmission capacity by entities without genuine project intent has driven up connectivity prices and delayed access for viable projects,” said the report’s contributing author, Vibhuti Garg, IEEFA’s South Asia director. “Right-of-way issues, extended land acquisition timelines, restrictions on equipment procurement, and multi-agency approvals also contribute to delays,” added Prabhakar Sharma, co-author of the report and a senior consultant at JMK Research. The report highlighted the mismatch between variable generation and grid consumption as part of the problem. While solar generation aligns with the afternoon peak consumption pattern, it tapers off in the evening when demand is high, creating a gap that limits the integration of renewables and leads to the underutilisation of transmission corridors. Energy storage is vital to bridge this gap, the report said. It singled out the state of Rajasthan, where 8GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded, with nearly half of that curtailed during peak solar hours. Delayed completion of the Associated Transmission System, the dedicated transmission infrastructure linked to new generation projects, along with capacity hoarding and ecological directives, has compounded evacuation challenges, inflated project costs and reduced operational efficiency. IEEFA and JMK said a unified generation-transmission planning framework that aligns timelines and locations for new generation and transmission capacity was a key part of the solution. This would involve a coordinated approach, combining regulatory reform, operational efficiency measures and capital mobilisation. The integration of energy storage systems should also be prioritised in renewable-rich regions to enhance capacity utilisation and reduce curtailment, the report added. Specific measures identified in the report include a single-window clearance system to streamline land, right of way and connectivity approvals, and performance-based incentives and disincentives tied to asset utilisation metrics to encourage timely commissioning and sustained operations. “Without targeted reforms, misalignment between generation commissioning and evacuation infrastructure is likely to continue driving congestion, curtailment, and systemic inefficiencies, ultimately slowing progress towards achieving India’s decarbonisation objectives,” the report concluded.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) After many years of infrastructure development and gradual encroachment, China is accelerating efforts to secure its military presence and access to water rights along the Indian border near Ladakh. But while it appears Beijing has largely achieved this objective for now, the harsh Himalayan winter could again escalate its standoff with India by challenging China's ability to maintain a presence throughout the disputed territory....

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(VYACHESLAV OSELEDKO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Central Asia has restructured its economic links over the past decade, as China has outpaced Russia in the region on trade, investment and infrastructure development._ - _Russia maintains its influence in Central Asia, however, and China so far has been careful to make sure its economic initiatives in the region largely complement Moscow's interests._ - _While China and Russia have worked to mitigate potential differences in Central Asia, several factors potentially could cause problems between Moscow and Beijing in the years to come._ Central Asia has undergone a significant economic transformation in recent years as trade and investment in the region have shifted away from Russia and toward China. Russia remains a major economic force in Central Asia, and China's rise in the region complements its interests in many ways -- or at least doesn't directly contradict them. But Central Asia's growing economic dependence on China and Beijing's increasing political and security influence in the region could foster increased tensions between the two powers....

Tewani [Download Full Report](https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/Green%20Power%20Transmission%20Development%20in%20India%20FV6%20%281%29.pdf) [View Press Release](https://ieefa.org/articles/transmission-expansion-trails-renewable-energy-growth-india) ## Key Findings Over 50GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded nationwide as of June 2025, leading to project delays and increasing per-unit transmission costs. These constraints limit the pace at which new capacity can be brought online. India’s transition to renewables is limited by the mismatch between variable generation and grid consumption. While solar generation aligns with the afternoon peak consumption pattern, it tapers off in the evening when demand is high. This creates a gap that limits renewable integration and leads to the underutilisation of transmission corridors. Energy storage is vital to bridge this gap. Renewable corridors often operate below their intended capacity; however, some degree of underutilisation is temporary, as it reflects strategic overbuilding to meet future demand growth. Transmission planning needs to move beyond the traditional five-year static cycle to a more adaptive approach that reflects evolving generation patterns and demand growth. India’s power transmission network, one of the largest in the world, spans over 494,000 circuit kilometres (ckm) of lines and 1.33 million megavolt-amperes of transformation capacity, forming a fully synchronised national grid. However, the network struggles to keep up with renewable energy deployment, leading to a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of evacuation infrastructure. This imbalance limits renewable integration and increases the risk of stranded assets and higher delivery costs. The widening gap between planned and actual transmission network expansion is becoming evident. In FY2025, only 8,830ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253ckm, reflecting a 42% shortfall, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade. Alongside this capacity gap, system inefficiencies are emerging, with analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicating that up to 71% of ISTS corridors operate below 30% utilisation, underscoring the mismatch between infrastructure availability and actual power flows. Market distortions further aggravate the situation. In several high-demand corridors, speculative hoarding of transmission capacity by entities without genuine project intent has driven up connectivity prices and delayed access for viable projects. Structural and procedural bottlenecks, including right-of-way (RoW) disputes, prolonged land acquisition processes, restrictions on equipment procurement, and multi-agency approval requirements, add to the delay. Among these, RoW remains one of the most significant barriers to timely transmission development. Similar land acquisition hurdles in the US have also slowed new transmission build-outs. In India, the impact is most visible in Rajasthan, where 8 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity remains stranded, with nearly half curtailed during peak solar hours. Delayed completion of the Associated Transmission System—the dedicated transmission infrastructure linked to new generation projects—along with capacity hoarding and ecological directives mandating underground cabling in Great Indian Bustard habitats, have compounded evacuation challenges, inflated project costs, and reduced operational efficiency. The implications are significant—over 50GW of renewable energy capacity is currently stranded nationwide, increasing per-unit transmission costs, weakening project viability, and deterring private investment. These constraints limit the pace at which new capacity can be brought online and undermine India’s ability to integrate variable renewable energy at scale, risking missed milestones in the country’s clean energy transition. A unified generation-transmission planning framework that aligns timelines and locations for both generation and transmission capacity additions is essential. A single-window clearance system with strict timelines should be implemented to streamline land, RoW, and connectivity approvals. Performance-based incentives and disincentives tied to asset utilisation metrics can encourage timely commissioning and sustained operations. Scaling asset monetisation and public-private partnerships will be essential to unlocking capital for both inter-state and intra-state projects. In parallel, reconductoring of congested corridors and integration of energy storage systems should be prioritised in renewable-rich regions to enhance capacity utilisation and reduce curtailment. A coordinated approach—combining regulatory reform, operational efficiency measures, and capital mobilisation—will be critical to transforming India’s transmission network into a flexible, resilient system capable of supporting high renewable penetration while ensuring cost-effective and reliable power delivery. The recent extension of ISTS charge waivers for storage and the implementation of time block-based General Network Access allocation—which allows power generators to use the transmission network without pre-identifying buyers—are steps in the right direction. Without targeted reforms, misalignment between generation commissioning and evacuation infrastructure is likely to continue driving congestion, curtailment, and systemic inefficiencies, ultimately slowing progress towards achieving India’s decarbonisation objectives. ### Vibhuti Garg Vibhuti Garg is the Director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), where she leads efforts to advance sustainable development through strategic policy interventions in energy pricing, subsidy reforms, innovative business models, and market design.

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...

(NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....
