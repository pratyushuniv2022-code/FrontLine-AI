Of these, the threat posed by Naxalism, a Maoist insurrection active in the eastern half of the country for over four decades, is the most overlooked and analytically neglected in Western academic and security circles. In the past seven years, Naxalite activity has grown in scope, breadth, and violence, in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu, and killed or displaced tens of thousands of people. By 2006, the problem was so severe that India’s Prime Minister characterized the insurgency as the greatest internal security threat ever faced by his country. Given India’s bloody history with separatist and communal violence, such a pronouncement is truly startling. This thesis undertakes an historical analysis of the Naxalite movement to assess how great a danger its current iteration truly poses, and what the implications might be for India’s continued rise. Soberingly, it finds that the insurgency is indeed stronger and more dangerous today than at any time in the past. Furthermore, while it does not pose an existential threat to the state in the same way as its counterpart in Nepal, it will prove extremely disruptive to India’s further growth and development if not swiftly and effectively countered. New Delhi’s efforts in this regard are so far unimpressive, but it is not too late to act. The United States has a vested interest in the emergence of a strong and stable India, and may be able to help its new “strategic partner” address the challenge of Naxalism’s resurgence.

PURPOSE “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”1 With this startling pronouncement in April 2006, India’s Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, finally drew the West’s attention to an insurgency that had plagued his country for more than four decades, taking nearly 20,000 lives in the process.2 While the world was fixated on the violence in Kashmir, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and intermittent bouts of Hindu\u0002Muslim sectarian violence, an archaic Maoist ideology, rejected even in the land of its birth, was growing in scope, breadth, and violence. Over the past seven years in particular, Naxalite rebels have come to control large swathes of the Indian countryside in a “Red Corridor” stretching from Nepal to Tamil Nadu and killed thousands of Indian security forces and civilians. This thesis will examine the evolution of the Naxalite threat, from its humble beginnings in 1967 to the present, to ascertain the true danger posed to India’s rise as a twenty-first century Asian power. B. IMPORTANCE Since the end of the Cold War and economic reforms in the early 1990s, India’s performance has been truly staggering. It would be difficult to overstate the key role the country is expected to assume in the global community over the coming decades. With a population of over 1.2 billion, a young, growing, and increasingly educated workforce, and persistent real GDP growth rates in the area of 8 percent over the last decade, India is emerging as a powerful driver of the world economy.3 Its demographic clout and 1 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” (speech, New Delhi, India, April 13, 2006), Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128 (accessed August 10, 2007). 2 Jane’s Information Group, “India’s Mosaic of Conflict,” Jane’s Terrorism and Security Monitor, July 14, 2004, http://www8.janes.com/ (accessed August 7, 2007). 3 Ibid. 2 political ambitions are also thrusting it increasingly into positions of international leadership, as the debate on its accession to permanent membership on the UN Security Council attests. If the twenty-first century is truly to be the “Asian Century,” India, along with China, will likely be leading the way. Since the late 1990s, India has also emerged as an increasingly important strategic partner to the United States. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, India was one of the first countries in Asia to extend its support in the Global War on Terror, offering refueling rights to U.S. ships and aircraft on their way toward Afghanistan. The strategic partnership has grown since then, most famously with the 10-year defense accord signed in 2005 and the U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement of 2006.4 The United States has been assiduously cultivating a closer relationship with New Delhi, and greater military and strategic ties between the two countries are clearly important components of future U.S. foreign policy in Asia. However, India’s effectiveness as a world leader and U.S. strategic partner is contingent upon its continued internal stability and economic development. If Naxalism is as great a threat as many believe, its continuing spread will have serious negative repercussions on both fronts, to the detriment of India, the United States, and the larger world. A comprehensive examination and analysis of the phenomenon, and its potential to derail India’s development, is therefore both timely and important. C. LITERATURE REVIEW The Naxalist movement emerged in 1967 as an uprising of disaffected and disenfranchised peasants in Naxalbari, West Bengal. Given its four decade long existence, there is generally a surprising dearth of academic study on the movement. Western scholarship on insurgency in South Asia usually focuses on the conflict in Kashmir and (perhaps surprisingly) the plethora of smaller insurrections in India’s 4 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, External Affairs,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 26, 2007, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 3 Northeast.5 What little attention is paid to Naxalism is focused almost solely on the underlying causes of insurgent movements in general, treating Naxalism simply as one case in a larger group. Nevertheless, these treatments do provide valuable insight on contributing factors to the movement’s rise and persistence. There seem to be two main schools of thought on this issue. The first is that insurgencies arise out of unmet political demands, usually from a minority that feels it is being oppressed.6 The second school of thought cites economic inequality as a reason for insurgent uprising, typified by the revolts of lower class social groups against what they feel is lack of access to economic gain.7 A third, smaller body of literature stresses the importance of contributing factors, asserting that uprisings are more likely to occur where the terrain provides sanctuary to small groups that can train, equip, and educate their followers outside the reach of government forces.8 In the case of Naxalism, elements of all three theories seem to be at play, and are echoed in the literature from outside the West. Unsurprisingly, the study of the Naxalite movement is more extensive in India itself. Here, however, the problem seems to be not so much a lack of analysis, but the questionable objectivity, quality, and relevance of much of the scholarship. A few works on the early phases of Naxalite activity are extant, but many of these are biased to varying degrees, written by the movement’s sympathizers or even the Maoist revolutionaries themselves.9 Of somewhat greater objectivity are a handful of histories authored by journalists, but their scope, too, is limited to the earliest years of Naxalite 5 Lawrence E.

With respect to more recent analysis, there appears to be relatively little peer- reviewed research on the subject. In its place is a fairly large volume of study, of varying quality, from numerous interested parties and private organizations. While this situation presents a unique opportunity for original research, it also poses the challenge of separating objective, factual analysis from more biased or skewed reporting. Within this latter body of more recent literature, the vast majority of debate focuses on the causes of the current phase of Naxalite insurgency and speculation as to the most effective ways to deal with it. Broadly speaking, two groups with competing viewpoints emerge from all this contention. The first, or “law and order” camp, considers the Naxalite problem primarily a security issue. The main proponents of this point of view are security analysts and researchers like K.P.S. Gill and Ajai Sahni, many of them associated with India-based think tanks like the Institute for Conflict Management.11 While acknowledging socio-economic marginalization as a contributing factor, they view the lack of effective state and municipal policing, poor coordination of security efforts with New Delhi, and lenient policies toward Naxalite groups as the root causes of the insurgency. Citing numerous failed efforts at peace talks with what they view as an intransigent, nihilistic enemy, this group advocates strongly for the active suppression of Naxalism by force, with increased utilization of central government forces if necessary.12 10 For examples, see: Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment (Calcutta: Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974); Sohail Jawaid, The Naxalite Movement in India: Origin and Failure of the Maoist Revolutionary Strategy in West Bengal 1967-1971 (New Delhi: Associated Publishing House, 1979). 11 The Institute for Conflict Management, “An Introduction,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/icm/index.html (accessed July 19, 2007). 12 Much of the literature generated by these analysts is published on the ‘South Asia Terrorism Portal.’ Organized by K.P.S. Gill, the controversial ‘supercop’ who crushed the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the early 1990s, the SATP is a comprehensive resource for writings and analysis on terrorism and related security issues in South Asia. In particular, see: K.P.S. Gill, “Imperatives of Justice,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, April 30, 2005, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/07june25pio.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); K.P.S. Gill, “Blood Sweat and Anger,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, July 13, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/kpsgill/governance/06dailynewsjuly13.htm (accessed July 20, 2007); Ajai Sahni, “The Angry Men of Mao,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, February 4, 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/dailynews&analysis13022007.htm (accessed July 20, 2007). 5 In contrast, the “development” camp views Naxalism as fundamentally the result of poverty and political disenfranchisement. Represented by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and the Asian Center for Human Rights, and think tanks such as the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, this camp takes a far more holistic attitude toward the most desirable means of combating Naxal violence.13 Stressing the need for poverty reduction, land reform, and better local governance, adherents to this line of reasoning reject government sponsored violence as a solution to the Naxalite problem except in the most extreme circumstances.14 As P. V. Ramana puts it, “If the military option were effective, then the problem should not have resurfaced after the initial Naxalbari uprising was suppressed.”15 Indeed, this group views overly aggressive action on the part of security forces as one of the contributing causes of further radicalization in the countryside. At first blush, the position of Ramana and his cohorts strikes one as an oversimplification of an extremely nuanced security situation. How, for example, is development aid supposed to be distributed if the people in the process of doing so are consistently under the threat of Naxalite attack? The same can be said, however, of the “law and order” argument, and its rather singular emphasis on the use of force to quell an insurgency that doubtless draws much support from the disaffection of the rural poor. Analysis of many prior guerrilla conflicts has certainly drawn attention to the need for addressing the underlying causes of rural discontent in order to draw support away from 13 For examples, see: Asian Centre for Human Rights, “Naxal Conflict in 2006,” Asian Centre for Human Rights Report, http://pdfdownload.bofd.net/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.achrweb.org%2Freports%2Findia% 2FAR07%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Freports%2Findia%2Fnaxal0107.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007); Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Left Extremism in India: Naxal Movement in Chattisgarh & Orissa,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Special Report 25, June 2006; http://pdftohtml.ganjalinux.org/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipcs.org%2FIPCS-Special\u0002Report-25.pdf (accessed August 6, 2007). 14 Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India,” Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, August 4, 2007, http://www.ipcs.org/newIpcsSeminars2.jsp?action=showView&kValue=2362 (accessed August 6, 2007). 15 Ibid. 6 the insurgent base.16 Additionally, neither group adequately examines the efficacy of previous governmental policies and responses, a rather glaring oversight if one hopes to prescribe a current course of action. Compounding the debate is disagreement on the nature of the threat currently posed by the insurgency. The “law and order” crowd focuses almost exclusively on the movement’s implications for political stability in India, but their analysis tends to be a bit shrill.17 While there has certainly been a greater level of political instability in the regions affected by Naxalism, it has tended to remain in the country’s remote rural areas. Their assertions that the ‘Red Menace’ threatens to split India in two and seriously undermine central authority seems hyperbolic, especially given the fact that the movement draws on, at the most, 10,000 - 20,000 hard-core cadres.18 The “development camp,” by contrast, tends to view the Naxalist threat primarily in terms of its humanitarian dimension. These analysts focus on the recent internal displacement of tens of thousands of rural and tribal peoples, and the atrocities committed by both Maoist rebels and the government security forces, as the insurgency’s greatest dangers.19 While this argument is emotionally compelling, it is by no means clear that this aspect of the threat represents a serious strategic problem for New Delhi in and of itself. India’s population is enormous, and the small percentage directly affected account for only marginal contributions to overall GDP.20 What seem to be greater threats are the larger economic implications of the Naxalite insurgency in the context of India’s growth and development, and its potential for further spread as the social impacts of globalization are felt throughout the country. 16 For an excellent example of this argument, see Jeffrey Race, War Comes to Long An: Revolutionary Conflict in a Vietnamese Province (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1972). 17 Ajai Sahni, “Left Wing Extremism in India: Evolving Strategies for Containment,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, October 2006, http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/ajaisahni/crpfdelhi.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 18 Reuters, “Indian Maoist Violence,” Reuters AlertNet, June 27, 2007, http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=/db/crisisprofiles/IN_MAO.htm (accessed August 6, 2007). 19 See the aforementioned Asian Center for Human Rights Report, “Naxal Conflict in 2006” and Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies Seminar, “Naxalism and Internal Security in India.” 20 Ibid. 7 As The Economist recently noted, the five states most affected by insurgent violence account for significant mineral deposits and a majority of the nation’s energy resources.21 Also, while Naxalist expansion into the Western and Southern Deccan has received some scrutiny, no serious attention is being given to its possible spread into India’s wild Northeastern states. On initial inspection, the political stability, development level, and demography of this region appear eerily similar to those areas already afflicted by Naxalite violence.22 The fact that the Northeast also contains significant fossil fuel deposits only adds to the threat of the Maoists gaining a foothold.23 Clearly, any worthwhile examination of the dangers posed by Naxalism must take into account the changing nature of the social and economic contexts within which it operates. The analytical oversights and divergences of opinion discussed above are also reflected within the administration in New Delhi, where contradictory statements, confusion, and inconsistent policymaking characterize governmental responses to the most recent Maoist threat.24 As might be expected, these efforts have proven less than effective in countering the Naxalite problem, or even checking its growth in recent years. This manifest intellectual incoherence on the part of leaders, analysts, and policymakers has many causes, but is mainly due to a lack of perspective on the nature of the challenge confronting them. In an examination of the literature on this subject, from all the various points of view, the most striking feature is the absence of any comprehensive historical analysis of the Naxalite movement, the evolution of its organization, aims, and leadership, or how India’s own political, economic, and social development has contributed to (or ameliorated) the virulence of the movement. Given the relatively long lifespan of this 21 Economist, “India’s Politics,” Economist Intelligence Unit ViewsWire, March 19, 2007, http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8875555 (accessed August 7, 2007). 22 Cline, 126-149. 23 Jane’s Information Group, “Sentinel Security Assessment - South Asia: India, Natural Resources,” Jane’s Military and Security Assessments, April 27, 2005, http://www8.janes.com (accessed August 6, 2007). 24 P.V.

With the recent spread of Naxalite activity and the notable concern it has elicited from high levels of the Indian government, this lack of an objective, realistic, and comprehensive examination represents a significant gap in the existing literature on the subject. This thesis will aim to fill that gap. D. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES This thesis will use the comparative case study method to analyze the evolution of the Naxalite movement and assess the danger posed by the most recent upsurge in Naxalite activity. To draw an important distinction, it will not directly address the veracity of Prime Minister Singh’s assertion that “Naxalism is the single greatest internal security challenge ever faced” by his country. Given the plethora of insurgencies and violent communal movements still active in India, such an assessment would provide enough material for several lengthy theses. Instead, the central question posed here is whether the Naxalite movement currently represents a qualitatively different, and more dangerous, challenge to Indian political stability and development than it has in the past. As mentioned previously, the Naxalite insurgency is not a new phenomenon in India, and has been a thorn in the side of the country for over four decades. Generally speaking, its history can be broken down into three distinct periods, most easily distinguished by their level of insurgent activity and violence. The first period runs from the movement’s beginning in 1967 to its temporary suppression in 1972. This era encompassed the initial organization of the Naxalite movement and the rather rapid spread from its birthplace in West Bengal to a number of other states, notably Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. The second period, from 1972 until about 1991, was notable for the ideological and physical fragmentation of the movement, and its mostly localized activity in pockets of rural India. The third period (perhaps not coincidentally contemporaneous with India’s economic reforms) runs from 1991 to the present, and is distinguished by a process of gradual consolidation, culminating in the merger of the two most powerful insurgent groups (Maoist Communist Center and the 9 People’s War Group) in late 2004.25 The years since 2000 have witnessed the most dramatic escalation in the scope, breadth, and intensity of Naxalite violence. These three periods of activity will comprise the individual cases under investigation. To assess the nature and danger of the insurgency in each era, we will examine how variations in three independent variables (the socio-economic and political milieux, internal characteristics of the Naxalite movement, and governmental response) affected the dependent variable, the overall level of threat posed by the movement. These three cases will then be compared to determine whether or not the Naxalite movement indeed represents a greater danger to India than it has in the past, what specifically that danger is, and how it is likely to develop in the future. Finally, I will explore the implications for India’s continued rise and its prospects as a strategic partner of the United States. Primary and secondary source materials are utilized to the maximum extent practical. Primary sources consist largely of internal documents from the Government of India and Naxalite organizations, as well as quotes and speeches from government and insurgent leaders. As mentioned in the literature review, there is not as much rigorous academic source material on this issue as one might like. What peer-reviewed work there is receives primacy of place, but publications and studies from interested NGOs, think tanks, and security analysts also contain valuable information, and are included in this study. Finally, significant tertiary source material, in the form of coverage from reputable news media like The Economist, Frontline (an Indian weekly), and the Times of India, is required to fill factual gaps in the existing literature. E. TERMINOLOGY ISSUES For the purposes of this thesis, the generic term Maoist will refer to the Indian variety and be used interchangeably with Naxalite. Obviously, Maoist movements and organizations exist in many forms throughout the world and there are a number of others active in South Asia, most famously in Nepal. Other than a shared political ideology and 25 P.V. Ramana, “The Maoist Movement in India,” Defense and Security Analysis 22, no. 4 (December 2006): 435-449. 10 sympathy with each other’s causes, these groups remain separate and distinct entities, and care should be taken not confuse or conflate Naxalism with other Maoist movements more generally. When referring to Maoist organizations other than the Naxalites, the full name and country of origin are provided to avoid ambiguity. 11 II. THE ORGANIZATIONAL PERIOD (1967–1972) A. INTRODUCTION To inform an assessment of the relative threat posed by the current Naxalite insurgency, this chapter will undertake an historical analysis of the movement’s organization and initial activity in the period from 1967 to 1972. This era encompasses the birth of Naxalism and its fairly rapid rise as a force on the Indian political scene, and therefore presents a potentially illuminating parallel to the resurgence of violent Maoism in recent years. It also witnessed the movement’s initial failure, and so may contain useful lessons for countering the modern threat. To begin, a brief look at the history of Indian communism is in order. For the world’s largest democracy, India has a surprisingly long and complicated relationship with Marxist ideology. First emerging in 1920, in the fires of the Indian independence movement, it has grown into a major force on the sub-continent’s political scene. While all of its proponents adhere to the ultimate goal of building a utopian classless society, they have not always agreed on the most desirable method of achieving it. Nevertheless, whether motivating an underground subversive element or an aboveground, election-contesting political party, the basic ideology has proven remarkably resilient in the Indian context. Any examination of the birth of the Naxalite movement in the latter half of the 1960s requires an understanding of its development within this larger phenomenon. Jawaid Sohail, an Indian academic studying the origins of the Naxalites, divides the evolution of the Indian communist movement into six broad periods.26 From its birth until 1941, the Communist Party of India (CPI) suffered from poor organization and leadership. Outlawed by the British colonial authorities, it languished in relative obscurity. However, when Great Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union following the outbreak of World War II, the communists enjoyed a new legitimacy, 26 Jawaid, 4. 12 which they exploited by allying themselves with the popular Indian National Congress from 1941-1945. After World War II, this alliance foundered on the emerging international split between East and West, and the CPI moved into opposition against the growing power of Congress in New Delhi. Around the time of India’s independence in 1947, a struggle erupted between the peasants and their ruler in the princely state of Hyderabad, which was vacillating on accession to the Indian union. Inspired by the contemporaneous example of Mao’s “People’s Revolution” in China (and encouraged by its ideological benefactor, the Soviet Union), the CPI embarked on the fourth phase of its activity, supporting an armed agrarian uprising against feudal oppression in Hyderabad that became known as the Telangana movement. In 1948, when the Indian armed forces moved in to forcibly annex the Hyderabad principality, the Telangana insurgents turned against New Delhi. While this initial struggle achieved some degree of early success, temporarily “liberating” more than 3,000 villages and 16,000 square miles of territory, a confluence of events resulted in its ultimate demise. The strength of the Indian armed forces eventually proved overpowering, and a large number of the rebels were killed. Additionally, in an attempt to curry favor with India, the Soviet Union (which had encouraged the uprising in its earlier days) summarily withdrew its support. Taking the hint, the CPI dutifully followed suit in 1951.27 The failure of Telangana inaugurated the fifth period of communist activity, when the CPI, again at Soviet urging, sought to contest national and state elections in a bid to bring about the peaceful imposition of communist rule through democratic conduct. For many of the CPI’s more radical cadres, however, this decision was viewed as a betrayal of the Party’s revolutionary heritage. The memories of Telangana loomed large in their ideological imaginings and a sizeable faction of the CPI began to drift toward a more Maoist interpretation of Marxism-Leninism as the 1950s progressed.28 27 Ajay Mehra, “Naxalism in India: Revolution or Terror?” Terrorism and Political Violence 12, no. 2 (2000): 40-42. 28 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 20-22. 13 This rise of factionalism within the CPI defines the last of Sohail’s six phases and would reach its zenith in the 1960s. With the growing Sino-Soviet split from 1958-1964, the ideological tensions within the CPI continued to mount. These were only exacerbated by the emerging Sino-Indian border dispute in the early 1960s, in which the CPI leadership came down firmly on the side of New Delhi. The pro-Chinese leftists within the party branded this policy as revisionism of the worst sort, and attempted to wrest control from the pro-Soviet faction. Unable to muster sufficient support, they instead broke away from the CPI in 1964 to form the Communist Party of India-Marxist, or CPI- (M).29 However, the CPI-(M) was almost immediately beset by the same kind of ideological infighting that had precipitated its formation. The relatively more restrained group that formed the party’s leadership, though still hostile to the Soviet Union, grudgingly embraced electoral politics as a means of bringing about a more or less peaceful revolution in India. Consequently, when the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War broke out, it quickly condemned Pakistan and its Chinese patron in an effort to capitalize on the wave of nationalist sentiment sweeping India. This tactic proved remarkably successful, and CPI-(M) candidates enjoyed surprising success in the 1967 elections in West Bengal, firmly entrenching the new party within the Indian political process. This proved to be too much for the more radical Maoist faction, and it was within this contentious milieu that the Naxalite movement was born.30 There were now three major communist strands within India: the CPI, the CPI- (M), and the violently radical Maoists. This last group, eventually named for the birthplace of their armed struggle in Naxalbari, West Bengal, would in due course form a third, underground organization, the Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist, or CPI- (ML). Unlike its progenitors, the CPI-(ML) was totally opposed to the electoral process and espoused violent revolution as the only legitimate means of realizing its political agenda. In short, this entailed nothing less than the complete overthrow of the existing 29 Dipak K. Gupta, “The Naxalites and the Maoist Movement in India: Birth, Demise, and Reincarnation,” Democracy and Security 3, no. 2 (May 2007): 166. 30 Jawaid, 76-78. 14 political structure, corrupted as it was by the four evils of “U.S. imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, feudalism, and comprador-bureaucrat capital.”31 From 1967-1972, this group embarked on a campaign of political terror that caused no small amount of consternation to national and state governments, and resonated, at least initially, with many poor residents of West Bengal, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. To understand why, one must appreciate India’s broader political, economic, and social contexts during this period. B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The first seventeen years of India’s independence were marked by the political hegemony of the Congress Party, personified in the undisputed leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru.32 Under his charismatic influence, the fissiparous tendencies of India’s many ethnic, linguistic, religious, and social groups were kept in check, and the country emerged as a surprising beacon of political stability in South Asia. His passing in 1964, however, (and the subsequent death of his successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, after only two years in power) left the Congress Party rudderless, and the leadership that had united India’s various groups under the mantle of nationalism was gone. Over the next few years, the INC embarked on a process of infighting that diminished its iron grip on political power and allowed alternative forces of social mobilization to pose new challenges to its authority.33 From 1966-1972, this drama played out at the national level in the struggle between Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai for the position of Prime Minister and head of 31 Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Sankar Ghosh, The Naxalite Movement: A Maoist Experiment, (Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1974), 190-199. 32 For outstanding one volume histories of India, see: John Keay, India: A History (New York: Grove Press: 2000);0 Stanley Wolpert, A New History of India: 7th Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). 33 Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952-2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

While Mrs. Gandhi emerged at the head of a coalition of Congress factions, the structure proved too unwieldy to contest the 1967 national elections as effectively as it had in the past. Beset by a number of economic and social crises (discussed below), Congress suffered its worst electoral performance in history, winning only 40% of the popular vote and barely hanging on to majority in a parliament it had previously dominated.34 With its attention again focused inwardly, factional battles quickly resumed. Following another disappointing performance in the mid-term elections of 1969, the party officially split into two competing camps: Congress (O) under Morarji Desai, and Congress (R) under Indira {later Congress (I)}.35 Though she still commanded a plurality in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi now had to rely on a coalition of leftist parties to give her a working majority, a fact that complicated her ability to respond forcefully to the growing Naxalite movement. The decline in Congress hegemony at the center was mirrored by its performance in the state elections of 1967. From a position of complete dominance in nearly all the state legislatures, the party won only 1,661 of a total 3,453 contested seats.36 Moreover, for the first time, non-Congress led coalition governments came to power in a number of states. These included West Bengal and Orissa, both of which would shortly be affected by the growing Naxalite movement. Notably, the United Democratic Front (UDF) government that formed in West Bengal contained a large and influential bloc of CPI-(M) legislators, a fact that proved important on a number of counts. As previously mentioned, the party’s successful embrace of electoral politics served to further radicalize the already restive militant faction within the CPI-(M). Additionally, while the moderate members of the CPI-(M) and the Naxalites did become bitter enemies, as we shall see, the legacy of their earlier cooperation and shared ideology would greatly complicate the state government’s efforts to effectively counter their activities. The structural shifts underway on India’s political scene thus served to facilitate the emergence and spread of Naxalism in a number of ways. The temporary decline of 34 Wolpert, 382-383. 35 Ibid., 385. 36 Ibid., 383. 16 legitimacy at the center created greater instability that allowed alternative ideologies to take root, while the rise to power of a number of leftist parties (including the Communists) provided breathing room for their more extreme ideological brethren. Concurrently, the new requirements of coalition building diverted politicians’ attention from the essential task of ensuring security in their constituencies.37 To these must be added one more consideration: the fractious nature of political activity undoubtedly complicated the policymaking process at a time when the country faced a range of serious economic problems. While these did not necessarily arise as a result of the political turmoil, the ability of the system to effectively address them was certainly curtailed. 2. Economic Developments In spite of a series of Soviet-inspired Five Year Plans from 1951-1966, India remained a predominantly rural, agrarian economy. Burdened by generally inefficient and backward agricultural methods, it was extremely prone to underproduction and food shortages, a situation exacerbated by the country’s rapidly expanding population. The lack of proper irrigation and over-dependence on the seasonal monsoon rains caused widespread famine in 1952-53, and severe (if localized) food shortages in Bihar and West Bengal from 1965 to 1967.38 Perennially reliant on foreign food aid, particularly from the United States, Indira’s government was forced to seek even greater assistance from America in 1966, which she received in the form of increased wheat shipments and over $400 million U.S. for the implementation of India’s fourth Five-Year Plan.39 The focus of this plan was, in the words of Mrs. Gandhi, to “lay the foundation for a breakthrough in agriculture in the countryside,” primarily through state subsidization for a host of agrarian technology reforms that came to be known as the Green Revolution. Indeed, the combination of expanded irrigation networks, increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, and the utilization of higher-yielding crop varietals that had become available in 1965 did improve the food situation; by the early 1970s, India 37 Rabindra Ray, The Naxalites and their Ideology (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1988), 115. 38 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 212; Wolpert, 362, 380. 39 Wolpert, 380-381. 17 was self-sufficient in grain production for the first time in its history.40 Like most revolutions, however, this one took time to develop and produced a large amount of economic dislocation. Nowhere was this more evident than in West Bengal. These new technologies, while partly government sponsored, still required a fairly significant initial capital outlay to procure and utilize to their fullest advantage. Moreover, they tended to be best employed on relatively large tracts of land so cultivators could reap economies of scale in the new methods of production. As Edward Duyker points out in his study of the predominantly agrarian Santal tribe in West Bengal, this had the effect of economically favoring large landholders over smaller farmers, widening what were already significant income disparities between the two.41 In a system that had its roots in the Zamindars of the British colonial era, most of these smaller farmers were in fact sharecroppers, forced to give up as much as 50% of their harvest in rent to their jotedars, or landlords. To make matters worse, if smaller farmers were to avail themselves of the new technology at all, they often had to take out loans from village moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest, usually only worsening their economic situation.42 What these long-suffering peasants were most in need of was a comprehensive system of land reform and rural development. Given the strongly socialist leanings of both Nehru and his daughter, the failure of the government to effectively tackle these problems previously was an indication of the power of entrenched vested interests. To be sure, a number of initiatives had been implemented, notably the Community Development and Rural Extension Program under the auspices of the Ford Foundation, the Panchayati Raj program, and a series of land reform laws in the 1950s and 60s.43 Unfortunately, a combination of corruption, cronyism, and loopholes in the legislation prevented any of these measures from having much of an impact on the landless laborers, 40 Keay, 524. 41 Edward Duyker, Tribal Guerrillas: The Santals of West Bengal and the Naxalite Movement (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1987), 55-57; Sumanta Banerjee, India’s Simmering Revolution: The Naxalite Uprising (London: Zed Books Ltd., 1984), 9-12. 42 Jawaid, 40-41; Gupta, 163. 43 Wolpert, 363-364. 18 tribals, and small farmers they were designed to help.44 On the contrary, larger landowners and jotedars were often able to twist the new regulations in their favor, worsening the plight of many of the rural poor, particularly in West Bengal. Nor were economic hardships confined to the countryside. Like most of India, Calcutta had been suffering from economic stagnation for a number of years, and when the Indian government was forced to devalue the rupee in 1966, it had financial repercussions that hit the city hard. The resulting inflation spawned an industrial recession in 1966-67, causing unemployment to increase to dangerous proportions, particularly among the educated youth. While precise figures for this period are unavailable, anecdotal evidence suggests that from one third to one half of all the unemployed were aged 16-24.45 With so much economic frustration in the cities and the countryside, it is not surprising that incidents of social unrest increased as well. 3. Social Developments Given the feudal socio-economic nature of much of its history, peasant uprisings in India were not uncommon. From 1783 to 1900 alone, at the height of the British Raj, over 100 such incidents affected the region to greater or lesser degrees, many of them in the perennially restive province of Bengal.46 As the Telangana uprising in the late 1940s showed, post-independence Indian society was no less susceptible to their occurrence. In retrospect, it appears obvious that many of the factors that had precipitated these events in the past were present in the latter half of the 1960s. As the living situation deteriorated for a substantial number of India’s peasants, strikes and food riots became increasingly frequent in the later 1960s.47 By 1967, many Bengali newspapers carried accounts of impoverished rural citizens driven to suicide by their dire economic straits.48 While the 44 Banerjee, 7-9. 45 Ibid., 32. 46 Mehra, 39. 47 Wolpert, 382. 48 Banerjee, 1. 19 authenticity of all these accounts is difficult to establish, they were emblematic of the desperation and discontent of a large segment of the Indian countryside. The situation in urban society was showing signs of similar strain. Disease, overcrowding, and a lack of adequate infrastructure had long been endemic to most of India’s major cities. Now, as a result of the chronic unemployment discussed in the previous section, increasing numbers of young people were also turning to petty criminality and other anti-social behavior. Known as the “lumpen-proletariat” in Marxist circles, the activities of these idle and angry youth served to further destabilize an already fragile social situation.49 Compounding this tendency was the wave of student radicalism sweeping the world in the latter 1960s. Anti-establishment rhetoric and leftist activism were common on university campuses throughout India, but especially prevalent in Calcutta. In 1965, the Communist faction captured the leadership of the student’s union at the prestigious Presidency College and embarked on a campaign of disobedience, strikes, and protests, many of them violent.50 As clashes between police and urban youths worsened over the ensuing years, Calcutta’s student population grew more radicalized. Watching these developments from their safe houses, the leaders of the Maoist faction in the CPI-(M) grew more confident by the day. The contradictions inherent in India’s “semi-feudal and semi-colonial” society, it seemed to them, were reaching their breaking point, and the situation was ripe for the masses to rise up and finally deliver India from its centuries of capitalist domination. To ignite this potent mixture of urban and rural unrest, all that was needed was a spark. 49 Banerjee, 33. 50 Ibid., 50-52. 20 C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Two men in particular laid the groundwork for Naxalism’s emergence in 1967. Kanu Sanyal, a long-time CPI-(M) organizer active among the Santal tribals in Darjeeling, was among those within the party who disagreed strongly with its newly conciliatory leanings toward New Delhi and electoral politics. He discovered an ideological mentor in a passionate but lesser known party functionary, Charu Mazumdar.51 Mazumdar, born to a high caste family in Darjeeling district in 1918, had joined the Communist movement as a young man while attending university, and remained active in the CPI and CPI-(M) for most of his adult life. By the mid-1960s, he had wholeheartedly embraced Maoism as the only valid form of Communist struggle for the Indian situation. Adhering to Mao’s dictum that “political power grows from the barrel of a gun,” Mazumdar utterly rejected electoral politics and sought to apply the lessons of the Chinese revolution, as he saw them, to the struggle in his own country.52 In this, he was greatly influenced by the writings of Lin Biao, the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and his strategic formulations for guerrilla warfare.53 Mazumdar laid out his theories in a series of essays penned between 1965 and 1967 that served as something of a manifesto for his more radical comrades, particularly in West Bengal.54 In those two years, elements of the CPI-(M) started veering on a more overtly militant course. Under the guidance of Sanyal and Mazumdar, on March 3, 1967, an uprising of poor tribals and peasants erupted in the village of Naxalbari, in the Siliguri sub-division of Darjeeling. While initially confined to the seizure of land and food-grains hoarded by the jotedars, it soon turned violent and began spreading to other villages in Siliguri. By 51 Prakash Singh, The Naxalite Movement in India (New Delhi: Rupa & Co., 2006), 268-274. 52 Jawaid, 55. 53 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 126-127. 54 Biplab Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” Social Scientist 6, no. 12 (July 1978): 8- 10. 21 July 5, the movement had grown large enough to attract the attention of its ideological progenitor, the Communist Party of China (CPC), which, in an editorial in Beijing’s People’s Daily, lauded it as “a peal of spring thunder [that] has crashed over the land of India,” and “a development of tremendous significance for the Indian people’s revolutionary struggle.”55 In reality, the rebellion was not quite that momentous at this stage, as the ease with which it was put down by the West Bengal government would attest. In late July, increased police action and a near total lack of coordination within the movement began to take their toll, and the initial uprising disintegrated by September.56 Nevertheless, the fire had been lit. Mazumdar emerged as a revolutionary leader and his ideology attracted an increasing number of adherents. Now known as Naxalites, militant groups inspired by Mazumdar’s theories began appearing throughout India. Emboldened by China’s rhetorical support, Mazumdar and these like-minded radicals officially broke from the CPI-(M). In November 1967, the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries (AICCR, later renamed the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, AICCCR) was formed in an attempt to gather the various strands of Naxalism under the banner of one revolutionary party.57 Though largely successful, the deliberations in this body revealed a number of ideological differences among the groups that would prove extremely divisive in a few years. In two cases, that of the Andhra faction of the AICCCR led by Nagi Reddy and another group known as Dakshin Desh, the differences proved insurmountable at an early stage, resulting in their exclusion from the nascent organization. Nevertheless, in April 1969, the formation of the CPI-(ML), with Mazumdar at the head, was announced in Calcutta and quickly endorsed by the CPC.58 It had an estimated 17,000 members at its founding, the majority in Andhra 55 People’s Daily, “ Spring Thunder Breaks Over India,” July 5, 1967, reprinted in Prakash Singh, 259-264. While China did offer significant rhetorical support to the Naxalite movement early on, particularly through editorials in the People’s Daily and broadcasts on the government controlled Xinhua News Agency, there is little evidence of any more concrete assistance. . 56 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 12. 57 Ibid., 31. 58 Ibid., 33. 22 Pradesh and West Bengal.59 For the next three years, the CPI-(ML) would be the dominant face of Naxalism in India. With the pronouncement that the “Chinese Chairman is our Chairman, the Chinese path is our path,” Mazumdar’s agenda for the Naxalites was codified at the First Party Congress in May 1970. It explicitly called for a Maoist inspired violent overthrow of the Indian government by establishing liberated bases in the countryside, surrounding the cities, and eventually subsuming all of India within its “people’s democratic revolution.”60 While Mazumdar’s heady optimism may be understandable in the international political context of the late 1960s, the techniques he advocated for accomplishing these objectives were questionable, to say the least. 2. Strategy and Tactics Mazumdar’s strategy was predicated on the assumption that the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of India’s rural poor had reached the breaking point.61 In his estimation, the situation was ripe for a spontaneous uprising of the beleaguered peasants that would sweep the old political order from the scene in a few short years. In a 1968 article in Liberation, the Naxalites’ primary propaganda mouthpiece, Mazumdar opined that the People’s Liberation Army would be marching through the countryside “by the beginning of 1971, if not in 1970.”62 This outlook informed his strategic formulations in a number of ways. The first was an emphasis on the rural peasants as the true base of the revolution.63 The focus of revolutionary activity was squarely on the countryside, with urban agitation initially prohibited. However, with the majority of the rural population illiterate, Mazumdar was forced to rely on educated ideologues to form the ground level leadership of his organization. To this end, he encouraged the recruitment and 59 Rabindra Ray, 108. 60 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist),” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 199; Jawaid, 36. 61 Ibid.,194. 62 Charu Mazumdar, writing in Liberation, Nov 1968, as reported in Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 63 “Programme of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist,” May 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 194. 23 participation of educated urban youth, but demanded they leave the cities and adopt the ways of the local villagers to better indoctrinate and lead them in their revolutionary struggle.64 While a large number of radicalized college students (especially from Calcutta) heeded this call, their insinuation into rural society was highly problematic. Most were quite incapable of adapting to village life, and their different customs engendered suspicion from the more parochial tribals and farmers.65 As a result, while peasants were often capable of being motivated for local actions, they generally failed to adopt Naxalism’s broader ideology.66 As Dipak Gupta notes, the vast majority of activist cadres were educated and from upper caste Hindu families, with poor, illiterate peasants accounting for less than 20% of the committed membership.67 One reason for this apathy among the peasants may have been the Naxalites’ renunciation of mass movements, the second pillar of Mazumdar’s strategy. In his estimation, since the country was on the verge of a spontaneous revolution, it needed no organizing force to guide it. Indeed, mass organizations could only hurt the movement, as they would give the enemy a focus for retaliation.68 While the formation of the CPI- (ML) may seem to contradict this outlook, in reality, the party functioned more symbolically than as a classical political or military organization. While Mazumdar’s ideology did reign supreme, operational control was actually quite decentralized, with village and district level organizations enjoying almost complete autonomy. This situation utterly precluded the development of any sort of broader economic or social agenda that might have been useful in attracting greater peasant support. In fact, Mazumdar believed that attention devoted to social or economic programs could only detract from the primary goal of seizing political power from the state, and actively discouraged their formulation.69 64 Ghosh, 109. 65 Gupta, 173-174; Jawaid, 95. 66 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57-59. 67 Gupta, 171. 68 Ghosh, 101. 69 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 58-59. 24 Rather than offering hope, Mazumdar contended that the way to inspire India’s poor was to offer the opportunity for revenge. This accounted for the third pillar of his overall strategy, which he dubbed the “annihilation of class enemies.”70 As the name suggests, this entailed the deliberately brutal murder of jotedars, moneylenders, and agents of the government in an effort to spread “red terror” throughout the countryside.71 With the injunction that “he who has not dipped his hand in the blood of class enemies can hardly be called a communist,” the implementation of this campaign became the primary goal of Naxalite cadres throughout India.72 While it did succeed in driving off the landowning elite in some of the affected areas, the sadistic nature of the killings eventually alienated many more of the peasants than it inspired.73 The tactics that Mazumdar prescribed for the execution of the annihilation strategy were similarly self-defeating. Believing that an obsession with the acquisition of firearms would only distract the peasants from their spontaneous revolutionary zeal, he initially forbade their use by any but the party’s leadership, and even these he limited to purposes of self-defense. In the application of the terror campaign, the cadres were only permitted to use traditional weapons like spears, sickles, and bows and arrows. His emphasis on decentralization also stressed the primacy of village level squads, usually of no more than seven members, at the expense of larger formations of fighters.74 Though he later paid lip service to the need for organizing a ‘People’s Liberation Army’ along more conventional lines, there was never any serious attempt to form such a force.75 These tactical decisions left the Naxalites at a decided disadvantage against the comparatively well armed and organized government security forces that eventually moved in to counter them. 70 Charu Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” Liberation, February 1970, reprinted in Ghosh, 290-297. 71 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 45-46. 72 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 294. 73 Dasgupta. The Naxalite Movement, 58, 64. 74 Mazumdar, “A Few Words About Guerrilla Actions,” reprinted in Ghosh, 291. 75 Banerjee, 204-206. 25 For all their operational errors, however, a temporarily accommodating political climate allowed the Naxalites to embark on a series of campaigns that caused no small amount of instability in the regions they affected. From the formation of the party in 1969 until July of 1971, they were a force to be reckoned with in a number of Indian states. 3. Naxalite Activity While Naxalite activity and violence in this period were reported from as far afield as Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, the Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, the bulk remained confined to West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.76 It was in these two states that the annihilation program was most effectively implemented and where the Naxalites had their greatest political impact. Perhaps surprisingly, the first large-scale campaign after Naxalbari came not in West Bengal, but in Srikakulum district of Andhra Pradesh. Srikakulum’s history of peasant unrest predated the Naxalites, emerging as early as 1961 in the form of agitation by the native Girijan tribals against the economic oppression of the landholding class. While this was usually relatively peaceful, the example and influence of Naxalbari soon turned it violent. By late 1968, under the leadership of a number of imported Naxalite cadres, the Girijans were becoming increasingly militant. In 1969, they embarked on a classic annihilation campaign for political control, killing more than 150 people and eventually extending their writ over more than 500 square miles. While Mazumdar’s hopes were high for this “liberated area,” the movement proved more fragile than it appeared. Coordinated action by the security forces resulted in the deaths or arrests of top Naxalite leaders in the district, and Girijan support for the insurgency dissipated by mid-1970.77 In late 1969, the Naxalites launched another offensive in the Midnapur district of West Bengal. Like Srikakulum, it was a classic annihilation campaign with exclusively 76 Singh, 45-81. 77 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 46-52. 26 political aims. In Midnapur, however, the leadership that instigated the rebellion was not composed of older party cadres, but young students from Calcutta.78 Led by Ashit Chatterjee and Santosh Rana, the movement achieved some early success, accounting for the deaths of around 100 ‘class enemies’ and considerable economic disruption. Like Srikakulum, however, the uprising proved unsustainable and collapsed in the face of pressure from the security forces in early 1970.79 Birbhum in West Bengal, Muzzafarpur in Bihar, and the Palia district of Uttar Pradesh also witnessed organized Naxalite activity in 1969-1970. Like all the other rural uprisings, however, their early intensity masked fundamental weaknesses, and they died out almost as dramatically as they had flared up.80 Ironically, Naxalism’s last major campaign in this period occurred not in the countryside, but in Calcutta. Perhaps in desperation at the failures of its rural campaigns, the CPI-(ML) made an abrupt strategic reversal and launched a “cultural revolution” in West Bengal’s teeming capital in April 1970.81 While some observers have described this surprising development as a spontaneous movement by the urban Naxalite cadres, it is clear that Mazumdar himself guided the emergence of this new front at an early stage. Initially, the focus of the movement was on the destruction of symbols of bourgeoisie culture. These included cinemas, universities, and statues of iconic Indian figures like Mahatma Gandhi. Within a few months, however, the annihilation campaign appeared in Calcutta. Initially targeting police officers, its focus soon shifted to CPI-(M) politicians and activists, and even middle-class businessmen.82 The fact that Naxalite violence had now arrived in a major city occasioned great alarm throughout the country, not least in New Delhi. As the insurgency grew more violent through 1970 and early 1971, however, it became apparent that it was losing its ideological focus. In large part, this was due to a dramatic shift in the makeup of the party’s membership. While upper class university 78 Ghosh, 78-79; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 57. 79 Singh, 63. 80 Ibid., 64-74. 81 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 68-77. 82 Ibid., 79-91. 27 students had been an important component of the early Naxalite movement, by 1970, most had either been arrested or dropped out in revulsion at the excesses of the annihilation campaign. In their place, shiftless youth, petty criminals, and other anti\u0002social elements had risen to prominence in the urban faction of the CPI-(ML). Under the guise of class struggle, extortion, theft, and personally motivated murders by party cadres grew increasingly common. Unsurprisingly, this did little to endear the Naxalites to the majority of Calcutta society. Already alienated by the statue smashing campaign and other petty vandalism, the public turned decisively against them in 1971.83 As a result of this string of failures, the ideological cracks in the leadership of the CPI-(ML) that had been evident at its founding widened into chasms. Mazumdar was increasingly the target of pointed criticism from other Naxalite leaders on a number of issues.84 Prominent among these were his adoption of the annihilation strategy as the primary form of struggle, his total neglect of the urban proletariat as a target of agitation, and the wisdom of his prohibition of all mass organization - in short, all the tenets of his grand strategy. To make matters worse, he had also lost the rhetorical support of the CPC. In late 1970, the Chinese government sent a message to Mazumdar echoing many of the same criticisms that were emanating from within his own party.85 Shortly thereafter, its radio broadcasts in support of the CPI-(ML) ceased.86 Though still claiming allegiance to Beijing, Mazumdar diverged from the CPC line in 1971 by vocally supporting the uprising in East Pakistan against Yahya Khan’s government. This proved to be the last straw for many other Naxalite leaders, who finally broke ranks with this betrayal of China’s ideological direction.87 With the leadership hopelessly divided, the rural campaign in tatters, and the lumpen-proletariat dominating the urban scene, the 83 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 94-102. 84 Sohail, 45-49. 85 Ghosh, 12-21. 86 Banerjee, 170. 87 Banerjee, 247-248; Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 192-193. 28 Naxalite movement was foundering badly. Nevertheless, it would take concerted action by the central and state governments to definitively put an end to this era of Naxalite activity. D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses Initially, the government in New Delhi paid scant attention to the outbreak of violence in Naxalbari. Viewing the situation primarily as a localized law and order problem, it did little more than express its opinion to West Bengal that the situation should be dealt with swiftly.88 To be fair, in spite of the attention it received as a result of the CPC’s endorsement, the early movement was too weak and disorganized to merit much more of a reaction. Even as Naxalism organized and spread through 1968-69, it still failed to elicit much of an official response. As mentioned previously, this was probably due to the distraction provided by the leadership battles and other political machinations that occupied the center during these years. By 1970, however, the situation was beginning to change. The emergence of Naxalite violence in Calcutta, one of India’s largest cities, was too worrisome a development to ignore. On August 11, 1970, Indira Gandhi pronounced that the government would fight the Naxalites with “all the strength at its command.”89 Securing the elections in early 1971 provided a pretext for the deployment of military and paramilitary forces to some of the worst Naxal-affected districts.90 In July 1971, the center launched Operation Steeplechase, a coordinated campaign by the Indian army, the Central Reserve Police Force, and local police across contiguous districts in West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa that were still affected by Naxalite violence. This area encompassed West Bengal’s Midnapur and Birbhum districts, and the cadres still active were largely holdovers from those earlier campaign. While Steeplechase was not a complete success, 88 Ghosh, 37. 89 Singh, 112. 90 Ghosh, xxii. 29 in that a sizeable number of activists escaped the police dragnet, it did achieve some noteworthy results: hundreds of Naxalites were arrested, large caches of weapons were seized, and most importantly, the rural population’s confidence in the strength of the government was restored.91 New Delhi also attempted to undercut the grass-roots appeal of Naxalism by championing a number of rural development and land reform schemes.92 The West Bengal Land Reform Act, passed in January 1970, was one such initiative. It imposed ceilings on the total acreage individual families were allowed to hold and reduced the maximum rent that landlords could charge their sharecroppers. As usual, the law was filled with loopholes, and the ever-present corruption and conflicts of interest severely curtailed its overall efficacy.93 Nevertheless, it did help some of the landless poor and scored political points at the expense of the Naxalites. For all the efforts of the central government, however, Naxal violence remained fundamentally a state problem. India’s Constitution devolved authority over internal security to the states, and it was their policies and initiatives that mattered most.94 Of course, if a state proved incapable of handling its own affairs, there was a constitutional answer for that, too. 2. State Responses In Andhra Pradesh, a determined state government, united under firm Congress Party rule, was able to cope with the violence in Srikakulum on its own. While allegations of police brutality and ‘encounter killings’ were common, the swift and effective application of force by the state police broke the back of the insurgency there in a matter of months.95 The situation in West Bengal was somewhat more complicated. With the CPI-(M) occupying key leadership positions in the United Democratic Front 91 Singh, 99-100. 92 Wolpert 389; Jawaid, 98-100. 93 Jawaid, 86-89. 94 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Annual Report 2006-07, 1. 95 Ghosh, 84. 30 government, West Bengal’s response to the emergence of Naxalism was initially quite tepid. This was largely due to infighting between the members of the coalition. While other parties argued for a strong response to the initial outbreak of violence in Naxalbari, the CPI-(M) vacillated. Though it wanted to reign in its adventurist cadres in Siliguri, it was fearful of damaging its revolutionary credentials by authorizing too forceful a response. Additionally, the agitators were still members of the CPI-(M) at this stage, and the party was hopeful of bringing them back into its fold. As a result, police actions in response to the increasing violence through July 1967 were quite circumscribed.96 By the time a deteriorating situation forced the government’s hand in August and September, the movement had already attracted a sizeable following. While the insurrection in Naxalbari was effectively put down in a relatively short period of time, the damage had been done. Though the inability of the UDF to effectively govern forced its dissolution in November 1967, mid-term elections returned it to power in February 1969. With broadly the same makeup, it proved even less capable of agreement in policymaking, particularly with respect to the Naxalites. Not only did the government fail to outlaw the movement, some of its constituent parties actually sought to curry favor with the Maoists in a bid to strengthen their popularity with rural voters.97 Again, this resulted in a generally weak security response, with the police budget actually reduced just as the activity in Midnapur and Calcutta was beginning to heat up.98 With the coalition hopelessly polarized and the security situation deteriorating, New Delhi imposed President’s Rule on West Bengal in March 1970. President’s Rule, an administrative device under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the center to assume executive authority in a state if the ruling government can no longer form a majority in the state legislature.99 With the governor 96 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 9. 97 Jawaid, 96-97. 98 Ibid., 73. 99 Government of India, Constitution of India, Ministry of Laws and Justice, http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/welcome.html (accessed December 11, 2007). 31 (as an agent of New Delhi) now firmly in charge, the security situation began to improve rapidly. The 1932 Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrage Act was quickly revived, giving the police expanded powers of detention.100 Funding for the state police forces more than doubled, and the number of officers rose dramatically.101 Augmented by personnel from the center’s Border Security Force, these additional men were posted to hotbeds of Naxalite activity, especially Siliguri, Midnapur, and Calcutta. In April, a joint operation by the Indian military and the Central Reserve Police Force, in coordination with state police, successfully put down the Midnapur uprising in a matter of weeks.102 Though it took a while longer, the expanded presence in Calcutta also proved effective. Aided by government sponsored volunteer militias, ironically drawn from the same lumpen-proletariat element the Naxalites had utilized, forceful policing resulted in the deaths or arrest of thousands of Naxalite cadres and sympathizers.103 As in Andhra Pradesh, abuses by the anti-Naxal forces were not uncommon – in one notorious instance, 300 armed members of a volunteer militia rampaged through a Naxalite stronghold in the Cossipore-Baranagore neighborhood of Calcutta, killing nearly 100 suspected Naxalites in cold blood.104 Though brutal, the tactics were effective. By the end of 1971, Mazumdar was forced to officially abandon the urban campaign in the face of mounting losses.105 The movement was by this time a spent force, and its fortunes continued to decline as top leadership was caught up in the tightening police dragnet through the first half of 1972. Finally, on July 16, 1972, Charu Mazumdar himself was arrested from a safe house in the Calcutta suburb of Entally. On July 28, he died in police custody at the age of 54. The death of Mazumdar was a fittingly symbolic denouement to the movement that had burned so brightly for over five years. With the departure of its spiritual and ideological leader, the first phase of Naxalite activity in India was over. 100 Jawaid, 83-84. 101 Ibid., 85. 102 Gupta, 171. 103 Jawaid, 84. 104 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 92. 105 Banerjee, 213. 32 E. CONCLUSION This chapter has analyzed the birth, rise, and eventual decline of the Naxalite insurgency from 1967-1972. The emergence of Naxalism in 1967 was ultimately attributable to a number of factors. Persistent poverty and growing inequality in the countryside produced a groundswell of discontentment in the poor rural population. Deeply frustrated with their government, some peasants and tribals were willing to entertain any alternative ideology that promised empowerment and greater equity; though it was certainly the most violent, Naxalism was just one of a number of socio-political movements that began to emerge at this time.106 Concurrently, political instability brought by the initial weakening of the INC’s hegemony provided room for these alternative ideologies to grow. Finally, leftist revolutionary rhetoric was ubiquitous in the late 1960s, both domestically and internationally. This provided a veneer of ideological sophistication to a movement that offered little more than violence, and allowed it to challenge the state’s legitimacy, at least for a while. However, while the Naxalite movement during this period drew much attention from the press and occasioned a great deal of worry in New Delhi and elsewhere, it seems clear in hindsight that the danger was not as great as many feared at the time. Although Naxalism touched almost every part of the country from 1967-1972, its activities were widely dispersed, and it never controlled more than 200 of India’s 56,000 rural villages at any one time.107 As militant Communism blossomed throughout much of the third world in the late 1960s, it may seem surprising that it failed to gain more traction in the Indian context, beset as it was by many of the same socio-economic problems evident in Southeast Asia or Latin America. In the final analysis, much of the responsibility for the ultimate failure of the Naxalite movement in this period must be laid at the feet of Charu Mazumdar. 106 Some others included movements based on language, caste, and even the rural-urban divide. For a discussion of these phenomena, see: Yadav and Palshikar, 92-96. 107 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 62. 33 The man regarded as ‘India’s Mao Zedong\" proved to be a much less competent leader than his Chinese namesake. Ideologically, his blind application of the Chinese revolutionary model to India overlooked fundamental differences between the two countries. India’s governmental apparatus was much more powerful than its Chinese counterpart had been in the late 1940s. The institution of parliamentary democracy had become well entrenched in India, and it would take more than temporary economic hardships to undermine its widespread support. Additionally, despite its faltering in the elections of 1967, the Congress Party proved to be enduringly popular. The INC was granted an impressive mandate in the 1971 and 1972 elections at both the state and national levels, demonstrating that it retained the support of a majority of the Indian population.108 Therefore, while Mazumdar correctly identified the rising levels of discontent in Indian society, he totally misread the resultant potential for a rapid revolution. The majority of India’s peasants were concerned with local social and economic issues, and remained unmoved by Naxalite political ideology. As it turned out, most of Mazumdar’s strategic and operational initiatives actually proved counterproductive in winning over India’s masses. His single-minded focus on the seizure of political power and utter contempt for mass organization precluded the development of any socio-economic agenda that might have been useful in garnering broad rural support. While this was supposed to be achieved through the application of the annihilation campaign, the brutality of this program actually alienated the majority of peasants. When it was extended to urban areas during the Calcutta campaign, it had the same effect on most city residents; the ill-conceived “cultural revolution” and the excesses of the lumpen-proletariat faction only exacerbated this revulsion. In the end, Mazumdar’s strategic choices effectively denied his movement any base of popular support. Nor did he better acquit himself in his tactical formulations. The curious prohibition on firearms left his cadres woefully outgunned by the military and police. Additionally, his penchant for decentralization severely restricted the Naxalites’ ability to 108 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 229-231; Wolpert, 389. 34 adapt to changing military circumstances. Even as the scale of the government’s security operations grew from 1967-1972, the Maoists continued to emphasize small, village-level units at the expense of a more sizeable and coherent military organization. Time and again, these proved incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the larger, better equipped, and more highly organized forces arrayed against them. While Mazumdar’s inept leadership set the stage for the movement’s demise, the overall effectiveness of the government’s response must also be acknowledged. With the exception of the UDF initiatives in West Bengal, robust and forceful responses by state and central security forces were eventually successful in putting down all the uprisings. While these did involve a number of human rights abuses, the growing public disgust with Naxalite violence meant that most Indians seemed to accept these aggressive policing methods.109 Simultaneously, all levels of government increased funding for land reforms and rural development programs in an effort to address the socio-economic inequities that had helped spark the outbreak of violence. While these did not always work as they were intended, they did succeed in winning back the support of the rural poor. The final contributor to the failure of the Naxalite movement in this period was its overall organizational weakness. Mazumdar’s charismatic personality had papered over the movement’s fissiparous tendencies in 1967, but these forces could not be contained for long. Ideological differences and powerful egos erupted again in late 1970, and the leadership had irrevocably fractured by 1972. The CPI-(ML) splintered into a number of different factions, including the Maoist Communist Centre, the Proletarian Party, and a grouping of the CPI-(ML)’s Regional Committees of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.110 Along with Dakshin Desh and the Nagi Reddy Group, these localized, weakened, and divided organizations would be the diminished face of Naxalism through its next period of activity, 1972-1991. 109 Gupta, 173 110 Jawaid, 94. 35 III. THE FRAGMENTARY PERIOD (1972-1991) A. INTRODUCTION In 1972, the Naxalites emerged from the failures and setbacks at the end of the Organizational Period in a critically weakened state: their founder and most influential leader, Charu Mazumdar, was dead; their surviving leadership was rotting in jail after a brutally effective government crackdown; their activists were disillusioned and demoralized after a succession of defeats; and the excesses of revolutionary zeal had alienated them from the vast majority of the Indian public. Given this litany of woes, most observers could be forgiven for assuming that the movement was as good as dead. As it turned out, the flame ignited at Naxalbari had not extinguished – it was, however, reduced to a smoldering ember that was very nearly snuffed out over the course of the next two decades.111 The years from 1972-1991 unquestionably marked the nadir of the Naxalite movement in India. Battered by the government’s security forces in the previous period, it desperately needed to reunify and consolidate its position. Instead, it was repeatedly fragmented by disagreements over ideological abstractions, strategic formulations, and even personal egos. The result was a proliferation of small, localized groups that proved utterly incapable of mounting any effective challenge to the Indian government. In short, the story of the Naxalites in this period is a rather boring one compared to the events of 1965-1972. It is, nonetheless, one worth examining. For the purposes of analyzing Naxalism’s resurgence after 1991, this period is important on three counts. First, it acted as a bridge between the two periods of relatively high Naxalite activity. Secondly, it gave rise to the factions that turned into the dominant Naxalite groups of the current era; clearly, any study of these organizations must take into account the circumstances of their birth. Lastly, determining the reasons for the movement’s inability to gain traction in the past should help in prescribing effective ways to counter its spread in future. 111 This analogy is borrowed, with appreciation, from Prakash Singh’s The Naxalite Movement in India. 36 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments The 1970s and 80s were a transitional period in Indian politics. The instability of 1965-1971, discussed in the preceding chapter, was the first indication that the institution of one-party hegemony known as the ‘Congress System’ was not as unshakeable as it had previously appeared.112 Though Indira’s party enjoyed landslide victories at the state and national levels in 1971 and 1972, successfully consolidating the INC and the country under the banner of her leadership, this apparent return to the stability of the old ‘Congress system’ belied a number of emerging structural changes in the Indian polity. Chief among these were the increasing politicization of lower and middle classes and castes, the rising importance of local-level issues, and the resultant emergence of regional and state level parties. While these processes evolved gradually, they set the stage for the tremendous changes that would occur on the Indian political scene in the 1990s, and helped make politics in these two decades more complex than it had been in the past. Though a thorough examination of these phenomena is outside the scope of this thesis, they indirectly impacted the course of Naxalism in a number of ways.113 One was through political developments in New Delhi. As previously alluded, Congress (I) emerged in 1972 with firm control of the national government. In light of the changing political scene, the party was remarkably effective in maintaining its grip on power for the remainder of this period, only relinquishing it during two brief interludes of Janata Party-led coalition government, in 1977-1980 and 1989-1991. In retrospect, this success was largely due to Indira’s political guile and capacity for heavy-handed authoritarianism. Recognizing that anti-colonial nationalism was no longer an effective rallying cry for the masses, she sought to mobilize support by turning to a more populist 112 Rajni Kothari, “The Congress ‘System’ in India,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 58-70. 113 For an excellent examination of structural changes in Indian politics during this period, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 73-113. 37 message.114 Though Congress remained the party of India’s industrial classes, it also began to reemphasize its socialist roots. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, agricultural development, poverty reduction, and economic self-sufficiency featured prominently in Congress’ platform, successfully attracting significant portions of the lower classes and castes.115 This shift in message did more than win elections – it also boosted the government’s legitimacy with India’s poor, thereby undercutting the appeal of alternative ideologies like Naxalism. When rhetoric proved insufficient in maintaining Congress hegemony, however, the party was not averse to taking more extreme measures. The imposition of the ‘Emergency’ from June 1975 to March 1977 demonstrated this most strikingly. Faced with declining popularity and a series of legal challenges to her rule, Mrs. Gandhi temporarily abrogated the constitution, suspended all civil rights, jailed opposition political figures, and instituted martial law throughout the country.116 Though democracy and the rule of law were reinstated with the national elections in 1977, Indira, and the Congress Party more generally, showed themselves more than willing to deal harshly with political opposition. As we will see, this resulted in a usually muscular response to separatist movements and other insurrections, including those of the Naxalite groups. Developments at the state level were also important. Throughout the early 1970s and the period of the Emergency, Congress governments retained power in the vast majority of the Indian states. However, after the INC’s temporary defeat at the center in 1977, the number and influence of state-level parties accelerated dramatically. Significantly, this phenomenon began in those areas most affected by Naxalism during the previous period, with the emergence of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh and the resurgence of the CPI-(M) in West Bengal.117 The growth of these parties, many of which depended on tenant farmers and landless laborers for their 114 Yadav and Palshikar, 96. 115 Wolpert, 389-410. 116 Ibid., 398-399. 117 Yadav and Palshikar, 106-112. 38 primary constituencies, gave a new political voice to groups that had been effectively disenfranchised in the past. Their inclusion in the political process helped keep rural unrest in check and brought an added impetus for meaningful action on economic issues that were dear to this large demographic. 2. Economic Developments India’s economy during this period was something of a mixed bag. At the macro level, Congress’ socialist policies, the persistence of an overbearing public sector epitomized by the ‘License Raj’ and a strategy of import-substitution industrialization introduced significant distortions in the economy that stifled growth the country so desperately needed. While overall GDP increased at an average of 3.5 percent throughout the 1970s, an exploding population meant the corresponding rate per capita was only 1.3 percent, far below that of the rest of the developing world. Though tepid attempts at liberalization resulted in slightly higher growth rates in the 1980s, their incomplete nature resulted in a balance of payments crisis that ultimately proved unsustainable and precipitated the economic reforms of the 1990s.118 On the other hand, the benefits of the Green Revolution were finally becoming more evenly distributed, and Congress’ newfound political populism translated into a slew of rural and agricultural development initiatives and aid programs.119 For the country’s poor farmers at least, the picture was finally becoming a bit brighter. Indira’s initial reforms after the 1971 elections were ambitious in scope and included land-reform legislation, rural employment programs, nationalization of food markets, and investment in transportation infrastructure designed to help farmers get their product to market. These were consolidated in the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, launched in 1974, the explicit aims of which were the “removal of poverty” and the “attainment of economic self-reliance.” For all its optimism, the plan’s designs were complicated by the same corruption and conflicts of interest that had plagued reform efforts in previous eras. Additionally, the worldwide oil shocks of the early 1970s 118 Gurcharan Das, “The India Model,” Foreign Affairs 85, no. 4 (July/August 2006): 4-5. 119 Wolpert, 387-388; Jawaid, 100-102. 39 brought massive inflation that substantially diminished economic growth in real terms. Bihar and Gujarat erupted in riots and protests at the diminishing economic situation, and a national railroad strike threatened to bring the country to a standstill and compound its economic problems.120 Though political factors contributed more directly to the imposition of the Emergency in 1975, Indira used her newfound power to tackle the economic challenges facing the country. Her ‘Twenty-Point Program’ of economic development was very similar to the country’s Fifth Five Year Plan, but with political opposition sidelined, Mrs. Gandhi was able to force its implementation more effectively.121 For all its authoritarianism, the Program was remarkably successful in getting the economic situation under control and finally bringing some relief to farmers and the rural poor. Inflation was successfully tamed, food prices retreated to their 1971 levels, and agricultural investment and subsidies began reaching the people that truly needed them.122 When the Emergency was repealed and the Janata government came to power in 1977, the coalition proved so weak and the government so ineffectual that economic problems returned almost immediately. Inflation and unemployment skyrocketed, and Congress returned to power in 1980 with the slogan “Elect a Government that Works!”123 Though she initially tried to cut agricultural subsidies, the political backlash convinced Indira and her party that the rural interests would still have to be placated. The Sixth Five Year Plan brought numerous anti-poverty initiatives like the Integrated Rural Development Program and the National Rural Employment Program, and inaugurated huge agricultural subsidies that continued throughout the 1980s.124 In sum, while overall economic performance throughout this period was relatively mediocre, the numerous development initiatives meant the plight of the rural poor ceased to deteriorate as it had 120 Wolpert, 396-397. 121 Ibid., 400. 122 Ibid., 403. 123 Ibid., 407-410. 124 Banerjee, 293. 40 from 1965-1972. In fact, the rural poverty rate declined relatively dramatically over this period, from 56% in 1973 to only 39% by 1988.125 This is not to imply that these programs were unqualified successes; corruption and conflicts of interest continued to hamper their implementation, and their benefits were far from uniformly distributed. Nevertheless, they were successful enough to alleviate some of the income disparities that had stoked the fires of Naxalism in the previous period, and diminished economic and class issues as a source of social unrest.126 3. Social Developments Despite the attenuation of economic inequity as a source of social strife, the 1970s and ‘80s witnessed the birth of new ethnic and religious cleavages in India’s heterogeneous society, precipitating the rise of a number of new communal and secessionist movements. Though none of these were directly connected to the phenomenon of Naxalism, their emergence and the government’s response did have implications for the Maoists’ fortunes. Two of the most prominent of these movements occurred in the Punjab and India’s wild Northeast. In the late 1970s, a wave of unrest swept India’s ‘Seven Sisters,’ the small and predominantly tribal states east of the Siliguri corridor. While the trouble started in response to an influx of Bengali refugees in the wake of the 1971 Indo-Pak War, it soon took on a distinctly separatist character.127 Historically, the region had only the loosest association with the rest of the subcontinent and was much more culturally bound to neighboring areas of Burma than to the rest of India. By the early 1980s, the Assamese, Bodo, Naga, and Mizo peoples had launched a series of violent secessionist movements, many of which continue to the present day. In response, New Delhi imposed martial law and dispatched the military and central police forces to put down the rebellions.

The Sikh community had agitated for a separate Sikh nation, notionally known as Khalistan, since around the time of Partition and Independence in 1947. The movement had been largely peaceful in the intervening decades, but by the late 1970s, it was becoming more belligerent. Under the leadership of J. S. Bhindranwale, a Sikh religious guru, armed members of the separatist Akali Dal Party stormed the Golden Temple at Amritsar in a direct challenge to New Delhi’s authority. In response to the rising violence and lawlessness throughout the Punjab, Indira’s actions were swift and uncompromising. In June of 1984, the Indian Army launched ‘Operation Bluestar,’ retaking the Golden Temple by force and inflicting massive casualties on its Sikh defenders.129 The operation cost Mrs. Gandhi her life (she was shortly thereafter assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards) and did not end the Khalistan movement immediately. It did, however, set the tone for the center’s response through the remainder of the decade.130 Extremely aggressive security actions continued, and ultimately proved successful in putting down the insurrection by the early 1990s. For the Naxalites, the impact of unrest in the Punjab and the Northeast was twofold. First, it seems likely that the threats to the integrity of the nation served to rally significant portions of the electorate to the government, giving New Delhi an added source of legitimacy. Much as the government enjoyed a boost of popularity in 1971-72 during the Indo-Pak war, the actions against the animist tribals and (especially) the Sikhs played well with India’s majority Hindu polity.131 This doubtlessly helped curtail the popularity of an anti-government ideology like Naxalism. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the aggressive response to each of these movements presented a daunting 128 Wolpert, 425-426. 129 Ibid., 416-418. 130 Ibid., 423-425. 131 Ibid., 418. 42 challenge to any other would-be troublemakers. As historian Stanley Wolpert notes, “The stunning, shocking violence of Operation Bluestar served to put every minority in India on immediate notice of just how dangerous continued opposition to Delhi could be.”132 The Naxalites could certainly be included as one of these minority groups. As we shall see, however, the most potent enemy of Naxalism in this period was the internal disarray of the movement itself. C. INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NAXALITE INSURGENCY 1. Organization and Leadership Following the death of Charu Mazumdar in 1972, the Naxalites underwent a process of fragmentation that severely crippled the movement over the ensuing decades. Though their total numbers stayed relatively steady, with most estimates in the neighborhood of 15,000 activists nationwide, the leadership was increasingly driven by ideological and operational differences of opinion.133 While the failures of the previous period were the immediate catalyst for this phenomenon, the movement had displayed factionalist tendencies almost from its inception. At the organizational meetings of the AICCCR in 1969, two groups parted ways with the nascent CPI-(ML) from the outset. The first of these was the Andhra faction of Naxalites under the leadership of Nagi Reddy. Reddy differed with Mazumdar’s formulations on a number of points, most crucially the blanket ban on elections and the single-minded emphasis on the annihilation strategy at the expense of economic struggles and mass organization.134 After being disaffiliated from the AICCCR, Reddy formed his own organization in 1969, the Andhra Pradesh Revolutionary Communist Committee (APRCC). While the APRCC was initially larger than the CPI-(ML), Reddy’s arrest in late 1969 severely curtailed its activities.135 In the 1970s, the APRCC broke up into a 132 Wolpert, 418. 133 New York Times, “Maoist Extremists Reappear in India,” October 12, 1980. 134 Dasgupta, The Naxalite Movement, 154-156. 135 Ibid., 34. 43 number of smaller organizations, the two most significant of which were the Unity Center of Communist Revolutionaries of India (UCCRI) led by Nagi Reddy himself and Chandra Pulla Reddy’s Revolutionary Communist Center (RCC).136 While both groups were marginally active in Andhra Pradesh through the 1970s, they underwent numerous splits themselves in the latter half of the decade. By 1990, these smaller groups had either withered to inconsequence or been absorbed by other Naxalite outfits. The other faction that split from the AICCCR in 1969 was known as Dakshin Desh. Its leaders, Amulya Sen and Kanai Chatterjee, also disagreed with Mazumdar over the necessity of mass organization and established their own group, initially based in West Bengal. With the government crackdowns of 1970-71, Dakshin Desh moved its operations to Bihar, changing its name to the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) in 1975.137 Though relatively small, the MCC remained a more or less coherent organization over the course of these two decades. The same could certainly not be said for Charu Mazumdar’s CPI-(ML). The party had always been a relatively fragile construct of disparate personalities and ideologies, but after the setbacks of 1971-1972, it underwent a dizzying process of fractionalization that resulted in the emergence of literally dozens of competing groups. As the smaller organizations were often short-lived and of little real significance in the future development of the movement, only the most important will be enumerated here. Following Mazumdar’s death in 1972, the CPI-(ML) split into two broad camps: those who supported his ideology, strategy, and tactics, and those who opposed them. The pro-Mazumdar camp was further divided in 1973, with Lin Biao’s fall from grace in the Chinese Communist Party. A source of great inspiration for Mazumdar’s ideology, his disavowal by the Chinese generated contentious ideological debate within this branch of Naxalism.138 The pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction, a distinct minority, regrouped in West Bengal under the leadership of Mahadev Mukherjee.139 The pro-Mazumdar/anti- 136 Banerjee, 166, 298. 137 Prakash Singh, 115-116. 138 Banerjee, 246. 139 Ghosh, 175-177. 44 Lin Biao faction emerged in Bihar as CPI-(ML) Liberation, and in Andhra Pradesh as the Central Organizing Committee CPI-(ML), or COC-(ML).140 The COC-(ML) would itself split in 1977, with one faction, led by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, reestablishing itself in 1980 as CPI-(ML) People’s War Group, or PWG, in Andhra Pradesh.141 Among the anti-Mazumdar camp, the shakeout in this period was somewhat less confusing. The largest group emerged under the leadership of Satyanarayan Singh, the erstwhile Secretary of the CPI-(ML)’s Bihar State Committee. Singh had fallen out with Mazumdar in late 1971 over the latter’s authoritarian tendencies and seemingly suicidal tactical injunctions. In November of that year, Singh and a number of similarly disenchanted leaders formed a parallel leadership and actually expelled Mazumdar from his own party.142 Though most of the Naxalite rank-and-file did not initially accept this, Singh attracted a sizeable following after Mazumdar’s passing. His organization, known as CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh, was the largest and most influential of the post-Mazumdar Naxalite groups in the 1970s.143 The only other sizeable anti-Mazumdar group to emerge was Bihar’s CPI-(ML) Unity Committee, led by Khokan Mazumdar (no relation to Charu). In 1982, this group merged with the Bihar faction of the COC-(ML) to form the CPI-(ML) Party Unity, with Naveen Prasad as its new leader.144 While the proliferation of groups in this period might give an impression of vitality, the splintering of the movement was actually indicative of a great deal of uncertainty and acrimony in the ranks. While all still agreed on the need for a Maoist\u0002inspired political revolution in the country, Mazumdar’s death and the fallout from the failures of the 1965-1972 period had left the Naxalites confused and quarrelsome, on issues both practical and ideological. Cries of ‘revisionism’ by one group were answered with counteraccusations of ‘left-adventurism’ from another. The resultant infighting left 140 Prakash Singh, 156; Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 22. 141 Prakash Singh, 130. 142 Ghosh, 139-144, 151. 143 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 10. 144 Prakash Singh, 159-160. 45 the cadres demoralized and the leadership even more hopelessly divided.145 Perhaps no issue generated more contention than the most appropriate strategy to pursue in the post\u0002Mazumdar era. 2. Strategy and Tactics Following the security crackdowns in 1971-72, most of the Naxalite groups initially continued to advocate a violent strategy. With the memories of government repression fresh in their minds, this was not altogether surprising – most of their leaders continued to languish in prison, often under harsh conditions. Dakshin Desh and the pro\u0002Lin Biao faction in West Bengal were particularly vociferous in their agitation for a continuation of the annihilation policy. The other groups placed more rhetorical emphasis on building up mass organizations, but they too were initially unwilling to forswear armed struggle against the hated oppressors.146 However, with the end of the Emergency and the rise of the first Janata government, a more moderate position began to emerge within a key segment of the Naxalite movement. The CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh was the first major organization to change tack. Negotiating with Janata politicians from his jail cell after the 1977 elections, Singh’s aversion to electoral politics and compromise with the state softened. In a surprise move, he released a press statement in April 1977 expressing his “critical support” for the new Janata government and vowing that his group would participate in the assembly elections of June of that year.147 The formerly staunch advocate of the annihilation strategy went so far as to announce, “We wish to state categorically here that violence is not our ideology. Our ideology is Marxism-Leninism.”148 Though he justified this ideological reversal on the grounds that it would secure the release of political prisoners and enable the Maoists to present their platform to more of the population than ever before, his move 145 Jawaid, 94-95. 146 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 11. 147 Ibid., 14. 148 Prakash Singh, 121-122. 46 was viewed as treason by the rest of the movement.149 However, when the Janata government delivered on its promises of clemency and one of Singh’s candidates was actually elected in West Bengal (Santosh Rana, formerly the leader of the Midnapur uprising), his approach was vindicated in the eyes of many Naxalites. Even such old\u0002school stalwarts as Kanu Sanyal and Ashim Chatterjee eventually gave Singh’s strategy their grudging endorsement.150 Throughout the rest of the 1970s and 80s, CPI-(ML) Liberation and various lesser organizations followed the CPI-(ML) S.N. Singh’s lead and slowly moderated their stance. To be sure, it took time for the incidences of violence to diminish, and many of these groups stressed that they still retained the option of armed revolution.151 Nevertheless, they increasingly normalized their activities, allying themselves with leftist political parties and contesting elections at the state level through front organizations in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal.152 For other groups, however, rapprochement with any government forces, whatever their political stripes, remained anathema. The MCC, COC-(ML), and CPI-(ML) Unity Committee acknowledged the need for a greater emphasis on mass organization, but only in support of armed agrarian revolution.153 The latter two organizations splintered in the late 1970s, but their descendants carried on their two-pronged strategy of mass mobilization and violent opposition in the subsequent decade. Both the PWG and Party Unity continued the killing of jotedars and other class enemies, but not as single-mindedly as the CPI-(ML) had in the past. They also established aboveground organizations to agitate for land reform and minimum wages, and began setting up parallel administrations to dispense justice and other government functions that were lacking in the remote areas where they operated.154 Interestingly, the PWG was also able to attract some support by waging a 149 Dasgupta, “The Naxalite Movement: An Epilogue,” 14-15. 150 Prakash Singh, 123. 151 Ibid., 158. 152 Tilak, 19-20; Prakash Singh, 123. 153 Prakash Singh, 123. 154 Ibid., 133-134. 47 campaign against social vice in the villages, which included crusades against drunkenness, gambling, and prostitution.155 Despite their avowed commitment to a similarly multi-pronged approach, the MCC was generally less successful in these secondary endeavors. During the 1980s, the group was best known for the gruesome nature of its continuing annihilations, still directed primarily at upper caste landlords.156 At the tactical level, those groups espousing violence began implementing more realistic methods in their continued pursuit of armed revolution. Discarding the Charuist aversion to modern weaponry, most actively encouraged the capture of guns from jotedars and police.157 While this slowly improved the Naxalites’ firepower, their operations remained dominated by small squad-level actions, and were generally unsophisticated in terms of their planning and execution. In the late 1980s, the PWG did receive some training from LTTE rebels in more advanced tactics, including the use of explosives. This enabled them to successfully carry out a land-mine attack against police forces in 1989, providing a deadly portent of things to come.158 For the most part, however, major improvements in the Maoists’ operational capabilities would not come until well into the next decade. 3. Naxalite Activity As fundamental as it was, the split between those groups that followed the Singh line of political normalization and those that continued with the strategy of violence was just one of a host of divisions that spread like a cancer through the movement. Even groups on the same side of the strategic divide remained pitted against one another over issues of personality or ideology, and fratricide was not uncommon.159 In this contentious environment, there was little hope of consolidation or cooperation. Split as 155 Prakash Singh, 137-138. 156 Ibid., 151-153. 157 Ibid., 136 , 151. 158 Ibid., 140-141. 159 Ibid., 155. 48 they were into numerous smaller groupings, the Naxalites’ activity in this period was generally circumscribed and remained restricted to a few small geographic areas. Throughout the early and mid-1970s, a combination of effective security efforts and the imprisonment of most of the leadership put a stop to almost all violent Naxalite activity. Indeed, brief periods of unrest were recorded in only two places: northern West Bengal and Bhojpur district in Bihar. The agitation in West Bengal erupted in 1973, led by the pro-Mazumdar/pro-Lin Biao faction of Mahadev Mukherjee. For about a year, actions against police forces resulted in several dozen deaths and the seizure of a similar number of firearms, but the uprising fizzled with Mukherjee’s arrest towards the end of 1974.160 The activity in Bhojpur was slightly longer lived, lasting from 1972-1977, and was led by CPI-(ML) Liberation. Still committed to violent revolution at this stage, the group carried out a number of annihilations against class enemies with the support of local tribes. Still, the uprising was a small-scale affair, accounting for only around ninety deaths over the entire five-year period, with its longevity due more to the state government’s anemic response than the actual strength of the insurgency. Like its counterpart in West Bengal, it was put down relatively easily with the introduction of more aggressive security measures, this time from the center.161 The late 1970s witnessed the dramatic announcements of Satyanarayan Singh and the political normalization of a number of Naxalite groups. Though gradual, this proved to be an enduring phenomenon, and the CPI-(ML) S.N.Singh and its followers largely retreated from violent activities. Though still active politically, their strategic course change effectively removed them from the Naxalite fold by the early 1980s, at least for the purposes of this thesis. As for the more recalcitrant Maoists, two dozen smaller groups remained minimally active in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and a number of southern states.162 Between them all, however, they accounted for only a handful of incidents and even fewer deaths. Throughout the 1980s, the only groups of 160 Ghosh, 175-177. 161 Prakash Singh, 117-119. 162 Ibid., 124. 49 any real significance were the PWG in Andhra Pradesh, and what the Indian security official Prakash Singh dubbed the ‘New Left’ in Bihar.163 Formed in April 1980 by Kandapalli Seetharamaiah, the PWG quickly became the most powerful Naxalite organization in the country. Though this latter fact was admittedly not much of a boast during this period, they were a disruptive influence in their primary area of operations, the perennially restive and underdeveloped Telangana region.164 While the group did engage in rudimentary social projects and set up a number of peasant organizations to help mobilize the masses in pursuit of economic goals, Seetharamaiah was also a firm believer in Mazumdar’s annihilation strategy. As Table 1 shows, the group grew increasingly violent under his leadership, with attacks on jotedars, police, and police informants.165 Though still relatively contained by the end of the 1980s, the PWG was already demonstrating the bloody ruthlessness that would distinguish it in later decades. The ‘New Left’ in Bihar emerged at roughly the same time as the PWG. Comprised of the MCC, Party Unity, and CPI-(ML) Liberation, the title may give a misleading impression of cooperation amongst the groups. In reality, they fought each other nearly as often as they engaged ‘class enemies,’ often in petty squabbles over turf or ideological nuances. 163 Prakash Singh, 124. 164 Ibid., 129-141. 165 Ibid., 140 YEAR INCIDENTS KILLED 1981 53 10 1982 98 18 1983 172 17 1984 306 30 1985 308 30 1986 161 25 1987 252 63 1988 453 59 1989 456 84 1990 735 94 Table 1. Naxalite Violence in Andhra Pradesh 50 Nevertheless, they too managed to make an impact at the state level. Like Telangana, Bihar remained beyond the reach of many of the government’s reform initiatives, and pockets of rural unrest continued to provide havens for Naxalite cadres.166 Though Liberation was the largest of the three groups, its gradual embrace of electoral politics over the course of the decade made it the least violently active. It maintained an armed wing into the 1990s, but its aboveground political organization, the Indian People’s Front, increasingly supplanted the influence of its more belligerent cadres.167 The faction favoring normalization gained dominance in 1992, and Liberation thereafter functioned primarily as an aboveground outfit, focused almost exclusively on peaceful mass organization.168 In a telling signal of the extent of their moderation, its leaders even called for rapprochement with the formerly despised CPI and CPI-(M), in an effort to build a more coordinated leftist political front.169 By contrast, the MCC and Party Unity remained exclusively committed to armed revolution. Mass organization was desirable, but in the context of a burgeoning caste conflict in the state during this period, often difficult to mobilize along exclusively class lines. Instead, the annihilation strategy was pursued with a decidedly grisly purpose, particularly by the MCC. In most cases, upper caste jotedars and their families were the primary targets but, with the conflation of caste and class conflicts in the state, the sadistic nature of the killings failed to generate the same backlash that had occurred previously. As a result, both the MCC and Party Unity were able to carve out small areas of influence in Bihar over the latter half of the 1980s.170 As in Andhra Pradesh, however, this level of activity remained a far cry from that of 1967-1972. 166 Prakash Singh, 148-160. 167 Tilak, 19. 168 Prakash Singh, 158. 169 Tilak, 20. 170 Prakash Singh, 148-156, 159-160. 51 D. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 1. Center Responses From the halls of power in New Delhi, Naxalism appeared to be a spent force after 1972. With the center caught up in the drama of systemic political change and the growth of ethnic secessionist movements over these two decades, relatively scant attention was paid to the fractured and localized Maoist movement in the country. Nevertheless, as alluded in Section 3.2, developments at the national level did have an impact on the Naxalites. With the INC’s turn to a more populist platform, new rural development and land reform initiatives effectively undercut the movement’s base of support. With rural inequality receding rather than growing, the more militant cadres had a much harder time finding sympathetic base areas from which to operate. Even for those sections of the movement that drifted in a more moderate direction, the government’s schemes were successful in stealing their rhetorical thunder and foiling most attempts at mass organization; Naxalite candidates did not generally have much success at the polls, Santosh Rana’s success notwithstanding.171 While these developments posed indirect problems for the Naxalites, a much more immediate challenge emerged with the imposition of the Emergency in 1975. Though not primarily directed at the Naxalites, the resultant political and security crackdowns hit the movement hard. Like most other opposition groups, all Naxalite organizations were banned and scores of leaders and party activists rearrested under the newly instituted Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).172 Among them were some of the Maoists’ most effective organizers, including Kanu Sanyal, Ashim Chatterjee, and Satyanarayan Singh. Moreover, the security forces were given wide latitude in dealing with whatever opposition escaped the prison cell. Frequently, this entailed direct action like that of ‘Operation Thunder,’ which crushed the long-simmering 171 Prakash Singh, 211-212. 172 Banerjee, 297. 52 unrest in Bhojpur with combined operations by the military and Central Reserve Police forces in 1977.173 Already in tatters after Mazumdar’s death, the Naxalite movement was nearly destroyed by the center’s expanded powers during the Emergency.174 Ironically, it was also New Delhi that granted it a new lease on life. The Janata government’s promises to undo the excesses of the Emergency resulted in the release of hundreds of Naxalite prisoners all across the country in 1977 and 1978, the legalization of most of their organizations, and the easing of pressure by government security forces.175 While this ultimately had the effect of moderating several factions and co\u0002opting them into the political process, it also freed the more hard-core cadres to resume their subversive activities. Though the INC returned to power in New Delhi in 1980, it did not resume its previous activities against the Naxalites. In part, this was due to the still extremely weak state of the movement. More importantly, however, the government already had its hands full with the growing unrest in Punjab and the Northeast. Nevertheless, the center’s security initiatives with respect to these other regions reverberated among the Naxalites. The extremely aggressive response to these insurgencies likely helped convince the more moderate Maoists that the path of armed rebellion was untenable and provided some deterrent effect even to their more violent-minded brethren. Whatever the case, Naxalite violence remained at a sufficiently low ebb through the 1980s to permit the central government to largely dismiss it as a local law and order problem. The same could not necessarily be said for those states that were more directly affected. 2. State Responses As the birthplace of Naxalism, West Bengal had the longest history in dealing with the insurgency. While effective policing put down the 1973-74 uprising of Mahadev Mukherjee’s faction, rural unrest continued to simmer under a series of Congress administrations. When a Left Front coalition government returned to power in 1977, 173 Prakash Singh, 119. 174 Mehra, 51-52. 175 Prakash Singh, 122; Tilak, 12. 53 however, the situation changed dramatically. Led by the CPI-(M), the new administration proved much more competent and enduring than its predecessors. Under its direction, West Bengal instituted a series of land redistribution and rural development initiatives that proved remarkably successful. One of these was ‘Operation Barga,’ which established strict ceilings on total landholdings by individuals and granted inheritable ownership rights to tenant farmers and sharecroppers.176 Unencumbered by the political compromises, conflicts of interest, and enforcement issues that so often plagued center\u0002led efforts, these state-level reforms removed the Maoists’ raison d’etre in a few short years. By the early 1980s, Naxalism had ceased to be a force of any consequence in the state.177 Though not as successful as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh was able to mount an intermittently effective counter to its Naxalite problem. The TDP, which came to power in 1983, initially pursued a policy of appeasement with the PWG in an effort to lure them to peace talks. When it became clear that the group had no intention of negotiating in good faith (and had, in fact, used the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen their positions), the state’s Chief Minister, N.T. Rama Rao, adopted a hard line against the Naxalites.178 Rao authorized aggressive policing measures against PWG cadres and oversaw the formation of the Greyhounds, the state’s elite anti-Naxal police unit, in the late 1980s.179 Though he supported aggressive security measures, Rao did not neglect the rural development initiatives that had proved so successful in West Bengal. Land reform and rural employment initiatives were implemented with moderate success, but a lack of government infrastructure in remoter parts of the state made their implementation there difficult.180 In 1989, the INC returned to power in state elections, but initially made the same early mistakes as the TDP. The new Chief Minister, Chenna Reddy, tried to 176 Prakash Singh, 179. 177 Mehra, 56; Prakash Singh, 236. 178 Prakash Singh, 139. 179 Andhra Pradesh State Police, “Units: Greyhounds,” http://www.apstatepolice.org/AboutUs/units/units_greyhounds.htm (accessed February 4, 2008). 180 K.C. Suri, “Telugu Desam Party,” in India’s Political Parties, ed. Peter Ronald DeSouza and E. Sridharan (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc, 2006), 294-295. 54 appease the PWG in a vain attempt to lure them into the mainstream, releasing several hundred Naxalite prisoners rounded up under the previous administration.181 When this approach failed again, Reddy reverted to Rao’s combination of tough policing and socio\u0002economic development. Despite these ups and downs, the state was relatively successful in confining the PWG to the Telangana region and a few neighboring districts throughout the 1980s. By contrast, the containment of the MCC and Party Unity in Bihar had little to do with the state government. The Janata Party captured control of the state briefly, from 1977 to 1980, but the remainder of this period was dominated by INC administrations. In reality, however, it scarcely mattered who controlled the government. Corruption, cronyism, and maladministration took root in Bihar in the 1970s and continued to flourish through the 1980s.182 Unable to mount effective security or development initiatives of any kind, the government essentially left the rural parts of the state to their own devices, providing space for the embers of Naxalism to smolder. While the growth of caste conflict in the state, as well as internecine fighting between the MCC and PU, were enough to keep the Naxalites more or less in check during these decades, the state’s appallingly poor governance would become an issue in the future resurgence of Naxalism. E. CONCLUSION The Fragmentary Period was a prolonged low point in the history of Naxalism in India. After its brief but significant surge from 1967 to 1972, the movement underwent a period of stagnation and decay that lasted nearly two decades and effectively removed it from the public consciousness. Though not as captivating a story as the vitality of the previous period, the impotence of the movement and its singular inability to gain traction during these years are still worthy of examination. 181 Sanjoy Hazarika, “Indian Rebel Group is Linked to Train Attack,” New York Times, October 21, 1990. 182 Prakash Singh, 148-150. 55 The most obvious reason for the failure of Naxalism in this period was its own organizational weakness. Fractured into dozens of smaller, competing factions, it was too dispersed and fragmented to mount any kind of meaningful challenge to the forces of the Indian state. In large part, this was a failure of leadership. Consumed by their personal egos, strategic and tactical differences, and ideological arguments incomprehensible to any but the most dogmatic Marxists, the heads of the various Naxalite organizations were utterly incapable of resolving their disputes and coordinating the activities of their disparate groups. As a consequence, a large portion of the movement effectively abandoned the revolutionary line, and those that remained were confined to a few small pockets of activity in the hinterlands. With the structure of the movement in such a state, its success would have been unlikely in even a permissive security environment. As it turned out, the security environment was decidedly unfavorable. The imposition of the Emergency in the 1970s granted the state a great deal of leeway in dealing with opposition movements, and it used them to devastating affect against the already fragmented Naxalites. Indeed, the movement was very nearly destroyed by policing actions like Operation Thunder and the imprisonment of hundreds, if not thousands of its activists. The situation in the 1980s was hardly any better. Though New Delhi’s aggressive reactions to the various secessionist uprisings in the country were not directed against the Maoists, they still provided a powerful deterrent effect. Lastly, the social, economic, and political conditions in the country were not conducive to the spread of Naxalite ideology. Political changes at the systemic level gave a new voice to groups the Maoists traditionally relied on for support, making the government more responsive to their needs. As a result, land reforms and rural development became a priority at both the state and national levels. While these programs were not always perfectly implemented, poverty rates did decline, and real and perceived inequity were alleviated to some degree. These issues had been drivers of rural unrest in the previous period, and the government’s efforts to address them proved generally successful in keeping the countryside peaceful during these decades. 56 To most observers in 1991, the Naxalist threat appeared to be over. The movement had been wiped out in the state of its birth, sizeable numbers of its former adherents were embracing electoral democracy, and, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Communism was being discredited around the world. In isolated pockets of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, however, the embers of the Maoist revolution continued to smolder. In places the rural reforms had scarcely reached, the People’s War Group, Maoist Communist Center, and Party Unity continued to cling to existence, waiting for the right moment to reignite the fire of Naxalbari. 57 IV. THE RECONSOLIDATION PERIOD (1991-PRESENT) A. INTRODUCTION With an analysis of the first two periods of Naxalite activity complete, this chapter now turns to the most recent iteration of Maoist violence in India. In an examination of the historical evolution of Naxalism, the period from 1991 to the present is certainly the most paradoxical. In the course of little more than 17 years, India has transformed from a large, but isolated and relatively weak state, to one of the central players in the emerging geopolitical order. Its macroeconomic growth is astounding, second only to China in the developing world, and its diplomatic clout on the world stage has increased commensurately. To many outside observers, India looks to be successfully integrating itself into the modern world. And yet, in those same 17 years, an archaic Communist ideology, rejected even in the place of its birth, was also in the ascendancy. Written off by most security analysts in the ashes of the Fragmentary Period from 1972-1991, Naxalism staged a spectacular comeback in the following decades, growing in scope, breadth, and violence. By 2006, its impact was so great that Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was forced to declare, “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the problem of Naxalism is the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”183 This is certainly a startling announcement for a nation that suffered through the chaos of Partition, witnessed the violence of a Sikh rebellion in the Punjab, and is still confronted by the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, various insurgencies in the Northeast, fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and continuing Hindu-Muslim communal strife. What explains Naxalism’s phoenix-like rebirth in a period that has witnessed such phenomenal growth and national development? 183 Manmohan Singh, “Prime Minister’s Speech to the 2nd Meeting of the Standing Committee of Chief Ministers on Naxalism,” 13 April 2006, Government of India Press Information Bureau, http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=17128, (accessed August 10, 2007). 58 B. HISTORICAL CONTEXT 1. Political Developments Since 1991, the most striking development in Indian politics has been the emergence of a truly multi-polar power structure. The declining hegemony of the INC (discussed in the previous chapter) dramatically accelerated during the 1990s, fuelled by the emergence of the “Three M’s” on the political scene: Mandir, Mandal, and Market Reforms.184 In 1998, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition unseated the previous INC administration and inaugurated the longest period of uninterrupted rule by a non\u0002Congress party since independence. Though the INC returned to power in 2004, the BJP’s ascendancy in the 1990s definitively marked the end of one-party dominance in India, resulting in a more complex and contentious political setting than at any other time in the nation’s history. Minority governments and coalition politics are now the order of the day, severely restricting New Delhi’s freedom of action in addressing many pressing issues. In many ways, this increasing gridlock at the national level is reflected in interactions between the central government and those of the states. India’s political structure is distinctly federal, with the 28 state and 7 union territory governments retaining high levels of autonomy from New Delhi, barring the infrequent imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ from the center. This is particularly true with respect to internal security, an area in which the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India grants the individual states great authority and latitude.185 Such a division of powers presents obvious problems for policy coordination, especially when different parties control the various levels of government. This situation was not much of an issue in earlier decades, 184 ‘Mandir’ refers to Hindu Nationalism, ‘Mandal’ to the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report on the status of backward castes, and ‘Market Reforms’ to the economic reforms inaugurated in 1991. For an excellent exposition of these phenomena and their impact on Indian politics, see: Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar, “Party System and Electoral Politics in the Indian States, 1952- 2002: From Hegemony to Convergence,” in India’s Political Parties, ed.

He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

Today's spy doesn't wear a trench coat or sneak across borders — they slip into servers. A few lines of malicious code, a cleverly worded phishing email, and one careless click are enough to open a backdoor into power grids, defence networks, or corporate vaults. There's no gunfire, no alarm — just a silent invasion across cyberspace.Modern espionage no longer focuses on state secrets alone. It can paralyse ports, jam telecoms, empty bank accounts, and hold critical infrastructure hostage, all from thousands of miles away. Many of these attacks aren't random pranks but well-coordinated operations by advanced persistent threats (APTs) — hacker groups often backed by nation-states who monitor systems for months and even years — or by ‘Spider gangs', the global cybercrime cartels who chase profit, not politics.In Feb 2025, a hacker collective calling itself ‘Keymous+' targeted Gujarat's civic systems, according to FalconFeeds.io, a threat actor repository. The group overwhelmed the websites of Ahmedabad and Surat municipal corporations with fake web traffic in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that crashed the portals for hours. Analysts found that Keymous+ boasted of 700 global attacks in 2025, 27.6% of which were govt entities while the rest ranged from finance and telecom to education. **You Can Also Check: [Ahmedabad AQI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-aqi-level-air-quality-index-today/3252) \\| [Weather in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-weather-forecast-today/380001) \\| [Gold Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/gold-rates-today/gold-price-in-ahemadabad) \\| [Silver Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/silver-rates-today/silver-price-in-ahemadabad)** But others aimed far deeper. In 2020, RedEcho, a group suspected to be backed by a nation-state, infiltrated India's power grid. They did not cause blackouts, but mapped out critical systems like the regional and state load despatch centres (RLDCs and SLDCs) — the nerve centres managing electricity supply — in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and several northern states. Cybersecurity experts at Recorded Future's Insikt group believe the hackers were creating digital \"backdoors\" — hidden entry points — \"to cause potential blackouts in the future\".Then came, TAG-38, another elite adversary sponsored by an enemy nation. Between Sep 2021 and March 2022, \"they targeted at least seven SLDCs in northern and western India, including areas near sensitive border zones\", states the Inskit group report. They cleverly hid their tracks by using hacked DVRs and IP cameras in Taiwan and South Korea to control their attacks remotely. These groups use advanced tools like ShadowPad (a modular malware that can be customised for different attacks) and remote access trojan (RAT) software that lets hackers control a computer from afar. They often get in through spear phishing — tricking someone into clicking a fake email link — or by exploiting weak spots in websites.India also faces threats from APT36 known as ‘Transparent Tribe', another group backed by an enemy nation and active since 2013. In March and April 2025, they disguised malware as updates on the ‘Pahalgam terror attack' to trick officials into opening infected files. They even created fake ministry of defence websites and used a sneaky trick called ClickFix, where malicious code is copied from a user's clipboard without them knowing.Meanwhile, SideCopy, another group, used fake social media profiles and phishing emails to target India's defence personnel. And APT41, also backed by an enemy nation, has been spying on India's healthcare and tech sectors, while also [hacking](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hacking) for money, even manipulating virtual currencies in online games.To combat such threats, Gujarat's science and technology department issued a circular this year, urging all govt employees to strengthen cyber hygiene. \"Do not share official photos or documents online, and never link work emails to personal apps,\" warned principal secretary Mona Kandhar. Officials were reminded that one careless click can compromise an entire department.The war is invisible, but it is already here. Every click, download, or forwarded file could be the entry point for a breach waiting to happen.

    "full_text": "### Global Power Grid Failure: The Ultimate Test of a Disaster Economy ## The Unthinkable Scenario: A Worldwide Blackout Imagine waking up one morning to find every screen dark, every city silent, and every connection gone. No internet, no phone signal, no electricity — anywhere. Airports grounded. Hospitals dark. Satellites flickering. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the nightmare scenario energy planners call a \\*\\* [global grid failure](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=global+grid+failure&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549)\\*\\*. While localized outages are common, a systemic, cross-continental blackout would be unlike anything humanity has faced. It would disrupt water systems, banking, logistics, and communications in a single, cascading event. Within days, cities would struggle for food, fuel, and medical supplies. Within weeks, society would test the limits of order and survival. As impossible as it sounds, the risk isn’t zero. In an era of cyberwarfare, extreme [solar storms](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=solar+storms+electrical+grid&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), and geopolitical instability, experts are quietly asking a chilling question: What if the grid we depend on — globally — simply went dark? ## How the Power Grid Became the World’s Weakest Link The global electrical system was never designed as one coherent network. It’s a loose patchwork of regional grids — the U.S. Eastern, Western, and ERCOT systems, the European [ENTSO-E network](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=ENTSO-E+network&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), and massive interconnections across Asia. Each operates independently yet relies on the same fragile foundations: transmission lines, transformers, substations, and digital control systems. The more connected the world becomes, the more interdependent and vulnerable these systems grow. A cyberattack on one nation’s control nodes, a geomagnetic storm from the sun, or a chain-reaction equipment failure could disable multiple regions simultaneously. In the 21st century, electricity isn’t just energy — it’s existence. Food, transportation, defense, and finance all depend on uninterrupted power. The more sophisticated the grid, the more catastrophic its absence becomes. ## How a Global Grid Failure Could Happen Energy researchers identify three primary pathways for a worldwide electrical collapse: 1. **Cyberattack on control infrastructure:** The world’s grids are managed by industrial control systems (ICS) and [SCADA software](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=define+SCADA+software&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) — often decades old, insecure, and connected to the internet. Coordinated malware could disable protective relays and trip breakers across continents in seconds. 2. **Solar storm or electromagnetic pulse (EMP):** A strong coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun could induce geomagnetic currents that burn out transformers globally. The [1859 Carrington Event](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=1859+Carrington+Event&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) produced auroras as far south as Cuba — today, that same intensity could cripple satellites and transmission lines for years. 3. **Systemic equipment collapse:** With aging infrastructure, spare parts like high-voltage transformers take months to replace. A simultaneous series of failures across continents could outstrip manufacturing capacity and delay recovery indefinitely. Each scenario is improbable on its own — but together, they represent a plausible convergence risk in an age of climate stress, cyber conflict, and geopolitical fragmentation. ## The Domino Effect: 72 Hours to Chaos Most people underestimate how fast modern life unravels when electricity stops. Within hours, pumps at gas stations, water treatment plants, and supermarkets cease functioning. Hospitals switch to limited backup power. ATMs and credit systems go offline, halting commerce. By the third day, refrigerated food spoils, cell towers die, and transportation grinds to a halt. In dense urban areas, law enforcement becomes overwhelmed as communications fail and panic spreads. PowerPlantMaps’ research into past blackouts — from Texas 2021 to India’s 2012 outage affecting 620 million people — shows that even regional failures can paralyze entire economies. A global outage would multiply those effects a thousandfold. ## The Disaster Industrial Complex: Who Profits When the Lights Go Out? Ironically, every blackout fuels a surge of economic activity. Investors, insurers, and infrastructure firms stand ready to profit from reconstruction. Bloomberg estimates that U.S. disaster-related spending now exceeds \\*\\*$1 trillion annually\\*\\*, much of it directed toward energy restoration and backup systems. In this “ [disaster industrial complex](https://www.disasterreliefmaps.com/2025/10/the-rise-of-americas-disaster-economy.html),” every storm, fire, or grid failure becomes an opportunity — a market built on resilience, but driven by collapse. A global power failure would ignite the largest mobilization of resources in human history: satellite launches, microgrid installations, generator sales, and the reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Companies that build batteries, data centers, and private [microgrids](https://blog.solarenergymaps.com/2025/10/the-rise-of-microgrids-and-energy.html) could emerge as the next trillion-dollar winners. The question isn’t whether there will be profits — but who can survive long enough to earn them. ## What Would You Do Without Power? Preparedness experts categorize survival into five pillars: \\*\\*water, food, heat, communication, and mobility.\\*\\* A global outage would test all five simultaneously. - **Water:** Without electricity, municipal pumping stations fail. Gravity-fed systems run dry within days. Households would need stored water or filtration devices. - **Food:** Refrigeration halts and grocery supply chains collapse. Non-perishable goods and local agriculture become survival essentials. - **Heat and cooling:** In extreme climates, lack of HVAC can turn deadly within hours. Wood, propane, and solar heating become vital. - **Communication:** With no cellular or internet networks, shortwave and ham radios become the only long-range communication tools. - **Mobility:** Electric vehicles, gas pumps, and traffic systems stop. Bicycles and manually operated transport regain value. In essence, a total grid failure would revert modern life to the pre-industrial age — but with 8 billion people unprepared to live that way. ## Mapping the Impact: Where Blackouts Hit Hardest At [PowerPlantMaps.com](https://www.powerplantmaps.com), we use historical outage data to identify regions most vulnerable to cascading grid failures. The top risk clusters include: - **[U.S. Gulf Coast](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=US+Gulf+Coast+power+grid+resilience&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549):** Storm-driven outages and coastal grid fragility. - **Europe’s Rhine Corridor:** Flood-induced substation failures. - **South and East Asia:** Overloaded networks from rapid urbanization. - **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Chronic underinvestment and low redundancy. Visualizing these data layers reveals a pattern: the world’s most industrialized zones are also its most grid-dependent. The more developed the region, the steeper the fall when power vanishes. ## The Hidden Players of the Global Grid Few realize that a handful of corporations control the flow of global electricity hardware: [Siemens](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Siemens+electrical+grid+equipment&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), ABB, Hitachi Energy, General Electric, and Schneider Electric manufacture most of the world’s high-voltage equipment. The supply chains for transformers, capacitors, and relays are so concentrated that a single global event could wipe out production capacity. In that case, rebuilding the world’s grid wouldn’t take months — it could take decades. This concentration of control turns grid resilience into both an engineering and geopolitical issue. ## The Rise of Microgrids and Energy Islands To prepare for the unthinkable, nations and cities are experimenting with \\*\\*microgrids\\*\\* — small, self-sufficient energy networks capable of operating independently from the main grid. Universities, hospitals, military bases, and even island nations are building localized systems powered by solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage. During a global grid crisis, these microgrids could form the backbone of recovery. They represent both a technological safeguard and a commercial gold rush: a new frontier in decentralized energy economics. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates over $50 billion in microgrid investment pipelines through 2030. The disaster industrial complex is already betting that the next generation of “resilience infrastructure” will come from these autonomous systems. ## Cybersecurity: The Invisible Battlefield In a hyperconnected world, power grids are no longer physical assets alone — they’re digital battlegrounds. State-sponsored hackers have targeted energy systems from Ukraine to the U.S. since 2015. A coordinated global cyberstrike could compromise grid stability faster than any storm. Governments and utilities now spend billions annually on cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and backup control centers. Yet even the most secure systems remain vulnerable to insider error, outdated software, and the sheer complexity of interconnected networks. In a global failure scenario, cyber resilience would be as important as physical repair. ## Rebuilding After the Global Blackout If a global power failure occurred, recovery would be uneven. Wealthier nations with manufacturing capacity could restore power in months, while others might remain dark for years. The United Nations and World Bank have already modeled post-catastrophe frameworks for global energy recovery — including emergency grids powered by floating nuclear reactors, airborne solar drones, and modular hydro plants. A global blackout could paradoxically accelerate renewable adoption as nations rebuild from scratch using distributed systems instead of centralized grids. In other words, from collapse could come reinvention — if humanity learns the right lessons. ## Personal and Community Resilience For individuals, preparedness is no longer paranoia; it’s prudence. A small investment in off-grid capacity — solar panels, portable batteries, [manual tools](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=manual+tools+survival&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) — can mean survival in prolonged outages. Communities can organize local power cooperatives, stockpile resources, and create neighborhood emergency protocols. On a larger scale, mapping and data transparency are essential. PowerPlantMaps encourages citizens to document blackouts, share outage data, and contribute to public resilience mapping. Knowledge is the first step toward preparedness. ## The Global Wake-Up Call A global grid failure may seem unlikely, but every regional blackout, cyber breach, or solar flare is a warning sign. Humanity’s greatest invention — the electric grid — is also its Achilles’ heel. The \\*\\*disaster industrial complex\\*\\* profits from repair, but resilience demands prevention. The choice facing governments and corporations is clear: invest now in modernization, or pay exponentially later in reconstruction. The world’s survival isn’t about avoiding the dark — it’s about learning how to rebuild the light.

This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment. In this challenging and uncertain environment, we have downgraded our growth projections. We are now forecasting that global growth will decline from 3.3% in 2024 to a modest 2.9% in 2025 and in 2026. Weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception. Lower growth and less trade will hit incomes and slow job growth. Although inflation has recently declined in most countries, service price inflation remains stubbornly sticky and goods price inflation has increased slightly in many countries due to rising food prices. Protectionism is adding to these inflationary pressures, and inflation expectations have risen substantially in several countries. And even though we are still forecasting that inflation will come down to central bank targets by 2026 in most countries, it will now take longer to reach those targets. In the countries more affected by tariffs, inflation might even rise first before coming down. Risks have risen significantly too. There is the risk that protectionism and trade policy uncertainty will increase even further and that additional trade barriers might be introduced. According to our simulations, additional tariffs would further reduce global growth prospects and fuel inflation, dampening global growth even more. Fiscal risks are also increasing. Public debt levels are already elevated in many advanced and emerging market economies and spending pressures are rising in areas such as defence, investing in the green transition and costs related to the ageing of our societies. Debt service costs are rising too, further increasing pressures on public finances. High debt levels and tighter financial conditions pose particular risks for developing countries, many of which have large debt refinancing needs in the near future. Historically elevated equity valuations also increase the vulnerability to negative shocks in financial markets. In this context, policy has a crucial role to play to tackle uncertainty and boost growth. First and foremost, it is essential to avoid further trade fragmentation and trade barriers. Agreements to ease trade tensions and lower tariffs and other trade barriers will be instrumental to revive growth and investment and avoid rising prices. This is by far the most important policy priority. Second, given the recent inflationary pressures, monetary policy should remain vigilant. Still, if trade tensions are not intensified and inflation expectations remain anchored, policy rates can be reduced if inflation is projected to decline or remain subdued. Third, restoring fiscal discipline is key for countries to avoid fiscal sustainability problems and build buffers for future shocks. Given high debt levels and tremendous spending pressures, countries should ensure 10  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 that public debt is, indeed, on a sustainable path. Clear and credible medium-term fiscal plans are needed to show how countries intend to address pressures on public finances. Thus, reducing non-essential or inefficient expenditures by undertaking periodic spending reviews, targeting of policies, as well as raising revenues by reforming tax systems or broadening tax bases, are key policy instruments to help ensure fiscal sustainability. Finally, boosting investment will be instrumental to revive our economies and improve public finances. As we demonstrate in our special chapter, investment has been too low since the global financial crisis. Sluggish investment has lowered growth, productivity, and living standards. Business investment has fallen not only due to uncertainty and weakened demand, but also due to structural factors. This includes declining competitive pressures and financing frictions that have become more evident as a higher share of investment has been devoted to intangible assets (such as software, R&D, etc). At the same time, housing investment has been too feeble to avoid a substantial decline in housing affordability in many countries. And public investment has also been too weak for too long in many economies. In this Outlook, we provide recommendations for countries to foster investment and growth, including reforms enhancing competition and cutting regulatory costs, increasing public investment in energy, digital and critical infrastructures, addressing skills shortages and skills mismatches, and speeding up construction permits and licenses, as well as easing zoning and planning restrictions and rental regulations, to spur housing supply. All in all, in the current context, governments should work together to tackle uncertainty and pursue reforms to foster growth and jobs. Trade agreements to resolve existing tensions and lower or eliminate barriers should be accompanied by more efforts to enhance multilateral cooperation. Governments also need to tackle domestic challenges to boost growth and durably raise living standards, by fostering business and public investment and by pursuing productivity-enhancing structural reforms to improve the competitiveness of their economies. Policy has a crucial role to play in these challenging and uncertain times. 3 June 2025 Álvaro Pereira OECD Chief Economist  11 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Introduction The global outlook is becoming increasingly challenging. Substantial increases in barriers to trade, tighter financial conditions, weaker business and consumer confidence and heightened policy uncertainty will all have marked adverse effects on growth prospects if they persist. Higher trade costs, especially in countries raising tariffs, will also push up inflation, although their impact will be offset partially by weaker commodity prices. Global GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and in 2026 (Table 1.1), on the technical assumption that tariff rates as of mid-May are sustained despite ongoing legal challenges. The slowdown is concentrated in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with China and other economies expected to see smaller downward adjustments. Growth through 2025 is expected to be especially weak, with global output rising by just over 2½ per cent over the year to the fourth quarter, and by only 1.1% in the United States. Global trade growth is likely to slow substantially over the next two years, after significant front-loading ahead of expected tariff increases, and uncertainty is expected to hold back business investment. Fiscal easing will provide support in a handful of economies notably in China and Germany, where higher defence and infrastructure spending in 2026 could generate a significant upturn, but policy is likely to be mildly restrictive in many other countries. Annual headline inflation in the G20 economies is collectively expected to moderate from 6.2% to 3.6% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026, but the United States is an important exception, with annual inflation expected to rise to just under 4% by the end of 2025 and remain above target in 2026. There are substantial risks to these projections, with the scale and duration of the expected downturn remaining highly uncertain. Further increases or swift changes in trade barriers, including through retaliatory actions, as well as more cautious behaviour by consumers and firms, or continued risk repricing in financial markets could all intensify the growth slowdown and trigger significant disruptions in highly interlinked cross-border supply chains. Rising inflation expectations by households could prolong inflationary pressures, especially in economies facing substantially higher trade costs or with still-tight labour markets, prompting more restrictive monetary policy and weakening growth prospects. Financial stability risks from still richly-valued and concentrated equity markets and high corporate financing needs could be triggered by additional risk repricing and amplified by forced asset sales by highly-leveraged non-bank financial intermediaries. On the upside, a reversal of the increase in trade barriers would support growth and reduce inflation, even if it did not immediately result in lower policy uncertainty. Steps to ease regulatory burdens, and an early resolution to conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, could also improve confidence and incentives to invest. 1. General assessment of the macroeconomic situation 12  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Against this backdrop, the key policy priorities are to ensure a lasting decline in trade tensions, policy uncertainty and inflation, establish a credible fiscal path to debt sustainability while providing temporary support to those vulnerable to economic shocks, and implement ambitious reforms to strengthen growth prospects and improve competitiveness. • Countries need to find ways of working together within the global trading system and to make trade policy more predictable. Agreements to ease trade tensions or potentially lower existing trade barriers would be welcome, improve policy certainty and strengthen the prospects for investment and growth. Steps to lower tariffs, deepen trade agreements or reduce barriers to trade in services would also benefit productivity and living standards. Key areas where opportunities exist for services trade reforms include further improvements in trade facilitation, reductions in regulatory barriers that impede access to national markets, and initiatives to enhance the cross-border digital delivery of services. • Central banks should remain vigilant given heightened uncertainty and the potential for initial increases in trade costs to push up wage and price pressures more generally. The balance of risks for central banks will vary across countries, with the downside effects of higher uncertainty and weaker exports likely to be the key influences on policy decisions in most countries, but upside inflationary pressures being a more pertinent concern in countries raising tariffs. Provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, and trade tensions do not intensify further, policy rate reductions should continue in economies in which underlying inflation is projected to moderate or remain subdued. • Faced with multiple spending pressures, governments need to ensure long-term debt sustainability and maintain the ability to react to future shocks. Stronger efforts to contain and reallocate spending and enhance revenues, set within credible medium-term country-specific adjustment paths, will be essential for debt burdens to remain manageable and to conserve the resources required to address longer term spending challenges. Higher debt service costs and some pressing spending needs, such as plans to raise defence spending substantially, are already forcing hard choices in some countries about the pace and composition of fiscal adjustment and limiting room for budgetary manoeuvre. In the near term, the automatic fiscal stabilisers should be allowed to operate fully to help cushion the adverse impact of trade tensions and elevated uncertainty. Targeted and well-designed support measures may also be needed to help companies but should be only temporary, as structural policy solutions are key if the adverse effects on external competitiveness are likely to endure. • Rising protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty and weak growth prospects reinforce the need for ambitious structural policy reforms that strengthen living standards and promote economic competitiveness. A strong focus should be placed on policies to revive business investment, innovation and labour productivity, particularly ones that have a limited near-term fiscal cost. Elevated policy uncertainty, declining business dynamism and perceived difficulties in funding future investment in intangible assets are factors that need to be addressed in many OECD economies to strengthen investment growth.  13 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Table 1.1. Global GDP growth is projected to slow StatLink 2https://stat.link/57dr8i Recent Developments Global growth has been resilient but trade policy changes raise new challenges After finishing 2024 on a sound footing, global GDP growth eased in the first quarter of 2025 (Figure 1.1, Panel A). However, economic developments were obscured by some front-loading of purchases ahead of the introduction of announced tariff rate increases. In the advanced economies, economic growth turned negative in the United States and Japan, but this was largely due to a surge in goods imports, with indicators of domestic demand growth holding up in both economies. Real GDP also contracted in the first quarter in Korea and several European economies, including Portugal, Norway, Slovenia, Denmark and Hungary. In contrast, output growth strengthened in Germany and the United Kingdom, partly reflecting stronger export growth, and remained solid in Spain and Ireland. Most emerging-market economies generally continued to expand at a solid pace in the first quarter of 2025. In China, growth slowed a little but remained resilient, supported by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and rapid export growth. There were also ongoing expansions in India, Indonesia and several Latin American economies, including Chile and Colombia. In Mexico, output growth picked up, helped by an improvement in agricultural output following weather-related disruptions in late 2024.

Per cent 14  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The impact of recent increases in bilateral tariff rates between the United States and its trading partners is likely to be increasingly evident in global economic indicators. These policy changes have coincided with a marked increase in newspaper-based measures of trade policy uncertainty (Figure 1.1, Panel B). As of mid-May, the United States had raised the tariff rate on most merchandise imports from China by 30% points, with China raising its tariff rate on merchandise imports from the United States by 10% points. Both countries had bilateral tariff rates of about 21% at the start of the year (Bown, 2025). The new rates are significantly below the peak bilateral tariff rates announced in April, which exceeded 100%, but it remains possible that those higher rates could be reinstated later this year. In addition, tariffs have been announced on those United States imports from Canada and Mexico not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, with Canada taking targeted retaliatory action in response. The United States has also imposed a default tariff increase of 10 percentage points on all other trading partners, with the possibility that many countries could face substantially higher tariffs from July 2025. Certain products have been excluded from these increases, including United States imports of automobiles and automobile parts and steel and aluminium products, which face a separate tariff of 25%. Ongoing legal challenges bring additional uncertainty on some of these tariff measures. Taken together, the new tariffs introduced by the United States this year up to mid-May are estimated to have raised the (ex-ante) effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports to 15.4%, from just over 2% in 2024, taking it to the highest rate since 1938 (Box 1.1).1 The US tariffs, together with retaliatory action by China, as well as more limited action by Canada, means that trade equivalent to over 2% of world GDP is now directly facing higher tariffs, pointing to much greater disruption than during the US-China trade tensions in 2018-19. If current applied tariffs are sustained, effective tariff rates are likely to fall over time, as trade in more heavily-tariffed goods is likely to slow. Figure 1.1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/cieo1r Higher bilateral tariff rates are a drag on global activity and add to trade costs, raising the price of covered imported final goods for consumers and intermediate inputs for businesses, particularly in countries where tariffs are imposed. The initial effect on prices is likely to be felt close to the time of the tariffs being 1 Effective tariff rates weight the rise in a given tariff line with the share those imports constitute; for the purposes of these calculations 2024 US Census Bureau data are used.  15 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 implemented, with the full impacts on output growth taking longer to materialise. Tariffs raise revenues for the government imposing them, but may also create distortions. The use of these additional revenues will condition the size and distribution of the economic impacts. At the same time, the expected slowing in economic growth in countries imposing tariffs will reduce other tax revenues. The impacts of recent trade policy changes may be more pronounced given heightened policy uncertainty, with elevated caution by businesses and consumers further weighing on investment and consumption growth.2 Taken together, higher tariffs and heightened uncertainty would be expected to weaken trade activity, although there is an upside risk in the very near term if exporters further bring forward trade to try and avoid the possibility of reciprocal or sectoral tariff rates being raised further in the next 2-3 months. 2 Heightened uncertainty will also reduce trade through a variety of channels, including through the effect on investment and raising the costs of inventories (Novy and Taylor, 2020; Limao and Maggi, 2015). 16  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Box 1.1. The impact of US tariff policy changes will be significant This box outlines the main tariff changes implemented by the United States, the impact on the effective tariff rates across countries and the goods trade that might be affected. The Box reflects the tariffs applied as of mid-May, despite some uncertainty pertaining to ongoing legal challenges. The extent of recent tariff changes from the United States and China is significantly larger than the previous episode of US-China trade tensions in 2018, with new tariff increases covering a broader range of goods. Even though bilateral goods trade between the United States and China has declined as a share of their total trade since 2018, it still represented around 2.5% of world goods trade in 2023 according to the OECD Balanced International Merchandise Trade dataset. Taking into account zero\u0002rated items as well as tariffs on United States imports from other countries, trade equivalent to 2.2% of world GDP will be affected by the new tariffs (Figure 1.2, Panel A). In 2024, according to US data, China accounted for 6.9% of the United States’ merchandise exports, and 13.3% of US merchandise imports. As a result of the combined trade policy changes introduced since January this year, the average effective tariff from the United States will rise to historically high levels, based on 2024 import patterns (Figure 1.2, Panel B). US imports of cars and car parts, and steel and aluminium products are now subject to an additional 25% tariff. In addition, tariffs have been raised on all countries by the United States, but with some sectoral and product exemptions. Collectively, the distribution of these tariff increases, as of mid-May, differs widely by country (Figure 1.2, Panel C). • Announced tariff increases have been highest for China, at 30%. • Canada and Mexico also face higher tariffs, but a different tariff regime. They do not qualify for the exemptions granted to other countries, but rather face tariffs of either 25% or 0%, depending on whether their merchandise exports to the United States are compliant with the United States Mexico Canada trade agreement (USMCA). On average, around one-half of their imports into the United States are thought to be USMCA-compliant at present, with compliance depending on the extent of local content and the filing of relevant rules-of-origin documentation. • The high proportion of cars and parts in total exports to the United States raises the effective rates faced by Mexico, as well as a number of Asian and European countries, including Japan, Korea, Germany and the Slovak Republic. For Canada, the impact of the higher effective rate on cars and car parts is offset by the 10% tariff applied on its energy exports to the United States. • In contrast, some products currently remain exempt from tariffs, including pharmaceuticals, semi-conductors and other zero-rated items such as copper. This helps to lower considerably the effective US tariff on imports from countries such as Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The United States is an important export market for a number of countries, accounting for around 75% of goods exports for Mexico and Canada, 19% for Japan, 13% for China and 10% for Germany in 2023 (Figure 1.3). The importance of exports for overall activity also varies greatly by country. Exports to the United States are equivalent to over 20% of GDP in its North American trading partners, over 5% of GDP for many smaller open Asian economies and Korea, and between 3 and 4% of GDP for many European countries, including Germany and many of its key European supply chain partners. Exports from emerging-market economies such as China, India, South Africa and Türkiye represent a smaller share of their domestic output. In value-added terms, the extent of direct exposure to the United States via exports is often smaller because of offsetting effects from intermediate inputs used in production for final exports. However, indirect exposures can also be significant due to integrated cross-border supply chains in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Data on the extent of such exposures is less timely, but highlight the comparatively  17 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 high exposures of Mexico, Canada, Ireland, Korea and some other Latin American economies, such as Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica (Figure 1.4). Imports into the United States also include around 0.5% of US value-added that was previously exported from the United States. Combined sector exposures are likely to be largest for the wholesale and retail sector, as well as cars and other manufacturing industries such as ICT, machinery and electrical equipment. In addition to weaker trade volumes, domestic price increases are likely to follow higher tariffs, although the exact magnitude is subject to some uncertainty. Around 10% of the consumer basket in the United States is imported, directly and indirectly, before taking into account food and energy (Barbiero and Stein, 2025). It is likely that most of the impact of tariff increases will be borne by consumers and businesses, as occurred in the United States in 2018/19 when US tariffs on Chinese imports rose (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal, 2022; Amiti et al., 2020 and Cavallo et al., 2021). The extent of price increases faced by consumers will depend on whether retailers just raise prices to cover the higher dollar cost or whether they maintain their current price-cost margin. For example, if retailers just passed\u0002through the additional costs of a 60% tariff increase on China and a 10% tariff rise on the rest of the world, consumer prices could be expected to rise by 1.4 percentage points. By contrast, if retailers maintained a constant margin of selling prices over purchasing costs, consumer prices could rise 2.2 percentage points (Barbiero and Stein, 2025). The eventual cost increases to consumers might further be mitigated by dollar appreciation, or if exporters or domestic producers lower their margins. However, experience from the 2018-2019 tariffs showed that even local producers who are not affected by imports may raise prices when most major competitors are being forced to raise costs, without fear of losing market share (Flaaen et al, 2020). There is also evidence that price increases tended to be rapid, often occurring within two to three months (Minton and Somale, 2025). There are signs that a similar pattern may emerge this year. Minton and Somale (2025) estimate that US consumers already faced a 0.3 percentage point rise in core goods prices in March stemming from tariff increases on Chinese goods in February and March. Carvallo et al (2025) also find marked increases in US retailers’ prices of goods imported from China. Survey evidence suggests that US firms which rely on imported inputs tend to have markedly higher inflation expectations for 2025 than firms with low or no imported inputs (Edwards et al, 2025) and most importers expect to pass on cost increases over the next two years, in response to a range of tariff scenarios (Andrade et al., 2025). In other countries, weaker economic activity in the United States may exert downward pressure on commodity prices and selling prices as exporters seek to aggressively expand into new markets. On the other hand, currency depreciation due to lower risk appetite and fears of further tariff action to protect industries may limit the extent of price discounting. 18  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.2. Recent trade policy announcements imply substantial change in effective tariffs Note: Estimates based on trade policy announcements as of 14 May 2025. Panel A based on the USD value of affected imported US goods at the HS8 digit level, scaled by the share of nominal US goods imports as a share of nominal world GDP. Retaliation includes announced measures by Canada (USD 65bn) and China (all US exports), scaled by the share of nominal US goods imports as a share of nominal world GDP. Panel B based on the US International Trade Commission (USITC) estimate of the average effective tariffs until 2024. For 2025, the average tariff rate is calculated based on HS classifications of tariff-affected items matched to US Census Bureau data for 2024 import weights of product categories. Panel C excludes any estimate of the impact of the de minimis trade policy changes. The net sector-specific adjustment change includes a 25% tariff for listed cars and parts except for US-related content, provided that meets a minimum 20% (Canadian cars are assumed to have 25% US content, Mexico 20% and rest of world 0%, rounding results from the 2020 TiVA tables); a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium products; 0% tariff increases on any items listed in the official exclusions to the tariffs for all countries other than Canada and Mexico; and a 10% increase in tariff rates on all other goods for all countries, with the exception of Canada, Mexico and China. Mexico and Canada face a 25% tariff, except for energy and potash products from Canada which face a 10% tariff, and USMCA compliant goods which face a 0% tariff. Assuming 50% compliance, this equates to an effective tariff rate of 12.5% for all non-car goods. The United Kingdom is assumed to have a 10% tariff on cars based on the quota specified in the announced US-UK trade agreement, which accounted for 80% of the cars and parts exports, and 0% tariff on steel and aluminium. Data classifications are based on HS8 lists as published by the US administration. Weights are calculated based on 2024 US Census Bureau product level data for US imports, by country.

Consumer confidence was already below long-run average levels in most economies but has shown further notable declines in Sweden, the United States, Lithuania and South Africa in the early months of 2025 (Figure 1.5, Panel A). In contrast, confidence has recently picked up in Türkiye, Poland and Chile. Empirical estimates suggest that the sharp fall in consumer confidence in the United States is mostly attributable to the increase in policy uncertainty since December 2024 (Figure 1.5, Panel B). The pace of retail sales has eased since last year in the United States and the euro area but has displayed greater resilience in China (Figure 1.5, Panel C). Business surveys suggest a slowdown in Canada, Mexico, Spain and the United States since the start of 2025 (Figure 1.5, Panel D), with available measures suggesting wide dispersion in firms’ expectations regarding the duration of tariffs. However, new orders for manufacturing goods remained strong in some euro area economies, including Germany and France, sustaining the pick-up seen since the start of the year. Some of the ongoing strength in manufacturing activity in these economies likely reflects a temporary surge in demand for tradeable goods given the perceived risk of higher tariff rates from July 2025. Figure 1.5. Recent economic indicators have weakened in several large economies Note: In Panel A, the most recent data are for April 2025, except for Chile, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa (March 2025), and Switzerland (February 2025). The latest information for Canada refers to the first quarter of 2025, and relates to 'Perceiving their financial situation is currently deteriorating'. The scenario in Panel B is based on the results from a cross-country model that regresses consumer confidence on developments in core, food and energy inflation, the unemployment rate, the share market index, house prices and the economic policy uncertainty index. The scenario assumes all else constant apart from economic policy uncertainty which remains at the level observed in December 2024. Panel D shows PMI manufacturing output for Mexico.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/yqop58  21 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Merchandise trade volumes rose strongly in late 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, helped by front-loading, with some exporters bringing forward planned shipments to the United States ahead of expected tariff increases (Figure 1.6, Panel A). The surge in US imports has been most apparent in industrial supplies, including steel and aluminium, in late 2024, and pharmaceutical goods in the first quarter of 2025, and has been accompanied by rising inventory growth for manufacturers and many retailers. International air freight traffic also rose in March and April, likely due to front-loading. More broadly, global container traffic continued to expand in the first quarter of 2025 and survey measures of manufacturing export orders have improved steadily in the advanced economies, with a normalisation in Germany (Figure 1.6, Panel B). Nonetheless, some signs are emerging that weaker performance is expected. Global container prices in April were 40% lower than at the start of the year. Routes between Shanghai and the United States have been heavily affected, both by the introduction of tariffs, which precipitated sharp declines, and the recent reduction in US-China tariff rates, which resulted in a 30% rebound in container shipping rates since the announcement – although rates remain 30% lower than at the end of 2024.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/j3mb1t Financial market volatility has subsided but higher risk aversion persists After pronounced turbulence in April, financial markets have normalised, with a strong rebound in global equity prices, declining equity and bond market volatility and a broad stabilisation of sovereign bond yields. Nonetheless, financial market conditions remain tighter than in late 2024 (Figure 1.7), as market volatility remains elevated and signs of risk aversion persist in some market segments, including for lower-rated corporate bonds and global companies exposed to the US market. In contrast to typical episodes of risk repricing, the US dollar has depreciated since the start of April, with investors significantly reducing their exposure to US financial assets. 22  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.7.

Equity markets recovered in May, after experiencing a sharp decline across several advanced and emerging-market economies following the US announcement of larger-than-expected tariffs on all trading partners in early April. Equity market performance in 2025 has been strongest in Europe and in selected emerging-market economies, particularly Brazil and Mexico. In Japan and the United States, equity valuations have essentially caught up to their levels at end-December 2024. Equity risk premia have recently declined after moderate increases in the United States, the United Kingdom and in Europe, while asset valuations continue to remain stretched. There are persisting signs of some differences across companies according to their potential exposure to tariff barriers. Since mid-February, the equity prices of companies more highly exposed to the US market have underperformed others (Figure 1.8, Panel A). The magnitude of the decline has varied across regions, with the largest impact in China and Asia-Pacific economies. European companies have been affected to a lesser extent. As the announced tariffs have been relatively broad, the negative effects have weighed on equity prices in most sectors. The equity prices of US companies with significant international exposure also initially underperformed their more domestically focused counterparts in March and April, particularly in consumer goods and industrial sectors (Figure 1.8, Panel B), although this has subsequently moderated as the perceived risk of widespread retaliatory trade policy measures by other countries on imports from the United States has eased.  23 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.8.

Panel A displays two global non-financial corporate equity indices, excluding US companies. The first index reflects the stock performance of firms that are particularly sensitive to recent US policy changes, while the second represents the broader non-financial corporate equity market. Sensitive corporates are defined as ones with sales in the United States equal or exceeding 20% of their total sales. Panel B shows equity indices of internationally exposed and not internationally-exposed US non-financial corporates along with the broader non-financial corporate US equity benchmark.

Source: OECD calculations. Despite several episodes of volatility, long-term sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies currently stand at levels broadly similar to those recorded at the end of December 2024. After considerable fluctuations in April, yields have however increased in some advanced economies in recent weeks, notably in the United States where yields have been pushed up by a rising term premium amid concerns about policy uncertainty and public debt sustainability. In contrast, after a significant rise in March following the announcement of substantial additional expenditures on defence and infrastructure in Germany in the wake of the debt brake reform, long-term sovereign bond yields in the euro area have since declined, as investors have been seeking safe-haven assets. At the same time, policy rate cuts have continued in most advanced economies and some emerging-market economies, and markets continue to price in further rate reductions in most advanced economies. Amid higher volatility in equity and currency markets, changes in sovereign bond yields in emerging-market economies have been relatively muted. Spreads on USD-denominated sovereign bonds have mostly reversed their increases in early April and are generally around their 2019 levels in major emerging-market economies. In Mexico, long-term yields have steadily declined over the year, reflecting the weaker economic outlook. In Brazil, long-term yields have also recently declined, partly due to expectations of easing inflationary pressures, but are still around end-2024 levels and relatively high. In Colombia as well as South Africa and Türkiye, bond yields have risen in 2025 and are, on average, now higher than in the 2010s. In contrast, bond yields in many Asian emerging-market economies are around or below the average levels observed during the previous decade. Chinese long-term bond yields have weakened in April, with the expansion of fiscal support offset by the higher trade tensions and monetary policy easing, and are close to record lows. Long-term bond yields in India and smaller open economies such as Malaysia and Thailand have fallen since early 2025. 24  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Corporate credit spreads over risk-free rates have narrowed from their peak levels in 2025, but remain elevated, particularly for lower-rated corporate bonds (Figure 1.9, Panel B). This signals growing market concerns over riskier assets, especially in the United States. Spreads on corporate bonds and leveraged loans had previously been at low levels, encouraging strong issuance but also raising risks of a sharp repricing if downside risks materialised. Leveraged loan issuance in the first quarter of 2025 was 40% higher than a year earlier. However, issuance of high-yield corporate bonds of the lowest ratings has been muted in the United States since early April. This freeze poses risks for private equity firms that often depend on the junk bond market for funding acquisitions, as well as for banks providing short-term loans for such transactions before firms secure longer-term financing. Bank lending and deposit rates have declined broadly in line with policy rate reductions, with signs of improvement in credit demand. However, credit standards for loans to firms tightened slightly in the euro area in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a rise in perceived risks about the economic outlook. Figure 1.9. Volatility has eased, but lower-rated corporate bond spreads remain elevated Note: Based on data up to 27 May 2025.

Labour markets were easing but remained tight before new tariff measures Employment conditions were already easing in many economies before the announcement of new trade policy measures, but labour markets generally remained in solid health. Median annualised employment growth in the final quarter of 2024 was 0.3% in the OECD, down from 0.8% in the first half of the year. Employment growth had also started to slow in some large non-OECD economies, including Brazil. Nonetheless, employment as a share of the working-age population was generally high compared with the pre-pandemic period, reflecting both relatively low unemployment and increased participation rates (Figure 1.10, Panel A). This was often enabled by older workers significantly increasing participation, such as in Czechia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain (Figure 1.10, Panel B). While the employment effects of the new tariffs and heightened policy uncertainty remain unclear, employment has fallen in recent months in some economies, including Canada and Japan. Employment conditions from business surveys have also eased notably, including in the United States, China, Canada, Mexico and India.  25 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.10.

Source: OECD Labour Market database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/zjyf1c Nominal wage growth was moderating at the start of the year, but remained high in many regions compared to the pre-pandemic period. In most advanced economies, strong wage growth accompanied by limited productivity gains had kept unit labour cost growth above levels consistent with central bank inflation targets. Strong minimum wage increases were supporting ongoing wage momentum in some European economies, and robust base pay growth in Japan was accompanied by high winter bonus payments and a strong outcome in the annual wage negotiations for the 2025 financial year. Real wages were growing robustly at the end of 2024 and had returned to or surpassed pre-pandemic levels in most OECD countries following gradual disinflation. The imposition of new tariffs may result in stronger nominal wage demands as households respond to higher final goods prices. For example, around three quarters of respondents to the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations, undertaken in January and February 2025, expected their cost of living to increase because of the trade conflict. Inflationary pressures have resurfaced in some economies Inflationary pressures were still lingering in many economies early in 2025, with inflation often above target levels (Figure 1.11, Panel A). In the OECD, services price inflation remained elevated, largely due to stickiness in housing cost growth. At the same time, goods inflation had begun to rise, albeit from very low levels, primarily owing to stronger food price inflation (Figure 1.11, Panel B). The recent strengthening of food prices was most evident in Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in some emerging-market economies like Costa Rica and Colombia. Overall, inflation developments in emerging\u0002market economies have been more disparate. Despite having eased, annual headline inflation in Argentina and Türkiye was still tracking at double-digit rates, respectively, in early 2025. In contrast, inflation in China remained close to zero as of April. 26  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Business surveys suggest manufacturing input and output prices have moved higher in advanced economies this year, particularly in Canada and the United States (Figure 1.11, Panels C and D). However, such measures do not suggest upward momentum in final services prices so far. Increased import tariffs are expected to induce an upward adjustment to price levels in the levying country. The persistence of the inflationary impact will depend on whether this is accompanied by higher nominal wage demands and increases in firm mark-ups. The magnitude of such second-round effects is likely to be more modest in economies with well-anchored inflation expectations. Figure 1.11. Inflation remains high with goods inflation having recently picked up Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; OECD Consumer Prices database; S&P Global; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/nelod7 Aggregate inflation expectations have moved higher in some economies. Financial market measures of 10-year breakeven inflation in major economies have not moved greatly, including in the United States (Figure 1.12, Panel A). However, short-run household inflation expectations have spiked in a few economies in recent months, most notably in the United States, but also in Canada and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.12, Panel B). This may partly reflect the recent inflation increase in items salient to household budgets, such as food, as well as the anticipated impact of higher tariffs on inflation. More granular data of both one-year-ahead and three-year-ahead inflation expectations highlight that the aggregate movements have reflected an increasing proportion of households expecting inflation to exceed 4% (see Box 1.2 below). Corporate inflation expectations have also increased in several advanced economies, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan (Figure 1.12, Panels C and D).  27 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.12.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/lxz1mo Projections Global GDP growth is projected to slow from 3.3% in 2024, to 2.9% in 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.13, Panel A; Table 1.1), with weakening economic prospects particularly evident in North America and some Asian economies, especially China (Figure 1.13, Panel B). On a Q4/Q4 basis, global growth is expected to slip to just 2.6% by the fourth quarter of 2025, from 3.4% in 2024, before recovering to 3% through 2026. These projections are based on a technical assumption that the bilateral tariff rates prevailing in mid-May persist through the rest of 2025 and 2026, despite ongoing legal challenges. Higher bilateral tariff rates and elevated policy uncertainty are expected to weigh on growth in business investment and trade. At the same time, consumer spending is also projected to soften in most economies as fragile sentiment and lingering cost of living pressures are compounded by the impact of higher trade costs on final goods prices and, in some countries, weaker labour market developments. The revised global growth projections are weaker than in the December 2024 OECD Economic Outlook and also the version of the March 2025 OECD Interim Economic Outlook projections that adopted the most comparable technical assumptions related to trade barriers (the “light tariff scenario”; Figure 1.13, Panel C). Inflation in G20 countries is expected to moderate gradually through 2026, with the inflationary impact from higher trade barriers offset by lower oil prices over 2025-26 and softer growth (Figure 1.13, Panel D; Annex 1.A). The United States is a key exception, with annual headline and core inflation now projected to peak at around 3.9% and 4.0% respectively in the fourth quarter of 2025 and remain above target in 2026. 28  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.13.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4w3gms Central banks in many OECD economies are assumed to further lower monetary policy rates to mitigate the severity of the slowdown in economic growth and employment conditions. However, policy rates are expected to remain unchanged in 2025 in the United States given the upside risks to inflation. Another exception is Japan, where persisting inflation is anticipated to warrant continued gradual policy interest rate increases. Fiscal policy is assumed to tighten modestly in most of the large OECD economies over 2025-26, with the sustainability of public debt a common concern, but less so in many of the smaller economies. However, Germany’s reform of its fiscal rules and planned increase in defence and infrastructure spending are assumed to result in a sizeable stimulus in 2026, and much stronger public investment. In the United States, the assumed enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is also expected to result in some additional fiscal support in 2026. Most emerging-market economies are assumed to have a broadly neutral fiscal policy stance with some further monetary policy easing. China is an exception, with significant further fiscal expansion expected in 2025, with policy rates expected to be kept around currently low levels. The prospects for individual major economies and regions are as follows: • In the United States, output growth is expected to slow significantly due to the substantially higher effective tariff rate on imports, combined with retaliatory measures from some trading partners, elevated policy uncertainty and softer real income growth. In addition, a further slowdown in net  29 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 immigration and reduction in the federal workforce are anticipated to moderate growth. On an annual basis, GDP growth is projected to weaken from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, with growth in the year to the fourth quarter of 2025 declining to just 1.1%. Similarly, new trade restrictions are anticipated to weigh on activity in Canada, with monetary policy assumed to provide only modest further support amid lingering inflation concerns. Canadian GDP growth is projected to fall from 1.5% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. In both economies, a sizeable price level change is projected, with inflation anticipated to spike in mid-2025 before moderating towards target over time. • The Japanese economy is expected to expand at a moderate pace, with private consumption growth supported by strong wage gains and business investment growth underpinned by healthy profits and government subsidies. Offsetting forces will be subdued external demand amid new trade restrictions and elevated trade policy uncertainty, with GDP growth projected to moderate from 0.7% in 2025 to 0.4% in 2026. In Korea, growth is projected to recover, with stronger real incomes and improving labour market conditions supporting household spending. After dipping from 2.1% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025, GDP growth is projected to be 2.2% in 2026. • Growth in the euro area is projected to remain modest at 1.0% in 2025, after 0.8% in 2024, before picking up to 1.2% in 2026, with increased trade frictions being offset by ongoing capital spending from NextGenerationEU funds, resilient labour markets and a recent easing of credit conditions. Additional cuts to monetary policy rates and the projected fiscal expansion in Germany are also expected to support growth, particularly next year. Modest increases in unemployment rates are expected to be accompanied by further moderation in wage growth. Price pressures are expected to abate further, with headline inflation in the euro area projected to be back around target in 2026. In the United Kingdom, growth is projected to be around estimated potential, at 1.3% in 2025 and 1.0% in 2026, as trade tensions and elevated uncertainty offset the positive impact from last autumn’s budgetary measures on government consumption and investment. • In China, after robust growth at the start of 2025, the tightening of bilateral tariff rates and the planned elimination of the de minimis exemption on imports to the United States, combined with retaliatory trade measures, will weaken output growth. However, this is expected to be partly offset by domestic fiscal stimulus focused on government subsidies for consumer goods and social transfers. Real GDP growth is projected to ease from 5.0% in 2024 to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, with increased trade costs and recent increases in global food prices pushing inflation up from its currently low levels. • India and Indonesia are projected to continue to experience strong and broadly stable economic growth. While easing monetary policy will aid ongoing expansions in both economies, higher tariffs in the United States, global trade policy uncertainty, and domestic fiscal policy uncertainty in Indonesia, will have an offsetting effect. In India, economic growth is projected to be 6.3% in FY2025-26 and 6.4% in FY2026-27, while the Indonesian economy is expected to grow by 4.7% in 2025 and 4.8% in 2026. Inflation in both economies is projected to remain largely benign, although past currency depreciation in Indonesia will feed through into higher domestic prices and push up inflation this year. • Growth in Mexico is projected to slow further in 2025 as higher trade barriers are combined with subdued increases in public spending. However, monetary policy easing will be a supportive factor, with output growth projected to be 0.4% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. In Brazil, growth is also expected to slow from 3.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, as restrictive monetary policy and new trade barriers are only partially offset by the positive impact of expansionary fiscal policy. Inflation is projected to remain high but to fall back into the central bank target range in the second half of 2026. 30  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The substantial changes to trade policies up to mid-May, with a technical assumption that they persist through the remainder of 2025 and 2026 are a significant drag to world trade in goods and services. Global trade is now projected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026, 0.8 and 1.3 percentage points lower respectively than the projections in the December 2024 OECD Economic Outlook. Much of the decline reflects lower trade in the United States, China, and regional partners who are heavily integrated into their global supply chains (Figure 1.14, Panel A). In 2025, the introduction of US import tariffs and greater trade policy uncertainty will also weigh on Europe, but a pick-up in domestic growth in Germany in 2026 should fuel a recovery in intra-EU trade. The front-loading of exports to the United States in late 2024 and early 2025, together with a continued expansion of services trade, limit the overall decline in annual trade volume growth in 2025. Nonetheless, quarterly trade growth is expected to remain weak for some time and global trade volumes in the fourth quarter of 2026 are 2.1% lower than previously projected (Figure 1.14, Panel B). Many emerging-market economies, particularly commodity exporters, are expected to have much softer export growth as demand from both China and the United States is lower. However, some countries such as Argentina and Chile are relatively insulated, with half of their exports to the United States tariff exempt. Figure 1.14.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/9we63h Despite the sizeable shifts in world trade volumes, changes in national current account balances are expected to be relatively limited (Figure 1.15, Panel A). Some key surplus countries such as China see a sharp slowdown in imports alongside exports, whilst in the United States weaker export growth limits the improvement in the overall current account that would have been generated by weaker import growth. One exception is Germany, where fiscal policy changes are expected to boost domestic demand and raise import growth even as export growth weakens due to trade policy changes; this results in a lower current account surplus. Overall, most countries’ current account balances are a smaller share of world GDP than prior to the global financial crisis, and remain largely unchanged over 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.15, Panel B).  31 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.15.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/eron8u Employment growth in the OECD is expected to weaken, with the annual pace of employment gains in the median OECD country projected to be 0.7% over 2025-26, down from 1% in 2024 (Figure 1.16, Panel A). Employment growth is projected to be more resilient in some non-OECD emerging economies, such as India and South Africa, but to continue to slow in China as the ageing population further reduces labour supply. Labour force growth is also generally projected to ease from its recent fast pace, with migration inflows moderating in some economies. Consequently, the median unemployment rate across OECD economies is projected to remain broadly stable over the projection horizon. However, higher unemployment is projected in the United States as growth slows, with the unemployment rate rising towards 4½ per cent in the first half of 2026 before starting to moderate. With demand and supply in labour markets in better balance, nominal wage growth is projected to continue to ease in most economies (Figure 1.16, Panel B). This will combine with a projected improvement in labour productivity growth to facilitate further easing in unit labour cost growth and, in turn, reduce inflationary pressures. Further declines in headline inflation are projected in most advanced and emerging-market economies where inflation is currently exceeding the central bank target (Figure 1.17). In addition to the United States, exceptions include South Africa, where inflation will be pushed up by an increase in value added tax and the narrowing output gap, and Brazil, where a recent upturn in services inflation will keep annual inflation high despite a projected fall in quarterly inflation throughout 2026. In the euro area, inflation will remain relatively elevated in a number of economies with tight labour markets, including Latvia, Lithuania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. 32  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.16.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0x94gc  33 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Risks Growth could be hit by more restrictive trade policies, prolonged uncertainty and tighter financial conditions A key risk is that bilateral tariff rates are raised further on merchandise imports into the United States, potentially prompting retaliatory measures by trade partners. Such developments would be likely to intensify risk repricing in financial markets and prolong policy uncertainty. This would also sap confidence, add to the downward pressures on corporate and household spending around the world, and weaken global demand for many key commodities. A set of illustrative simulations using the NiGEM global macroeconomic model in forward-looking mode highlights the different near-term effects that some of these developments might have (Figure 1.18): • A scenario in which US bilateral tariff rates are raised further by an additional 10 percentage points on all countries could lower global output by just under 0.3% by the second year, with a larger fall of 0.6% in the United States. Inflation would also be higher, rising by an average 0.8 percentage points per annum in the United States in the first two years and by close to 0.5 percentage points per annum in the world. While the strongest effects are felt in the United States, weaker US import demand reduces export growth in all trading partners, and an appreciation in the dollar effective exchange rate of close to 4% mitigates the inflationary impact in the United States but raises import prices elsewhere. • The initial shock to growth would be amplified if accompanied by a further deterioration in global equity markets and heightened risk premia due to greater uncertainty, and greater precautionary saving by consumers. In the illustrative scenario, equity prices are assumed to fall by 10%, investment risk premia increase by 50 basis points and household saving rates to rise by 1 percentage point, with these shocks lasting for two years. Collectively, the combined shocks could push global output down by around 1.2% by the second year, with larger declines in many advanced economies. The additional demand shocks are deflationary, reducing both consumer spending and investment, and so the impact of higher trade costs on inflation would be reduced, with the increase in global inflation slowing to an average 0.2 percentage points per annum over the first two years. • Commodity prices are likely to be an additional shock absorber, with weaker global demand likely to push down prices, at least in the near term. This would help to support real incomes in commodity-importing economies and lower headline consumer price inflation. An illustrative decline of 10% in global oil and gas prices could reduce global inflation by an average 0.3 percentage points per annum in the first two years, with the largest declines in more energy\u0002intensive non-OECD economies, and raise global output by around 0.1%. Combined with the other illustrative shocks, global inflation would be little changed overall, with global output falling by 1.1% by the second year of the shock. • The balance of these different shocks if they were to occur would have implications for macroeconomic policies. In the illustrative initial trade policy shock, policy interest rates are raised in the United States to help mitigate potential second-round effects on inflation, with rates rising relative to baseline by around ¾ percentage points on average in the first two years. The appreciation of the dollar exchange rate helps to raise import prices in other countries, with policy interest rates rising modestly in most in response. In the full combined shock, policy interest rates decline in all economies, reflecting the overall deflationary nature of these shocks. Fiscal pressures would increase as a result of the combined shocks, with weaker activity initially reducing tax revenue and higher unemployment adding to spending costs. After two years, government debt-to GDP ratios are raised by around 2 percentage points in the typical advanced economy. 34  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The impact of additional policy uncertainty could be even higher than shown in the illustrative scenario. Empirical estimates suggest that a one standard deviation shock to the economic policy uncertainty index is associated with a 1% cumulative decline in investment (see further discussion in Chapter 2). To put this in context, the economic policy uncertainty index for Canada rose by over 9 standard deviations between October 2024 and March 2025. Figure 1.18. Further trade cost increases and heightened uncertainty would harm growth Note: Simulated impact of an unanticipated increase of 10 percentage points in US tariffs on all non-commodity imports, a decline of 10% in equity prices in all countries, a rise of 50 basis points in global investment risk premia, a rise of 1 percentage point in household saving rates in all countries and a 10% decline in oil and natural gas prices. The tariff increases persist but the other shocks are assumed to fade gradually after two years. Source: OECD calculations using the NiGEM macroeconomic model. StatLink 2https://stat.link/y7updh Inflation could be more persistent An additional downside risk is that inflation remains stickier than otherwise anticipated. This could prompt more restrictive monetary policy, weakening growth prospects. Inflation remains above central bank targets in most OECD economies. In addition, the higher tariff rates imposed by the United States and China may result in higher-than-expected upward price adjustments for final goods in these economies, and higher costs that feed through to export prices. Any future effective exchange rate depreciation in other countries would also further raise import prices in these jurisdictions. As discussed above, another key risk is that tariff-induced price increases are accompanied by significant second round effects that cause further inflation persistence. Workers’ responding to lower purchasing power by pushing for higher nominal wages could raise costs for firms that may be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices. Attempts by companies to maintain their existing price-cost margins would also amplify the impact of the initial rise in import costs. Tight labour markets in many economies, combined with signs of rising consumer (Box 1.2) and corporate inflation expectations in some economies (Figure 1.12, Panel C), are factors that may elevate the probability of this risk occurring. Labour-intensive services sectors could experience particularly high inflation under such a scenario.  35 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Box 1.2. The distribution of household inflation expectations The distribution of inflation expectations provides information about the degree to which expectations are anchored to central bank inflation targets and how risks to inflation expectations are evolving through time. Recent moves upward in one-year ahead aggregate inflation expectations in the United States and Canada have been accompanied by a material increase in the proportion of respondents expecting inflation to exceed 4% in these economies. Around 48% of respondents in the United States in April 2025 expected inflation to be above that level, up from 35% in November 2024 (Figure 1.19, Panel A). In Canada, the proportion of respondents expecting inflation above 4% one-year ahead rose to 57% in the first quarter of 2025 from 44% in the fourth quarter of 2024 (Figure 1.19, Panel C). While there has also been an upward shift in the distribution of inflation expectations in some European economies, including Spain and the United Kingdom, this has not been the case in others, such as France, Italy, Germany and Belgium (Figure 1.19, Panel E and F). Figure 1.19. An increasing share of households in the United States and Canada are now expecting high inflation Note: In Panels E and F, “Latest” is March 2025 for all countries other than the United Kingdom (February 2025).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/e3hkrc 36  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 In comparison to the period immediately prior to the pandemic, the proportion of respondents in the United States and Canada expecting inflation to be at the inflation target has declined. This is also apparent when assessing the shifts in the distribution of expectations for inflation in the medium term (three-years ahead for the United States and two-years ahead for Canada; Figure 1.19, Panel B and D). There has also been a slight decline between late 2024 and early 2025 in the share of respondents expecting inflation to be at target. Corporate financial strains may prompt further risk repricing and spillovers across financial institutions Risk repricing in financial markets could be even more extensive in the event of downside surprises to economic growth or a resurgence of inflation. This would heighten market volatility and increase risks to financial stability. Despite recent moderation, asset valuations remain elevated in the United States and a few other markets (Figure 1.20, Panel A), and equity benchmarks remain highly concentrated (Figure 1.20, Panel B). Across both advanced and emerging economies, earnings expectations have continued to grow (Figure 1.21, Panel A), although some signs have begun to appear recently that suggest expected earnings may have plateaued in the United States. Potential risks to corporate earnings include a greater-than-expected impact of higher trade costs on profitability, as well as a more extensive economic slowdown than projected (Figure 1.21, Panel B). If there is a downward adjustment to earnings expectations, there could be sizeable further equity market corrections. Figure 1.20. Equity prices remain richly valued and many financial markets are increasingly concentrated Note: Panel A shows price-to-earnings ratios in selected G20 economies. Based on data up to 27 May 2025. The current price-to-earnings ratio (PER) is calculated by dividing the share price by the trailing 12-month earnings per share (June 2024 to May 2025) for companies listed in the benchmark. The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) is calculated using 10-year average “cyclically-adjusted” earnings, expressed in April 2025 prices. A higher CAPE ratio compared to the PER indicates that stocks are richly valued. The concentration of equity benchmarks in Panel B is the share of the top 20 companies in the total market capitalisation of each equity benchmark for advanced and emerging-market economies. The concentration in corporate bond markets is based on the share of total issuance by the 100 top bond issuers each year.

These companies have been selected among the top 500 companies listed in selected equity benchmarks. For example, in the United States 28% of the companies with a correction were technology firms. Source: OECD calculations. Elevated levels of marketable and non-marketable corporate debt,3 with a large and growing share of non\u0002investment-grade bonds and leveraged loans,4 and high corporate refinancing needs in the near future pose risks to financial stability (OECD, 2024a; OECD, 2025a). The expected default risk premium for low\u0002rated corporates has risen markedly in North America, Europe, and Asia since mid-February, and despite recent moderation remains above levels observed prior to the announcement of higher tariffs in the United States. (Figure 1.22, Panel A). Concerns that banks could face higher non-performing loans were reflected in the decline in their price-to-book value ratios in April 2025 (Figure 1.22, Panel B) and higher expected default risk premia at large banks around the world. Weaker corporate financial conditions, combined with high uncertainty induced by additional tariffs in the world trading system, could also raise financing costs and deter fixed investment.5 3 Corporate debt (including both loans and bonds) in advanced economies declined to USD 54 trillion (94% of GDP) in 2024, down from a peak of USD 62 trillion (108% of GDP) in 2020. Corporate debt (broadly defined) in emerging economies remained elevated at USD 39 trillion (91% of GDP) in 2024, down from the record levels observed in 2020 (106% of GDP). Estimates are based on data on credit to the non-financial sector from the Bank for International Settlements. 4 The share of high-yield bond issuance in total bond issuance by non-financial corporates increased from 16% in 2009 to 22% in 2023, and the average share of leveraged loans in the total syndicated loans of non-financial corporates increased from an average 38% between 2000 and 2012 to 43% between 2013 and 2024. 5 The experience from the US-China 2018-19 trade tensions suggests that companies exposed to higher tariffs have lower investment, employment and productivity growth (Amiti et al, 2025; Chor and Li, 2021). 38  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.22.

The P/B ratio compares a bank’s current market capitalisation (i.e. its equity market value) to its accounting book value. A P/B ratio below 1.0 suggests that the market may be undervaluing the bank or that the bank may be slow in marking down impaired assets. Source: Bloomberg; and OECD calculations. A change in investors’ risk appetite could trigger widespread sell-offs of corporate bonds, especially by non-bank financial institutions. Given the low liquidity of high-yield corporate debt, even limited shocks can generate large price corrections, with significant risks of fire sales. Over half of investment-grade corporate bonds are just above the threshold for high-yield status.6If these bonds are downgraded, institutional investors bound by rating-based regulatory requirements will be obliged to sell them. Sales pressures during a downturn could also be exacerbated by pro-cyclical behaviour, especially given relatively high investor concentration in major corporate bond markets (Li and Yu, 2022; Boermans and Veumeulen, 2016), and by redemptions at investment funds. Real estate investment funds are particularly vulnerable to these effects, given the illiquid nature of their assets and the persistently uncertain outlook for the commercial real estate market. Real estate investment trusts experienced a marked decline in performance in April, with the industrial and retail sectors being hit hardest. The high price volatility of crypto-assets and the growing interconnectedness between non-bank financial intermediaries, banks and the crypto-asset market raise substantial risks to financial stability. The market capitalisation of crypto-assets has grown rapidly in recent years, reaching a historical peak of USD 3.7 trillion in mid-December 2024, up from USD 200 billion in January 2020. Subsequent sharp price falls until early April, partly reversed afterwards, suggest elevated valuations and a high sensitivity to repricing in other asset classes (IMF, 2025). The largest single component of the crypto-asset market is Bitcoin, which now represents over two-thirds of market capitalisation, supported by high inflows into Bitcoin exchange\u0002traded products. Crypto-assets often remain less regulated than traditional financial instruments, and data gaps hinder financial stability assessment (Aerts et al. 2025). A particular concern is that price corrections in crypto-assets and potential losses of retail and institutional investors and leveraged investment funds could spill over into other parts of the financial sector and the wider economy amidst forced deleveraging in response to market losses (OECD, 2022a). For instance, redemptions of stablecoins, often 6 At end-2023, 53% of all investment grade bond issuance by non-financial companies was rated BBB.  39 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 reserve-backed by short-term debt instruments, could under certain conditions trigger liquidity runs and pose significant disruption to short-term debt markets (OECD, 2022b). Market concentration and leverage may amplify shocks Higher volatility in equity prices amid concentrated markets remains a concern as there is a greater risk of idiosyncratic shocks spilling over and becoming systemic. The market value of equity and bond markets is often concentrated in a handful of individual stocks or bond issuers, raising the risk of large idiosyncratic sectoral or firm shocks spilling over and becoming systemic.7 A sudden price decline or rise in bond yields could also be amplified by forced asset sales by leveraged and illiquid investment funds, particularly since a small number of funds account for a large share of total corporate bond investment fund assets (OECD, 2025a).8 The growth of passive investment funds (which track the returns of established market benchmarks) may contribute to increased market concentration and stronger co-movements in stock prices, potentially amplifying the impact of negative shocks. Continued inflows into passive funds often disproportionately increase the market capitalisation of the largest companies in equity benchmarks, further concentrating equity markets and heightening their vulnerability to idiosyncratic risks (ECB, 2024). Passive investment funds managed about USD 15 trillion (51.6% of total fund assets) in 2024, up from USD 2 trillion (19.7%) in 2012 (Figure 1.23, Panel A).9 The rise in passive investing has also made the demand for individual stocks more inelastic, potentially leading to higher price volatility and lower liquidity (Haddad et al., 2021). As passive asset managers buy (sell) the whole basket of index constituents in response to fund inflows (outflows) and only adjust their portfolios in line with changes to the index composition, trading commonalities may increase among stocks, with stronger price co-movement. Greater price co-movement amid concentrated markets could threaten systemic stability by increasing the likelihood that many investors face losses simultaneously following firm or sector-specific shocks, triggering waves of redemptions from investment funds and synchronised sell\u0002offs (ESRB, 2019; Chinco and Sammon, 2024; ECB, 2024; OECD, 2025a). 7 Both current levels of concentration and developments over time in equity and corporate bond markets differ substantially across countries. 8 The world’s 100 largest corporate bond funds represent well over a third of global corporate bond assets. 9 Based on aggregate investment fund assets data from Bloomberg. In 2024, the passive share is 59% for equity funds and 38% for fixed income funds. 40  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.23. Global passive investing and use of derivatives by non-bank financial intermediaries have risen Note: Panel A displays total assets under management of investment funds (i.e. mutual and exchange traded funds) globally according to their active or passive investment strategies. Passive portfolio management is a strategy that tracks the returns of a market benchmark. By contrast, active investing aims to outperform a targeted benchmark through discretionary securities selection or trading in anticipation of market turning points. Panel B shows two proxies of leverage through the use of derivatives for non-bank financial intermediaries: the aggregate notional value of over-the-counter) derivative exposures and the ratio of notional amounts to gross market value of over-the-counter derivative exposures (FSB, 2023). Source: Bloomberg; Bank for International Settlements; Financial Stability Board; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/yugqzi The leveraged investment strategies and use of derivatives by some non-bank financial intermediaries could also amplify volatility (Figure 1.23, Panel B). The use of derivatives, particularly by speculative investment funds such as hedge funds, might enhance interconnectedness through complex intermediation chains. An unexpected rise in yields (or equity declines) can lead to rapid unwinding of leveraged trades, with forced selling in an illiquid market prompting further market weakness and margin calls (IOSCO, 2024; FSB, 2024). In early April 2025, following tariff announcements, hedge funds recorded the steepest margin calls since the onset of the pandemic.10 Interconnections between banks and non\u0002bank financial intermediaries could also lead to spillovers to the financial institutions that provide funding to investment funds when the latter face large outflows (OECD, 2024c; BIS, 2025). Financial market volatility also raises risks in emerging-market economies The risk of disruptive capital flows has risen in emerging-market economies. Between October 2024 and January 2025, capital flowed out of emerging-market economies (Figure 1.24, Panel A), partly driven by the relative strength of the US economy. However, this reversed in February and March as fears of a slowdown in the United States rose and the spread between emerging-market and US bond yields widened (Figure 1.24, Panel B). In most emerging-market economies, bilateral US dollar exchange rates have appreciated in 2025, especially since April, with a strong rise in the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso and the Taiwanese dollar, as investors reduced their exposure to US assets. Capital flows are likely to remain volatile as risks of sharp asset repricing and high uncertainty persist. For some emerging market economies, large and sudden capital inflows can lead to strong appreciation and may prove challenging 10 Although volatility in equity and bond markets and trading volumes has been exceptionally high amid forced cash raising, market functioning has remained orderly (BoE, 2025).  41 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 to manage. However, many emerging market economies are at risk of experiencing capital outflows if relative economic prospects and global risk sentiment deteriorate, which could lead to depreciation pressures and higher financing costs. Many emerging-market economies remain vulnerable to debt distress. Sovereign debt levels and borrowing costs have risen significantly in recent years. Government debt as a share of GDP is now higher than in 2019 in almost three quarters of emerging and developing economies (World Bank, 2025). In these circumstances, borrowing is likely to become more challenging. Around 40% of total outstanding high-risk government bonds at the end of 2024 will mature in 2025 and 2026 (Figure 1.25, Panel A), and approximately 20% of all bonds have been issued before 2021, when interest rates were lower (OECD, 2025a). Larger countries and those with a higher credit rating have more developed local bond markets and broader access to finance. In contrast, lower income and high-risk countries rely more on foreign currency borrowing and are susceptible to changes in exchange rates and in risk sentiment. Although low-income countries have less direct exposure to trade with the United States than middle-income countries (Figure 1.25, Panel B), half remain at high risk of distress or are in distress, as many advanced countries have recently reduced foreign aid.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/w9m1kh There are several possible sources of positive surprises There are also various upside risks to the forecasts that would push economic growth higher if they were to occur. The baseline scenario assumes that the recent increases in bilateral tariff rates remain in place throughout 2025 and 2026 in all countries. A reversal of these restrictions, or steps towards a broader agreement to lower tariff barriers from current levels, would boost growth and reduce inflation relative to the baseline (see Figure 1.36 below). Additional structural reforms that lower the economic costs of regulation could also promote stronger growth. In the United States, initiatives are underway to lighten the regulatory burden by eliminating measures that create significant costs for businesses and households without effectively addressing market failures. Agency heads are currently reviewing all regulations under their jurisdiction to identify those that should be rescinded (The White House, 2025). Faced with higher trade barriers, other countries may also be prompted to undertake growth-enhancing structural reforms that promote international competitiveness. New OECD analysis highlights that regulatory reforms in network sectors could produce significant economy-wide gains: if network sector regulations in more regulated countries converged to those in the least-regulated countries, economy-wide labour productivity could rise by 1.7% (Andrews et al., 2025). Similarly, further efforts to harmonise regulations across countries, including within the European Union, or between subnational jurisdictions, such as in Canada or Australia, could support stronger trade and productivity growth. A peaceful resolution of conflicts in Europe and the Middle East could also reduce geopolitical uncertainty and improve confidence, providing a tailwind for spending and investment. Additional public defence spending could also have positive implications for growth, though this is not necessarily the case if financed by cutting other forms of government spending. There may also be an upside risk from the prospect of further declines in oil prices. Global oil supply is expected to outpace demand in the near term, owing both to weaker global demand growth and strong anticipated increases in oil production in several non-OPEC countries including the United States and Canada (IEA, 2025).  43 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Policies Tariff increases complicate monetary policy decisions Policy interest rates have declined further in most advanced economies in recent months, with the notable exception of Japan, where policy accommodation continues to be gradually withdrawn. Central bank balance sheet reductions have also continued, though the United States has slowed down quantitative tightening and Canada has announced plans to bring it to an end. The monetary policy stance remains restrictive in most countries, with forward-looking long-term real interest rates well above pre-pandemic norms and having edged up slightly in recent months, especially in Europe (Figure 1.26, Panel B). In contrast, short-term real rates have fallen, particularly in the United States (Figure 1.26, Panel A) due to an increase in one-year ahead inflation expectations. Figure 1.26. Long-term real interest rates remain high but short-term real rates have declined Note: Based on data up to 27 May 2025. In Panel A, the real short-term interest rates are calculated using nominal one-year government bond yields and one year-ahead inflation expectations by consumers in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom, and by corporates participating in the Tankan Survey in Japan. In Panel B, the real long-term interest rates show 10-year inflation-linked bond yields.

Faced with heightened uncertainty and the likelihood that tariff increases will raise goods price inflation, central banks will need to remain vigilant to ensure that underlying inflation pressures are durably contained. A one-off rise in the relative price of tradeable goods is likely to be accommodated. However, a sequence of such changes, or signs that inflation expectations are rising and rekindling wage pressures in still-tight labour markets, would likely require higher policy rates than would otherwise be the case. Set against this, any associated decline in output would place some general downward pressure on inflation. The balance of these pressures may differ across countries. The downside effects of higher uncertainty and weaker exports are likely to be the main factors in many countries exporting to the United States, but countries raising tariffs will face pressures from sizeable price increases as well as those from softer growth. Provided trade tensions do not intensify further and inflation expectations remain anchored, policy rate reductions can continue in economies where inflation is projected to moderate. Further moderation in nominal wage growth and continued progress in disinflation in services sectors will be critical factors that enable monetary policy easing to proceed smoothly. Under the projected outlook for inflation and GDP growth, policy rate reductions are expected to continue during 2025 and in some cases 2026 in all the major advanced economies other than Japan (Figure 1.27). 44  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 • In the United States, the federal funds rate is projected to remain unchanged through 2025, with rates then being lowered to 3¼-3½% by the end of 2026. Bond holdings are projected to decline further throughout 2025-26, albeit at a slower pace reflecting the lower monthly redemption cap for Treasury securities from April 2025. • In the euro area, policy rate reductions are projected to continue this year, bringing the deposit facility rate to 1¾% by the third quarter of 2025. The decline in Eurosystem bond holdings is expected to continue broadly at the pace observed since early 2025, with no reinvestment of redemptions under either the asset purchase programme or the pandemic emergency purchase programme. • In Japan, the policy rate is projected to increase gradually to 1¼% by the end of 2026, as core inflation stabilises around 2% and a negative output gap gradually closes. The government bond holdings of the Bank of Japan are expected to decline, as the bank’s monthly purchases are reduced by about JPY 400 billion per quarter. Bank of Japan outstanding assets under the loan support programme are also expected to decrease, as new disbursements to stimulate bank lending are scheduled to end in June 2025, and no rollover is to be made after the beginning of 2026. • Reductions in policy rates are projected to continue until the second half of 2025 in Canada and Korea, and until the first half of 2026 in Australia and the United Kingdom. Central bank bond holdings are assumed to decline further in Australia and the United Kingdom. In contrast, renewed asset purchases through term repos followed by outright purchases of treasury bills are expected in Canada, allowing the balance sheet size to eventually stabilise as a share of GDP.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/kbwrnf By the end of 2026, real policy rates are generally projected to be within estimated ranges for real neutral rates (Figure 1.28, Panel A) – the real interest rate at which the policy stance is neither accommodative nor restrictive. Inflation is generally projected to be back or close to target at that time, and growing geopolitical fragmentation increases the odds that it eventually settles at target, rather than dropping below it, as in most of the decade following the global financial crisis. This would lead to sustained higher nominal policy rates than before the pandemic, increasing the room for monetary policy manoeuvre through conventional tools in the event of future downturns. Greater room for manoeuvre could also follow if the future neutral rate was to be higher than what current estimates suggest, for instance due to reforms to  45 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 strengthen productivity and investment, or a larger supply of public debt, to which pressures on public spending (discussed below) and quantitative tightening would contribute (Schnabel, 2025). There is some tentative evidence of a mild rise in neutral rate estimates in major jurisdictions over the past few years (Figure 1.28, Panel B). Figure 1.28. Real policy rates are projected to converge towards neutral levels Note: In Panel A, the projected real policy rate in 2026Q4 is calculated using the nominal policy rate deflated by annual core inflation over the year to 2026Q4 (except for India and Indonesia, where headline inflation is used).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4ditfp Larger debt burdens will bring forward important fiscal policy choices The fiscal projections for 2025-26 are conditional on announced government measures and OECD assessments of current plans (Annex 1.A). Underlying primary balances are expected to worsen, relative to potential GDP, in several advanced OECD economies in 2025. Improvements are projected the following year, yet only a couple of countries are planning substantial fiscal consolidation in 2026. The projected median change in underlying primary balances over the next two years is approximately zero. • In the United States, the structural deficit will remain large with underlying primary spending exceeding revenues by 3.4% of GDP in 2026, and the aggregate general government budget deficit exceeding 8% of GDP. Higher tariff receipts will only partly offset revenues lost due to the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, new tax reductions and weaker economic growth. Efficiency 46  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 measures, including shrinking the federal government workforce, will help slow growth in public expenditure; however, additional spending will reduce net budget savings. • The euro area’s underlying primary deficit is estimated to shrink by 0.3% of GDP between 2024 and 2026. Modest fiscal consolidation will occur this year, associated with the phase-out of energy crisis support, with little change in the fiscal stance projected for 2026. While high-debt countries including France and Italy are planning budget repair, other economies including Germany are expected to have a fiscal expansion in 2026, with increased spending to upgrade infrastructure and military capability (Box 1.3). • Japan’s underlying primary deficit is projected to narrow by 0.9% of potential GDP in the two years to 2026. The projection assumes no supplementary budgets are passed in financial years 2025 and 2026. A corporate tax rate increase in 2026 will help finance new spending. The government is planning to increase outlays on disaster preparedness in addition to expenditure on defence and support for families with children. • Substantial fiscal policy tightening of 1% of potential GDP or more is projected over 2025-26 in Iceland, Israel, Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In contrast, fiscal expansions are projected in Denmark (2.8% of GDP), Norway (0.6% of GDP) and Sweden (0.3% of GDP) with all three Nordic countries raising defence spending. Australia’s underlying primary deficit is expected to expand in the next two years, but little change is projected in Canada. Figure 1.29. Public debt determinants in OECD countries Note: Median values are shown in each year for advanced OECD economies. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/rxcf0i Near-term budget pressures from debt service costs and military spending will be compounded in the long run by persisting costs associated with climate mitigation and adaptation and population ageing. Sizeable primary deficits, elevated interest payments and lower growth (Figure 1.29) will keep public debt ratios high and rising in many OECD economies over 2025-26. For the group of OECD countries, the ratio of gross general government debt to GDP is projected to increase by 2.3 percentage points over the two years to the fourth quarter of 2026 (to 114% of GDP). Increases of 1.5 percentage points in the euro area and 5.9 percentage points in the United States are projected, while Japan’s gross public debt ratio is forecast to decline. Where growth is strong enough to withstand additional fiscal headwinds, consolidation efforts should intensify in high-debt countries as monetary policy becomes less restrictive. Other advanced economies have the fiscal room for manoeuvre to increase public spending for some years while running down surpluses or borrowing to finance larger deficits. Amid heightened geopolitical tensions, many countries are fast-tracking defence investments to bolster national security (Box 1.3). Such spending will  47 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 add to debt burdens in some countries in the second half of this decade. In contrast, some heavily indebted countries – including France, Italy and the United Kingdom – are pressing ahead with budget repair to avoid the risk of abrupt and painful fiscal corrections later (Figure 1.30). In the near term, governments may also face new calls for additional support in countries confronted with higher trade costs. A first line of defence is to allow automatic stabilisers to operate fully. Targeted, temporary and well-designed support measures (Hemmerlé et al., 2023) could, if necessary, help cushion the initial impact of liquidity shocks felt by companies. Protracted budgetary support to firms facing a lasting loss of external competitiveness should be avoided. Figure 1.30.

Higher defence spending: economic and public finance implications Defence spending has increased recently in many OECD countries after declining in the three decades following the end of the Cold War. This is evident in Europe, where military expenditure has outpaced growth in GDP since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and also in Israel. Relative to the size of their economies, EU countries in Central and Eastern Europe have invested particularly heavily in their armed forces (Figure 1.31). Poland and the Baltic states have set ambitious goals for future spending, pledging to lift military expenditure to 5% of GDP in years to come. High targets for defence spending, often well above recent outlays, have also been declared in Czechia and the Nordic countries as well as in France and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.32, Panel A). In Germany, where defence spending increased from relatively low levels a few years ago to reach 1.9% of GDP in 2024, constitutional hurdles to higher spending have been removed (see below). While legislated measures leave major spending challenges to future governments in some countries, ongoing defence expenditure is trending higher, in Europe and also in several Asian OECD countries, notably Japan. In contrast, the United States does not have long-term plans to raise the GDP share of its military spending, which is already higher than in most other OECD countries. Few countries have released detailed information about their medium-term defence spending plans. However, major investments in equipment and infrastructure are considered necessary in many countries to address capability gaps. For instance, European Commission estimates suggest such investments by EU member states could be worth a total of EUR 500 billion over the next decade (1.1% of 2024 GDP). 1 48  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 While defence investment has increased more rapidly than total defence spending in recent years, personnel costs – a major component of government consumption – typically still make up a larger share of OECD countries’ total defence budgets (39% on average in 2023, compared with 24% for investment).2 Higher defence spending will add to budgetary pressures in many economies. In some, consolidation of other government outlays is expected to create room for higher defence expenditure. This is reflected in budget plans in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland and the United Kingdom. Most of these countries also project budget support from higher revenues. However, few OECD countries have managed to finance large increases in defence outlays in recent years without running down fiscal surpluses or increasing budget deficits. This aligns with historical experience, as substantial additional government borrowing often accompanies the first phases of military build-ups before countries raise taxes (Marzian and Trebesch, 2025). Over the next two years, budget positions are expected to deteriorate in many countries planning higher public spending on defence. Figure 1.31.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/lk7t1x Fiscal rules are changing to accommodate higher defence spending. In Germany, constitutional reform has lifted constraints on borrowing for defence spending ahead of major investments over the coming years. Sweden has departed from a longstanding target of a budget surplus to shift to a balanced budget rule from 2027, enabling higher military expenditure. In parallel to national reforms, the European Commission has invited EU member states able to withstand additional fiscal pressure without threatening debt sustainability to make use of national escape clauses in the Stability and Growth Pact (European Commission, 2025a). Recognising Europe’s “extraordinary” security challenge, national escape clauses – once activated by the Council – would allow deviations from medium-term budget plans of up to 1.5% of GDP over the next four years, with increased spending to go only on defence.3As at the end of April, 16 member states had decided to request the activation of the national escape clause. 4 In countries with limited fiscal space, financial market pressure may curb defence-spending ambitions, even if escape clauses are activated and EU loans help fund defence investments.5 This constraint may be relevant for countries already under the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure, a group that includes France,  49 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Poland and Italy, respectively the Union’s second, third and fourth biggest defence spenders in absolute terms based on data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI, 2025). Sustaining higher military expenditure for a long period of time, or even permanently, could force higher\u0002debt countries to confront hard policy trade-offs. While increased borrowing may enable governments to finance large military investments during a transition period, countries unable to sufficiently curb growth in non-military spending may ultimately have to consider raising tax burdens further (Figure 1.32, Panel B). A challenge in monitoring the use of escape clauses will be to ensure that other types of spending, for instance non-military foreign aid, are not reclassified as defence expenditure to circumvent fiscal rules. Gains to actual or potential growth could help offset the fiscal costs of defence spending but are uncertain and will vary from country to country. In the near term, higher government final expenditure on defence will contribute to demand, employment and incomes, especially if it is financed by borrowing. Some studies suggest fiscal multipliers from military expenditure could be relatively high in advanced economies, with little or no crowding out of private demand in some circumstances (Sheremirov and Spirovska, 2022). Larger near-term output effects are more likely in low-debt countries; when monetary policy accommodates higher government spending; and in countries with established local defence industries (such as France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom). Recent analyses of the possible economic impact of higher military expenditure in Europe have produced estimates ranging from a 0.5 to 1.5% boost to Europe-wide GDP for defence spending increases of 1.5% of GDP (Ilzetzki, 2025; European Commission, 2025b), with potentially larger effects for economies in recession and if monetary policy responses are limited (Ilzetzki, 2025). In some countries, such as Germany, there are possibilities for automotive manufacturers to produce defence equipment or for defence producers to repurpose factories, buy equipment or hire workers let go by ailing car producers. However, many countries contemplating higher military spending, including some EU member states, have few or no major local producers of military equipment. In the last four years, 64% of arms imports by European NATO states came from the United States (SIPRI, 2025). The net output effects of defence spending might also differ by type of spending.6 Defence infrastructure projects (for instance, building airfields, docks or storage facilities) or spending on equipment might be associated with relatively high multipliers if, in addition to increased public sector investment, they generate domestic private sector activity and jobs, and rely mainly on locally-sourced materials. Government spending on the armed forces (for instance, additions to military personnel) also contributes to domestic output – directly through public consumption and indirectly via household consumption – and is likely to have larger net effects in economies below full employment.7 Efficient procurement will be essential to support realised improvements in military capability and may help foster innovation spillovers. In Europe, coordinated purchasing between countries should be pursued alongside steps to improve competition and reduce fragmentation in the defence market (Wolff et al., 2025). To the extent that European countries are able to source defence equipment, inputs or services from each other, and stretched availability of supplies does not raise costs, regional multipliers from defence spending could exceed those in individual European countries. Provided inflationary effects are small, positive output effects could be larger, and distributed more broadly across countries, if closely connected economies simultaneously expand their defence spending. Efficient joint procurement could also enhance long-run cross-border spillovers from investment in defence research and development.8 Historical experience suggests increased defence R&D could support higher private sector productivity (Ilzetzki, 2025), provided increased employment of skilled workers in defence does not exacerbate skills shortages in other industries. Should military spending reallocate labour and capital to less efficient uses, aggregate productivity could be lower (OECD, 2025c). 50  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.32. Ambitious military spending goals could force tough fiscal policy choices Note: Goals refer to announced defence spending objectives, whether or not backed by concrete plans, timeframes or legislated measures. Where the goal is expressed as a range (for example, 5-6% of GDP), the bottom of the range is shown. For Germany, newly passed reforms exclude military spending above 1% of GDP from the calculation of the country's debt limit. In the coming years, German defence spending is expected to rise above the current 2% of GDP commitment, but the new government’s full plans are not yet available. Tax revenue data are for 2023.

Relatively few studies of multipliers examine the effects of different types of government spending. Findings are mixed among empirical studies comparing multipliers for government investment and consumption. For example, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) find near-term output effects of US government investment (a multiplier over 2) that are higher than those for US government consumption (roughly 0.5). Boehm (2020), in a study of OECD countries, finds the opposite holds for short-lived investment spending shocks (ones substantially dissipating within two years) - government investment multipliers are found to be near zero, reflecting lower private investment, while government consumption multipliers are higher (around 0.8). The US study of Haug and Sznajderska (2024) finds that multipliers for government consumption and investment are not statistically significantly different (and around 0.5). 7. A recent study of Central and Eastern European countries finds relatively high multipliers on military personnel expenditures (exceeding unity two years after a spending shock), which is argued to reflect private consumption by military staff (Olejnik, 2023). As in some other papers, multipliers for military expenditures are found to be higher in recessions. 8. Steinwender, Van Reenen and Moretti (2019) study spillovers from defence to private sector R&D within and across countries. With debt burdens already high in many countries, a step-up in fiscal pressure brings forward hard policy choices. Many of the costs of maintaining larger armed forces, mitigating climate change, adapting to warmer climates, and supporting older populations will coincide and persist for some time. These  51 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 pressures will exacerbate structural budget imbalances that already exist. To keep public debt sustainable, and preserve buffers to respond to future shocks, countries should pursue fiscal reforms alongside other priorities. Many advanced economies are looking to curb public expenditure, with reductions in public investment, green infrastructure financing, foreign aid, basic research or cuts to government employment often treated as potential sources of savings. While improving the budget balance in the short run, measures of this sort may erode public service capacity, withdraw support from those most in need and set back long-term objectives, including the need for strong economic growth amid a transition to net zero emissions. Systematic and regular spending reviews and the adoption of new digital technologies could help to improve public sector efficiency while preserving essential public programmes, and limit harm to potential growth by reallocating resources efficiently as priorities shift. Effective targeting of social benefits and pension systems that encourage longer working lives could also help to contain spending (OECD, 2024b; OECD, 2024c). Countries differ markedly in the resources they devote to old age and other social protection expenditure (Figure 1.33), differences that are only partly explained by relative incomes and demographics (Barnes et al., 2025). Many recently announced and ongoing tax reforms – including measures to broaden consumption tax bases by reducing distortive tax expenditures (Iceland), raise taxation of carbon emissions (Ireland, Portugal) and improve tax collection (Bulgaria, Greece) – could, if carried forward, strengthen structural budget positions while limiting costs to sustainable growth. Other current revenue raising measures, including tariff increases in the United States and direct tax measures in the United Kingdom could, however, be partially offset by adverse impacts on activity. Revenue-raising reforms should generally aim to shift tax systems over time towards less-distortive taxes with fewer exemptions, as it is difficult to alleviate debt burdens without strong economic growth (Pina et al., 2025). There is scope in several advanced economies to raise proportionally more revenue from consumption, environmental and property taxes while relying less heavily on taxing wages (OECD, 2024b; OECD, 2024c). Medium-term planning is essential to preserve or free up resources for strategically important projects, many of which will weigh on the public finances. Such plans can help avoid excessive debt accumulation and reduce uncertainty about the conduct of fiscal policy. Fiscal rules remain important for the sound management of public finances, even if subject to deviations through escape clauses or other flexibility mechanisms – for instance, to support productive investment or higher defence spending (Box 1.3). Independent fiscal institutions can also play a useful role in assessing the impact of proposed policy changes, overseeing countries’ return to quantitative budget limits, and communicating the need to keep justified departures temporary. 52  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.33.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/o0hzwi Emerging-market economies should strive to reduce inflation and fiscal deficits Policy rate reductions have continued across many emerging-market economies in recent quarters and have started in India, where inflation pressures have gradually abated, creating greater scope for supporting the economy. However, rate reductions have slowed down or been halted since early 2025 in several countries, especially in Latin America, partly due to the persistence of inflation pressures or exchange rate developments. Amid strong growth and rising inflation in Brazil, the policy rate has been raised four times since December 2024 over concerns about a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. In Türkiye, after three consecutive policy rate reductions since December 2024, the policy rate was raised again in April to lower risks of a renewed rise in inflation pressures. Given low inflation, key policy interest rates and reserve requirements have been lowered further in China. Scope still exists to lower policy rates in most emerging-market economies over the next 18 months, but policy decisions are likely to remain finely balanced. While the projected slowdown of global trade will tend to weaken economic activity, higher tariffs imposed by some countries are likely to put some upward pressure on producer costs worldwide, and higher policy uncertainty may heighten risk aversion in financial markets. Careful calibration of monetary policy will be essential to keep inflation expectations well anchored and to avoid disruptive capital outflows. If necessary, rate reductions may need to be slowed, or even reversed temporarily, to ensure price stability. The expected pace of policy rate reductions is projected to vary across countries (Figure 1.34): • China is expected to maintain an accommodative monetary stance to support activity as inflation is likely to remain low, despite some upward pressures from the additional tariffs on trade with the United States.  53 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 • In Colombia and Mexico, where policy rates remain elevated, reductions are expected to continue steadily until late 2026, with rates being lowered to 7% and 6.25%, respectively, still somewhat above or close to the upper bound of neutral level estimates. Further small rate reductions are also expected in Chile. • In India, policy rate reductions are expected to cease by end-2025, while in Indonesia modest rate reductions are projected to continue until late 2026, with inflation projected to return to target and policy rates to broadly neutral levels. The policy rate is already close to neutral level estimates in South Africa where rate reductions are expected to cease by end-2025. • In Türkiye, where inflation is projected to decline to around 15% by the end of 2026, policy rate reductions are expected to resume over 2025 and 2026. • In Brazil, given persistent inflation pressures, policy rates are projected to increase further in the coming months to 15%, before a gradual reduction starting from early 2026.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/cd4rp3 Recent fiscal developments have varied across emerging-market economies. In 2024, fiscal deficits were recorded in most emerging-market economies and rose in many of them (Figure 1.35, Panel A). The expansion of fiscal support in China and the new nationwide free school meal programme in Indonesia weighed on budget balances. In Colombia, the fiscal deficit increased as tax revenue falls outpaced spending cuts, and in Mexico as oil revenues fell. Fiscal balances also worsened in Bulgaria and Romania, due to continued spending pressures in social expenditure and public sector wages. In contrast, the Brazilian fiscal balance improved in 2024, partly due to one-off revenue measures. Budget balances also improved in India and South Africa. 54  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Based on announced policy plans, fiscal balances are projected to improve in most emerging-market economies in 2025-26 despite slowing growth. Türkiye is expected to continue consolidating as higher consumption taxes increase revenue and public investment is reduced further. Fiscal deficits in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru are projected to narrow as governments restrain spending and boost tax revenues, although they are projected to fall short of their fiscal targets in Colombia and Peru. India is also expected to consolidate further, partly by streamlining subsidies. In contrast, the fiscal deficit in Brazil is projected to persist in 2025, as there is limited political appetite for raising additional tax revenue, and to worsen in 2026 as growth slows. Fiscal balances are generally expected to improve in most countries in 2026, but the pace of improvement is projected to be relatively modest (Figure 1.35, Panels B and C). Emerging-market economies face a challenging environment. Amid rising debt and interest payments, they remain vulnerable to rapid shifts in risk sentiment and higher borrowing costs. They need to adjust to the changing global trade environment while preserving investor confidence and avoiding disorderly capital outflows. Countries should strive to meet fiscal consolidation targets, while ensuring that any support to help the economy adjust to changes in trade arrangements is targeted and temporary. In the medium to long-term, countries will need to reconcile fiscal sustainability with higher investment in human and physical capital, including for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and with steps to reinforce social safety nets. Addressing these trade-offs will require fiscal-structural reforms, such as enhancing spending efficiency, including by reducing untargeted subsidies, and improving revenue collection through curbing informality and broadening tax bases. Furthermore, strengthening fiscal institutions, such as fiscal rules and fiscal councils, might also lower financing costs and improve credibility (Alnafrah and Bogatov, 2025; Caldera Sanchez et al., 2024).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/2axzin  55 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Structural policy reforms need to be enhanced to support trade and boost investment Governments need to find ways of working together within the global trading system to reduce policy uncertainty and avoid a ratcheting up of retaliatory trade barriers between countries. Countries should also not lose sight of the opportunities for potential benefits from collectively agreeing to lower the current tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services. In an illustrative scenario in which all countries act to lower their average effective tariff rates by 1½ percentage points (relative to those assumed in the baseline projections), global output would be raised by close to 0.3% by the third year and global inflation reduced by close to ¼ percentage point on average in the first three years (Figure 1.36; OECD, 2025b).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/ci0d7h Efforts to prevent further trade fragmentation should be coupled with reforms that strengthen the resilience of supply chains, including by encouraging firms to diversify both suppliers and buyers. Diversification would be aided by aligned regulatory standards on key intermediate production inputs between countries. This includes ongoing efforts to harmonise regulations between countries in the European Union. There is also additional scope to better align regulatory standards between sub-national jurisdictions. For example, in Canada, further eliminating differences in product and labour regulations and technical standards between provinces would better allow goods and services to flow to where they are most needed. Reforming trade facilitation procedures could also reduce trade costs and support greater diversification and depth in trade. Many countries have recently improved such procedures, by enhancing cooperation between border agencies both domestically and across countries. OECD estimates suggest that trade costs have declined by up to 5% over the last decade due to improvements in the efficiency of border processes, with the strongest effects in lower-income and lower middle-income economies (OECD 2025d; Figure 1.37). Further ambitious reforms to border agency co-operation, efforts to enhance the implementation of regulatory frameworks for trade facilitation, and to automate and simplify procedures could reduce delays and compliance costs and improve supply chain efficiency, potentially reducing trade costs by up to a further 12 percentage points (OECD, 2025d). Such improvements would help to boost the ability of exporters to find new markets and deepen existing trade relationships. 56  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.37.

Source: OECD (2025d). StatLink 2https://stat.link/rdza3c Lower barriers to trade in services would also promote trade flows. The OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index highlights the continued challenges of regulatory fragmentation and uneven conditions in access to services markets across countries (Figure 1.38, Panel A). This creates an uneven playing field which hampers trade in services as well as goods, because many services, such as logistics, are also crucial for global trade in goods. The pace and magnitude of services sector reforms were moderate in 2024 compared to 2023, with higher restrictions in all 22 services sectors and meaningful trade liberalisation in only a handful of sectors (OECD, 2025e). Ambitious policy reforms reducing services trade restrictiveness, equivalent to closing half the distance between current and best practice, could result in trade costs falling by around 11% in services sectors (OECD, 2024d; Figure 1.38, Panel B), with additional productivity benefits for manufacturers using services. This would be a significant potential offset to higher tariffs. Further efforts to support the digital delivery of services could also yield benefits. Raising digital connectivity between countries can support trade in goods as well as in services. However, digital services policy remains fragmented and increasingly restrictive. The OECD Digital Services Trade Restrictiveness Index shows that rising trade restrictions on digitally enabled services between 2014 and 2023 particularly affected access to communication infrastructure and connectivity (OECD, 2025e). Governments need to find an appropriate balance between safeguards and ensuring adequate competition in digital services. Trade tends to rise fastest when policies to lower trade facilitation costs are undertaken alongside significant improvements in the digital regulatory framework, highlighting the importance of carefully designed reforms to maximise the benefits for trade performance and competitiveness.  57 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.38.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/3axqg6 Rising protectionism and weak growth prospects also reinforce the need for governments to promote productivity and improve living standards through undertaking ambitious structural policy reforms. As discussed in Chapter 2, a strong focus should be policies to promote business investment that supports innovation and stronger growth in labour productivity. Investment prospects are now being damaged by the significant rise in policy uncertainty and this follows a marked slowdown in the pace of business investment in many economies since the financial crisis (Figure 1.39, Panel A). Only a small portion of this investment slowdown can be explained by weaker demand growth. Firms across OECD economies have increasingly invested in digital assets (Figure 1.39, Panel B), but the impact on net investment rates has been more than offset by weaker growth in traditional forms of capital investment and higher depreciation. Housing and public investment have also slowed in many countries, contributing to deteriorating housing affordability and public infrastructure. 58  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.39. Business investment gaps are large across OECD economies Note: In Panel A, the investment gap is calculated as the shortfall relative to predicted investment from a simple accelerator model that relates real business investment growth to its own lag and to current real output growth. Predicted real business investment is calculated from 2008 to 2023 as the fitted values from a model using actual growth rates of GDP and lagged investment. The overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend in 2023 is then decomposed into a part that is explained by the model, interpreted as demand (calculated as trend investment minus predicted investment) and an unexplained part, or “gap” (calculated as predicted investment minus actual investment, as a per cent of predicted investment). In Panel B, ICT machinery includes both computer hardware and telecommunications equipment. ‘Other’ includes Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/0b6hm1 Weakening business investment has reflected structural factors in many economies. Despite rising profits, firms have shied away from fixed capital investment in favour of accumulating financial assets and returning funds to shareholders (OECD, 2025a). Across the OECD, the corporate sector has moved from being a net borrower to a net lender on aggregate since the financial crisis. This has coincided with an increase in required rates of return on investment, with the gap between the hurdle rates that businesses apply to investment decisions and capital costs having widened across countries (Figure 1.40). Identifying the factors behind sticky hurdle rates is fundamental for policymakers aiming to revive business investment growth. Elevated uncertainty, declining business dynamism and perceived difficulties in funding future investment in intangible assets are all factors that have been identified as playing a role in OECD economies (see Chapter 2). Against this backdrop, there are a range of structural policy reforms that can help revive business investment growth (see Chapters 2 and 3). Efforts to assuage policy uncertainty are key, as they would allow businesses to reduce the risk-premia they incorporate in hurdle rates. This is relevant across various policy dimensions, with specific approaches including conducting trade policy through a transparent and rules-based approach, outlining and implementing credible fiscal strategies, reducing complexity and improving transparency in regulatory policies and taking further credible steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  59 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 1.40.

Source: Gormsen and Huber (2023). StatLink 2https://stat.link/0tifmy Policies that promote business dynamism would also incentivise firms to innovate and invest as they strive to stay ahead of competitors. In many nascent industries, such as artificial intelligence, measures are often needed to lower barriers to firm entry and guard against firms building monopolistic positions. Given signs of reduced business dynamism in OECD economies (Calligaris, et. al. 2024), efforts to reduce the costs of regulations to businesses are needed. For example, there is significant scope to lower barriers to firm entry in capital-intensive network sectors, with new OECD simulations suggesting that deregulation in more highly regulated economies towards the regulatory levels of their least regulated peers is associated with an increase in the potential capital stock of up to 1.5% (Andrews et. al. 2025). Many countries also still lack adequate rules guaranteeing the transparency and accountability of lobbying activities. This regulatory void can benefit incumbents and well-funded corporations, enabling them to shape rules and the implementation of these rules in their favour at the expense of new entrants. Less punishing insolvency regimes and less prescriptive land use regulations are other key policy areas for promoting business dynamism, through their influence in supporting entrepreneurship and the growth of new businesses. Ensuring the availability of skilled labour will also be important for the expansion of high potential firms, both through a focus on lifelong learning policies and structural reforms that lower frictions in labour markets, such as reducing the prevalence of unnecessary non-compete clauses. Measures that facilitate better access to finance, especially for funding hard-to-collateralise intangible assets, can promote current investment spending by reducing the need for firms to save for future intangible investment spending. Improved depth of capital markets would support a more diverse range of funding options and promote competition between lenders. In Europe, making further progress on implementing the Savings and Investments Union will be important in this regard. Developing certain segments of capital markets that are more well-suited to funding intangibles than traditional banking systems may require some public financial support as well as regulatory changes. While remaining attuned to potential implications for financial stability, examples include adjusting regulatory restrictions on the investment activities of pension providers, public investment in venture capital markets and reducing administrative requirements on fintech lenders. 60  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 References Aerts, S., A.

Policy and other assumptions underlying the projections Fiscal policy settings for 2025-26 are based as closely as possible on legislated tax and spending provisions and are consistent with the growth, inflation and wage projections. Where government plans have been announced but not legislated, they are incorporated if it is deemed clear that they will be implemented in a shape close to that announced. It is assumed that EU countries generally adopt fiscal policy adjustments which are consistent with the reformed Stability and Growth Pact, apart from those member states where planned fiscal expansions are likely to require the activation of national escape clauses. Projections for the EU countries account for spending financed by the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) grants and loans, based on expert judgments about the distribution of spending across years and different expenditure categories and informed by officially announced plans where available. NGEU grants are assumed to be budget neutral, and increase both capital tax and transfers receipts and government expenditure. In addition, positive net one-offs are added in order to reflect the discretionary stimulus associated with those grants, as measured by changes in underlying primary balances. For monetary policy, the assumed path of policy interest rates and unconventional measures represents the most likely outcome, conditional upon the OECD projections of activity and inflation. This may differ from the stated path of the monetary authorities. In the euro area, 10-year sovereign spreads relative to Germany are assumed to remain constant over the projection period at levels close to those observed in the first half of May. The projections assume unchanged exchange rates from those prevailing on 9 May 2025: one US dollar equals JPY 145.2, EUR 0.89 (or equivalently one euro equals USD 1.13) and 7.24 renminbi. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is assumed to remain constant at USD 60 until the end of 2026. The TTF natural gas price is assumed to remain constant at EUR 35 MW/h until the end of 2026. Other commodity prices are assumed to be constant over the projection period at their average levels from April 2025. A technical assumption is made that the tariffs being applied as of mid-May 2025 remain in place throughout 2025 and 2026. It is also assumed that some disruptions to shipping in the Red Sea persist through 2025 and 2026. The cut-off date for information used in the projections is May 27, 2025. OECD quarterly projections are on a seasonal and working-day-adjusted basis for selected key variables. This implies that differences between adjusted and unadjusted annual data may occur, though these in general are quite small. In some countries, official forecasts of annual figures do not include working-day adjustments. Even when official forecasts do adjust for working days, the size of the adjustment may in some cases differ from that used by the OECD.  65 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Summary Weak investment has weighed on potential output growth since the global financial crisis (GFC), despite historically low financing costs and strong corporate profitability. Subdued aggregate demand and elevated uncertainty have dampened real business investment, but explain only around half of the investment shortfall since the GFC. In parallel, structural shifts, particularly the growing importance of digital assets and evolving corporate behaviour, have become more prominent. As economies have transitioned toward more digital and knowledge-intensive production – accelerated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – businesses have increasingly allocated investment toward software, data, computing hardware, and research and development. Firms have also channelled a lower share of their retained earnings and borrowed funds into productive investment, while requiring persistently high rates of return, or ‘hurdle rates’. These trends may be associated with underlying forces that restrain business investment and dynamism, including declining competitive pressures and the challenges in financing intangible investments. At the same time, residential investment has struggled to keep pace with strong housing demand, contributing to a steady erosion in affordability over the past few decades. Public investment – although showing some recent signs of recovery – has also been weak in many countries for an extended period. Against this backdrop, the chapter outlines policy approaches to support a revival in investment, including by reducing policy uncertainty, strengthening macroeconomic stability to support growth and advancing structural reforms to reinvigorate business dynamism. Policies that foster competition and improve access to finance are needed to unlock new investment opportunities and boost innovation in many countries. Reforms to ease land-use and planning restrictions and rental market regulations would help expand residential investment and improve affordability. Finally, high-quality public investment – particularly in energy security and green and digital infrastructure, research and development, health, and education – is needed in many economies and can help boost productivity and long-term economic growth. A prolonged period of weak investment has weighed on potential output growth Underlying growth prospects have weakened considerably over the past two decades, both in advanced and emerging-market economies. Weak growth in the capital stock has been an important factor behind the slowdown in potential output per capita growth in many countries, alongside a decline in multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth. Potential output per capita growth fell by 0.8 percentage points in the median advanced country and 0.9 percentage points in the median emerging-market economy between the 2002-2008 period and 2024. Weaker growth in capital per worker accounted for 0.5 percentage points of the decline in potential GDP per capita growth in the median advanced country, and 0.3 percentage points in the median emerging-market country. The slowdown in capital accumulation has weighed on potential growth across nearly all countries (Figure 2.1, Panel A), including those with relatively strong overall growth performance, such as India and China. 2. Reigniting investment for more resilient growth 66  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The aggregate slowdown in capital accumulation masks notable cross-country differences (Figure 2.1, Panel B). In the advanced economies, capital stock growth has been particularly weak in Japan, Italy, Greece and Portugal during the past 15 years. The United States has observed steadier growth, albeit still below levels observed in the period before the GFC. Capital stocks in emerging-market economies have grown slightly faster on average than in advanced economies, reflecting greater investment needs. Nevertheless, some major emerging-market economies, such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, have seen weak capital stock growth, while others, such as Chile, have experienced high growth rates, but still a marked slowdown in capital stock growth over the past two decades. Figure 2.1. Weak capital accumulation has held back growth Note: Panel A: Other factors include changes in labour utilisation and multi-factor productivity.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/guel8r  67 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The slowdown in capital accumulation largely reflects the lasting impact of two major shocks – the GFC and the COVID-19 pandemic – which led to notable declines in real investment from which most economies have recovered only partially. Total real investment, which measures the volume of gross fixed capital formation across the economy, contracted sharply during the GFC as economic growth weakened and financing conditions tightened. The subsequent recovery was relatively modest. Investment declined again during the pandemic, rebounding only partially thereafter, with other events such as Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and rising energy prices also weighing on capital formation. As a result, aggregate real investment volumes across advanced countries remained approximately 22% below their pre-GFC trend and 7% below the pre-COVID trend at end-2024 (Figure 2.2, Panel A). An investment shortfall is also evident in emerging markets, though it developed more gradually, as investment was less affected by the GFC than in advanced economies. Investment in emerging-market economies on average is estimated to be approximately 33% below the pre-GFC trend, although it is slightly above the pre-COVID trend due to recent robust growth in India and Indonesia (Figure 2.2, Panel B). This investment slowdown has been widespread across countries. Most have continued to see weak capital formation in recent years, with a few exceptions, such as the United States, India and Indonesia, where investment growth has been relatively strong. Figure 2.2. Real investment remains below the pre-GFC and pre-pandemic trends in many economies Real total investment Note: Real investment across 33 advanced economies and 13 emerging-market economies (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Romania, South Africa, Thailand, and Türkiye).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/i378g1 While the ratio of gross investment to GDP has risen in recent years in some countries, net investment - the addition to the capital stock after accounting for depreciation - remains weak across OECD countries. Since the pre-GFC period, average net investment rates across the OECD have declined by over 0.9 percentage points of GDP, from 2.5 to 1.6 per cent of GDP for the median country, with the fall in net investment strongest in the euro area. The overall decline in net investment has been primarily driven by the drop in business net investment - the largest share of total investment – though reductions in residential and public net investment have also contributed (Figure 2.3). The declines primarily reflect weakness in underlying investment volumes. The fall in prices of investment goods relative to overall prices played a significant role in the lower net investment-to-GDP ratios of the 1990s and early 2000s, but relative prices have since broadly stabilised in the post-GFC period. 68  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.3.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/i0l8cf Business investment has been held back by subdued demand, elevated uncertainty and structural factors Business investment, which accounts for over 60% of total investment in the average OECD country, has remained comparatively weak in most economies for which data are available. Notable exceptions are the United States and France, where business investment has grown more robustly. The weakness has been widespread, affecting most sectors (Figure 2.4, Panel A) and both large and small firms (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). Changes in the sectoral composition – such as an increasing share of less investment-intensive sectors such as services and a declining share of more capital-intensive manufacturing – seem to have played only a limited role. Instead, the decline in investment has been largely driven by within-sector dynamics (Figure 2.4, Panel B).  69 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.4. Business investment has been weak across sectors Note: In Panel A, the graph plots the coefficient β𝑠from the regression 𝑖𝑐,𝑡 𝑠 = α𝑐 𝑠 + β𝑠 × 𝑡 + ϵ𝑐,𝑡 𝑠 for each sector s, showing the average annual change in the net investment rate over the period 1997-2021, expressed in percentage points.

The sample covers the period from 1997 to 2021, and countries shown in Panel B, with the net investment ratio defined as gross fixed capital formation minus consumption of fixed capital, divided by value added, all in current prices. In Panel B, the graph presents a shift-share analysis for all countries with available data. This analysis decomposes changes in the investment rate into two components: a within-industry effect (reflecting investment changes within sector) and a between-industry effect (reflecting investment shifts in sectoral composition), following the methodology of Autor and Salomons (2018). Source: OECD National Accounts database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/uxm0f4 Aggregate demand accounts for part of the weakness but investment ‘gaps’ remain One key factor contributing to the weakness in business investment relative to earlier trends is more subdued growth in aggregate demand. In many countries, real output fell sharply following both the GFC and the pandemic, and recovered only partially relative to its pre-crisis trend. Corporate investment is closely linked to output growth, as stronger demand incentivises firms to expand capacity. Empirical analysis based on an accelerator model suggests that weak aggregate demand is an important factor explaining business investment performance. Yet, it accounts for only around one-third of the overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend (Figure 2.5, Panel A) on average, for the 17 countries with available data. In contrast, the accelerator model suggests that business investment was broadly in line with output growth in the period leading up to the financial crisis. The remaining shortfall may be viewed as an investment ‘gap’, defined as the shortfall in investment not attributable to output developments. This investment ‘gap’ is around 17% of the predicted investment level on average and is even larger in some countries – exceeding 30% in Australia, Korea, and the Netherlands (Figure 2.5, Panel B). 70  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Investment gaps have widened over time, pointing to the growing importance of non-demand factors in explaining weak investment. In the immediate wake of the GFC (2008-2011), the gap was small, suggesting that demand effects accounted for most of the investment weakness, although credit supply and debt overhangs may also have contributed. Between 2012 and 2019, the gap widened gradually, and from 2020 onward, the COVID-19 shock contributed to a further increase. On average, developments since 2020 account for roughly one-quarter of the unexplained slowdown in investment. The impact of the pandemic on the investment gap has been particularly sizeable in some countries, such as Belgium, Denmark and Sweden (Figure 2.5, Panel B). Figure 2.5. Business investment ‘gaps’ are large across OECD economies Decomposition of shortfalls in real business investment compared to pre-GFC trend Note: The investment gap is calculated as the shortfall relative to predicted investment from a simple accelerator model that relates real business investment growth to its own lag and to current real output growth (Annex 2.A). Predicted real business investment is calculated from 2008 to 2023 as the fitted values from the model using actual growth rates of GDP and lagged investment. The overall shortfall in real business investment relative to the pre-GFC trend in 2023 is then decomposed into a part that is explained by the model, interpreted as demand (calculated as trend investment minus predicted investment) and an unexplained part, or ‘gap’ (calculated as predicted investment minus actual investment, as a per cent of predicted investment). The country sample includes 17 OECD countries for which data on real business investment are available. Panel A shows the results for the OECD aggregate, calculated as a weighted average of the countries in Panel B using GDP PPP weights. Panel B shows investment gaps in per cent of predicted investment, for countries with available data. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/vjcbw1 Investment ‘gaps’ cannot be fully explained by the cost of capital, company valuations and profitability Business investment gaps have opened up despite a marked decline in the user cost of capital (UCC) across most economies. The UCC, which captures the cost of financing and maintaining capital –factoring in borrowing costs, relative prices, taxes, and depreciation – has trended downward steadily over the past few decades until the recent moves to tighten monetary policy (Figure 2.6, Panel A). Borrowing costs dropped to historically low levels following the monetary policy easing in response to the GFC, and while they have risen more recently, they remain well below long-term averages (Figure 2.6, Panel B). Effective corporate tax rates have also declined, with several OECD countries having reduced the main statutory rate (Figure 2.6, Panel C), and changes to tax provisions have further lowered the effective cost of capital in some countries. Simultaneously, the price of investment goods relative to overall output prices fell throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, largely due to sustained improvements in the quality and efficiency of ICT-related capital (Figure 2.6, Panel C).  71 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 At the same time, corporate valuations have remained favourable to higher investment. When the ratio of a firm's market valuation to the replacement cost of its assets (Tobin’s Q) is above one, markets expect firms can earn returns on new investment that exceed investment costs. Firm-level data from listed companies in a subset of OECD countries indicate that Tobin’s Q has remained above this threshold since the GFC. In the United States and some Scandinavian countries, valuations have risen strongly in recent years, whereas valuations have been flat or increased only gradually in most European and other advanced economies (Figure 2.6, Panel D).1 Figure 2.6. The cost of capital has fallen and company valuations have held up Note: Panel A: The user cost of capital UCC is calculated using the relative price of investment, the real interest rate based on the 10-year government bond yield and 10-year ahead inflation expectations from professional forecasts, the depreciation rate, the statutory corporate tax rate and the share of debt in corporate liabilities (debt plus equity). Panel C: The relative price of investment is measured as the ratio of the investment and GDP deflators. Panel D: Tobin's Q is calculated as the sum of market capitalisation and liabilities, minus common equity, divided by market capitalisation using Worldscope data.

Median values are shown. In Panel D, for Europe, the median is calculated using data from a subset of countries with larger stock markets, covering Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/bpkizw 1 Differences in the valuation of firms in advanced economies and their US counterparts may be driven by several factors. These include the traditionally stronger institutional framework in the United States —including corporate governance standards and financial market infrastructure—greater market capacity to absorb global risks, and higher expectations for future investment returns (La Porta et al., 1998). The relative undervaluation of “brown” firms (those with higher carbon emissions) in other developed countries, compared to the United States, may also contribute to this premium (Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz, 2020). 72  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Firms’ profitability and cash resources also do not appear to have acted as constraints. Subdued corporate investment in advanced economies since the GFC has coincided with the corporate sector shifting from being a net borrower to net lender on aggregate (Figure 2.7, Panel A). Gross corporate savings as a share of GDP have increased in more than half of the OECD countries with available data, driven by stronger profits, proportionally lower tax payments, and lower interest expenditures, although this has been partially offset by higher dividends in some countries including the United States, Canada and the Netherlands (Figure 2.7, Panel B). Overall, the ratio of net investment to net sales has also declined, implying that higher sales have not been proportionally matched with higher investment. Taken together, this suggests that capital costs, valuation signals and firms’ profitability cannot explain the weakness in business investment. Moreover, proxy measures of the UCC, Tobin’s Q and firms’ profitability are not statistically significant when added to the accelerator model (see Annex A), pointing instead to the growing importance of other determinants in explaining investment, particularly since 2012. These are likely to include heightened economic uncertainty and structural factors, such as changing investment patterns towards digital assets and evolving corporate behaviour. Figure 2.7. Strong corporate profitability has not translated into higher gross fixed capital investment Note: Panel A contains 33 OECD countries. It shows gross fixed capital formation and gross savings for the non-financial corporate sector as a per cent of nominal GDP, aggregated up to the OECD level. The difference between gross fixed capital investment and gross savings is approximately equal to net lending, but can vary depending on changes in inventories, other non-financial produced assets, and net capital transfers. In Panel B, the decomposition is based on the distribution of income account for the non-financial corporate sector within the System of National Accounts: Gross operating surplus = Gross saving + Net property income paid + Current taxes on income + Social transfers + Other transfers, where Net property income paid = Dividends - reinvested earnings on foreign direct investment + net interest paid + rents on land (for more information see (Chen, Loukas and Brent, 2017)). Source: OECD National Accounts database; and OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/e253dn Elevated uncertainty is likely to have held back investment Elevated uncertainty – both macroeconomic and policy related – is likely to have weighed on investment incentives and encouraged precautionary cash accumulation. Firms may hesitate to commit to long-term capital spending projects when the outlook for global demand, trade policy, or regulatory frameworks is unclear. Economic policy uncertainty indicators started to increase steadily around 2016, and trade policy uncertainty became elevated in the 2017-2020 period (Figure 2.8, Panel A). Empirical estimates (Box 2.1) suggest policy uncertainty may have accounted for approximately one-sixth of the overall investment shortfall relative to the pre-GFC trend (Figure 2.5, Panel A), and around one-quarter of the ‘gap’ across OECD countries (Figure 2.5, Panel B). Furthermore, recent survey evidence suggests that uncertainty is increasingly a major obstacle to investment for firms (Figure 2.8, Panel B).  73 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 More recently, measures of policy uncertainty have spiked due to heightened concerns about economic risks from tariffs on international trade. Estimates suggest that if these levels of high-uncertainty persist, the resulting decline in investment growth could lead to real investment being up to 1.4 percentage points lower by end-2026 (Box 2.1). In contrast, if policy uncertainty reverts to the average levels observed over the 2015-2019 period, investment could be 1.8 percentage points higher by end-2026 compared to a baseline where economic policy uncertainty remains at current levels. Figure 2.8. Uncertainty has increased, becoming a greater obstacle to investment Note: For Panel A, the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) is based on Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016) and the Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) index is from Caldara et al (2019). The EPU index is a nominal GDP-weighted average of national EPU for 21 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The TPU index is based on automated text searches of the electronic archives of seven newspapers.

Economic policy uncertainty and business investment in OECD countries Policy uncertainty has increased sharply in recent months across OECD countries. Elevated uncertainty can be a drag on business investment as firms often delay or scale back capital spending when future conditions are unclear. Earlier studies have found that the increase in US economic policy uncertainty in the 2005-2012 period was associated with a peak decline of 6% in US gross fixed investment (Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2016). Focusing on trade policy uncertainty, an increase equivalent to that observed during the 2018 period of higher tariffs has been found to be associated with a decline in private investment of 1-2% (Caldara et al., 2019). The impact of policy uncertainty on investment in OECD economies is quantified using a panel Vector Autoregression (VAR) model with quarterly data. The model includes real business investment, GDP, the GDP deflator, short-term interest rates and a measure of economic uncertainty, the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, developed by Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016), capturing both country-specific and global shocks. Results suggest that a one standard deviation increase in economic policy uncertainty reduces business investment growth by around 1 percentage point after one year, with the impact peaking after four quarters (Figure 2.9). This suggests that the increase in uncertainty during recent years may have reduced 74  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 annual investment growth by 0.4 percentage points on average across OECD countries, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the investment ‘gap’ shown in Figure 2.5. To illustrate the potential future implications, two scenarios are considered: • Lower economic policy uncertainty would lift investment growth. In a “confidence rebound scenario” where uncertainty declines from its value at the end of 2024 to the average levels over the 2015-2019 period by end-2025, the associated cumulative gain in business investment would be around 1.8 percentage points by end-2026 as compared to a baseline where economic policy uncertainty remains at current levels. • However, if current levels of high uncertainty persist and only decline towards their 2024 average, the resulting decline in investment growth could lead to real investment being 1.4 percentage points lower by end-2026. Figure 2.9. An uncertainty shock decreases business investment and GDP Note: Panels show the impact of a one standard deviation increase in economic policy uncertainty on business investment (Panel A) and GDP (Panel B). Grey shaded areas depict 90% confidence bands. The results are based on a panel VAR model for nine OECD countries with available data on business investment and economic policy uncertainty (Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States). The panel VAR specification features four lags of growth rates of GDP, GDP deflator, business investment, economic policy uncertainty (Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2016), the first difference of short-term interest rates and a linear trend. The model is estimated at quarterly frequency over 1997Q1 to 2024Q4. The identification of the structural shock to economic policy uncertainty rests on a Cholesky triangularisation of the variance-covariance matrix of the reduced-form residuals. The uncertainty shock is ordered first, implying that it affects all other variables at time t. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and OECD calculations.

The remaining weakness is likely to be related to broader structural changes within the economy. As economies transition toward more digital and knowledge-intensive production – accelerated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – investment has increasingly shifted toward intangibles, especially digital assets. At the same time, firms have channelled a lower share of their retained earnings and borrowed funds into productive investment, while maintaining persistently high required rates of return, or ‘hurdle rates’. Both these trends are likely to be associated with underlying factors that dampen investment, including declining competitive pressures and the rise of dominant firms, particularly in the digital sector, and difficulties in financing intangible investments. Investment in digital- and knowledge-based assets has increased The transition towards a more digital and knowledge-intensive economy in recent years has had a significant impact on the composition of business investment. Investment has been channelled into knowledge-based intangible assets, such as software, data, and research and development (R&D), and complementary tangible investments, such as ICT hardware, including servers, networking equipment, and cloud infrastructure (André and Gal, 2024). Together, these assets are an important driver of firm productivity and innovation (Corrado et al., 2021). Real investment in digital and knowledge assets has outpaced other asset classes across most advanced economies (Figure 2.10). Real investment in software has increased three-fold since 2008 on average in OECD economies, while investment in ICT hardware and R&D has grown by around 100% and 45%, respectively, over the same period, compared to aggregate growth of 12% for machinery and a 7% decline in investment in structures. Digital investment has expanded particularly rapidly in countries such as the United States and France, which have also seen strong growth in overall investment. In contrast, several countries, including Germany, have witnessed more modest increases. Investment has expanded particularly rapidly in tech-related firms (Figure 2.11). Firm-level data also show that AI-related companies invest in physical capital at nearly twice the rate of other firms, with their R&D investment rates more than three times higher (Figure 2.12). At the same time, firms appear to not be undertaking all the available profitable marginal investments that lower costs of finance should encourage. The average pre-tax rate of return on corporate capital assets has remained high in many economies in recent years, after dropping during the GFC and pandemic (Figure 2.15, Panel A). There is also evidence that required returns on investment have increased, since the gap between hurdle rates – the minimum expected return a firm requires to proceed with an investment – and capital costs has widened (Figure 2.16, Panels A and B) (OECD, 2015; Shah, Bunn and Melolinna, 2024). While rising policy uncertainty may have contributed to higher risk premia and thus higher hurdle rates, the scale of the increase points to additional underlying structural factors. 76  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.10.

The relatively stronger growth of digital and knowledge-based investment has not been sufficient to offset the impact of rising depreciation and weak tangible investment. Thus, net business investment as a share of GDP has declined across most OECD countries, despite a notable rise in digital and R&D investment (Figure 2.3). This decline reflects sluggish growth in traditional tangible investment categories — such as infrastructure and machinery — which still account for the largest share of business investment, alongside the higher depreciation rates for digital and knowledge-based capital (Figure 2.13, Panels A and B). On average, digital and knowledge-based assets now make up just over 35% of total capital formation, in current prices, up from around 28% at the turn of the century (Figure 2.13, Panel C).2 As investment has shifted toward these faster-depreciating assets, the overall depreciation or ‘scrapping’ rate has risen. 2 Despite ongoing enhancements to the National Accounts, some types of intangible assets are still not captured in business investment statistics, such as organisational and marketing capital. Some attempts have been made to measure these newer types of intangibles, suggesting that around half of intangible investments are not captured in official national accounts (Corrado et al., 2021). 78  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.13.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/k83o0q Corporate behaviour has shifted towards greater cash accumulation, higher shareholder payouts and rising required returns Instead of investing in fixed assets, firms have increasingly allocated savings toward accumulating financial assets or distributed earnings to investors through dividends and share buybacks. The increase in corporate net financial asset positions has been predominantly associated with the accumulation of financial assets rather than reductions in debt (Figure 2.14, Panel A). Firm-level data suggest that rising corporate gross operating surpluses have been associated with increased cash holdings and higher shareholder payouts, mainly through dividends (Figure 2.14, Panels C and D). In the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, share buybacks have also contributed significantly to this trend.3 Concurrently, the number and value of corporate mergers and acquisitions remained elevated during much of the post-GFC period, particularly in the United States and Europe, indicating that financial resources were utilised to acquire existing capital assets from other companies, rather than to expand the overall capital stock through internal investments (Figure 2.14, Panels E and F). Another possible use of corporate savings would be to invest in other countries, but there is little sign of this in outward foreign direct investment flows from the major economies, other than in Japan (Figure 2.14, Panel B). 3 The low cost of borrowing may also have incentivised firms to undertake non-investment financial activities such as leveraged buybacks and debt refinancing.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1jgaxn Shifts in the composition of investment and corporate behaviour have coincided with rising market concentration, higher markups and difficulties in accessing finance Market concentration has risen and business dynamism declined across advanced economies. These developments are increasingly linked to weak investment (Calligaris et al., 2024). Measures of industry concentration have risen in Europe and the United States, while product market concentration has also increased in European economies (Figure 2.17). At the same time, data from listed firms show a notable increase in markups – measured as the ratio of total revenue to the cost of goods sold – across most  81 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 advanced economies, with Italy being a notable exception (Figure 2.18). 4 Among emerging-market economies, markups have increased in India and South Africa but eased slightly in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia and Mexico. Net investment rates among listed firms have declined in all countries apart from Korea over the same period. In parallel with rising market concentration, business investment has also become increasingly concentrated among a small group of highly profitable “superstar” firms (Autor, 2020). This trend is closely linked to shifts in the composition of investment, as the greater scalability of intangible assets tends to boost returns for a limited number of firms, reinforcing “winner-takes-most” dynamics (Haksel and Westlake, 2018). The rise in overall market power appears particularly pronounced in the digital sector (Nicoletti, Vitale and Abate, 2023). These dynamics are further reinforced by growing concentration in institutional ownership. The widespread use of passive investment vehicles and consolidation in the asset management sector mean that many competing firms now share common large shareholders (Schmalz, 2017). Ownership concentration can weaken incentives for competition and has been associated with lower corporate investment (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2018; Azar, Schmalz and Tecu, 2018). Figure 2.17.

Increased market concentration can suppress investment through several channels. One is that dominant firms may restrict output and raise prices rather than invest in expanding capacity, particularly when competitive pressure is limited (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017). Another mechanism is that only large ‘superstar’ firms have the financial resources, managerial capability, and know-how to make large-scale investments with uncertain payback periods, effectively crowding out investment by smaller, less productive, or new firms (Crouzet and Eberly, 2019). Firm-level data suggests that large firms account for a higher share of investment relative to their output, although the gap has not increased over time (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). In reality, the relationship between market power and investment is likely to be nuanced, and firm specific. For example, firms may first achieve market power through innovation and efficiency, gaining scale through network effects and intangible synergies. Over time, however, some may shift their focus from innovation and fixed capital investment toward rent-seeking strategies, such as regulatory capture and lobbying, to preserve their dominant position (Akcigit and Ates, 2021). The availability of finance is a second key channel connecting the observed rise in intangible assets and precautionary corporate behaviour such as cash accumulation and high hurdle rates. Investment in software, data, and R&D as well as other intangibles, is harder to finance through bank loans, as these assets are more difficult to value and hence use as collateral. As a result, firms may need to self-finance these assets through retained earnings and higher cash holdings to reduce dependence on external financing (Demmou, Stefanescu, and Arquie, 2019), reducing available resources for investment. These constraints can be particularly binding for smaller firms and those operating in bank-based financial systems with less developed capital markets. Taken together, increased market concentration and financing challenges for intangibles provide additional plausible explanations for the persistent weakness in business investment. The relative importance of these factors likely varies across countries, sectors, and firms. Other factors may also have played a role. Rising investment costs – including limited land availability, planning delays, regulatory burdens, and implementation capacity constraints – can also deter firms from launching new projects. Moreover, the growing tendency of firms to prioritise shareholder payouts over reinvestment may reflect increasing financialisation (Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017) and incentives such as shareholder pressure to shift corporate strategy toward maximising short-term financial returns at the expense of long-term productive investment.  83 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Other structural trends – such as ageing populations and labour shortages - may also have restrained business investment, particularly in advanced economies. When firms anticipate slower growth in the working-age population, they may revise down expected demand for goods and services, reducing the need to expand productive capacity. This may more than offset any stimulative effects on investment from the downward pressure on real interest rates associated with higher savings in ageing populations — although this effect may also wane as retirees dissave (Eggertsson, Mehrotra and Robbins, 2019). Meanwhile, persistent skill shortages have emerged in some countries and sectors (OECD, 2024a), with over 50% of EU and US firms identifying the scarcity of skilled staff as a major obstacle to investment (Figure 2.21 Panel B). If firms are unable to find the necessary skills to implement, operate or maintain new capital – and fully reap their benefits -, they may postpone investment projects, particularly high-skill, high-tech investments that require complementary human capital, such as ICT and green technology.5 Housing investment has fallen short of demand, reducing affordability Residential housing investment accounts for around a fifth of total of total investment across OECD countries and has also slowed in recent decades (Figure 2.19, Panel A). Following a period of strong housing investment in some economies prior to the GFC, the subsequent tightening in credit conditions, household deleveraging, and the marked downturn in many housing markets contributed to a dramatic fall in residential investment during 2008-09.6 Although growth in housing investment eventually recovered, the past decade has seen a further steady decline. This was interrupted only briefly by a spike in activity following the pandemic in the context of low interest rates, increased demand for larger living spaces and government support measures. Real housing investment has contracted in recent years and continued to do so in most OECD countries over the year to the fourth quarter of 2024. A structural shortfall in housing investment relative to demand has contributed to rising house prices. Several factors have fuelled housing demand, including urbanisation, population growth, rising incomes, increased immigration, a shift toward smaller households, and greater access to mortgage credit (OECD, 2021). The supply-demand imbalance is a key reason why house prices and rents in many OECD countries have risen significantly faster than both inflation and household incomes over time, eroding affordability. These pressures are particularly acute in major cities and economically dynamic regions, where growth in demand for housing has far outpaced supply. Consequently, housing costs have absorbed an increasing share of household budgets, often at the expense of other essential spending categories such as food and transport (Figure 2.19, Panel B). Between 2000 and 2023, the share of consumption spent on housing rose by an average of close to three percentage points, reaching 17% in the median OECD country. The low responsiveness of housing supply to growing demand reflects a range of structural and regulatory constraints (OECD, 2021). The time required for planning and construction means supply adjustments are sticky, allowing price pressures to build up. In addition, rising construction and renovation costs (OECD, 2023), partly driven by stricter energy efficiency and environmental sustainability standards, have added to overall investment costs. Demand has been particularly concentrated in job-rich urban areas, where geographical limitations and regulatory restrictions, including land-use and zoning rules, are most restrictive (Cournède, De Pace and Ziemann, 2020). Other factors, such as rental market regulations, landlord-tenant laws, and labour shortages also affect the efficient functioning of housing markets and the construction sector, potentially discouraging investment in both the construction and maintenance 5 In other instances, companies in industries facing major shortages may choose to automate parts of their production instead, leading to increased investment in tangible capital (Dorville, Filippucci and Marcolin, forthcoming). 6 In some countries, housing investment growth prior to the GFC was excessive, with residential investment rising well above historical averages and exceeding 8% of GDP, including Spain and Ireland and reflected in surges in mortgage credit and household debt-to-GDP ratios. 84  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 of dwellings. In addition, persistently low productivity growth in the housing construction sector—often attributed to regulatory factors—may further undermine cost-efficiency and scalability (D’Amico et al., 2024).

StatLink 2https://stat.link/mzgpkh Public investment has picked up but remains below pre-GFC levels Public investment – accounting for around one sixth of total investment across OECD countries – declined significantly in many economies in the aftermath of the GFC. The decline was largely due to fiscal consolidation efforts, particularly in euro area countries that faced acute sovereign debt pressures (OECD, 2015). In contrast, the policy response to the pandemic was different, with many governments raising public investment to support the recovery (Figure 2.20, Panel A). This was especially evident in the European Union, where initiatives such as the NextGenerationEU funds have played a central role in boosting investment. A substantial share of these recovery packages was directed towards investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable transport infrastructure to support demand and progress toward long-term climate goals. Despite the recent upturn in some countries, critical public investment needs remain. Net public investment – after accounting for the depreciation of the existing capital stock – remains below pre-GFC levels (Figure 2.3, Panel C), raising concerns about deteriorating infrastructure in some countries and sectors. The stock of public capital relative to GDP has stagnated or declined over the past decade in many countries. Marked sectoral differences have emerged: while the share of public investment has increased in areas such as energy, defence, and healthcare, other sectors such as transport have declined (Figure 2.20, Panel B). Such declines can lead to quality shortfalls. The perceived quality of transport infrastructure declined in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, in the years prior to the pandemic (World Economic Forum, 2019), while declines in education performance were signalled by PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) scores declining across many OECD countries between 2018 and 2022. Moreover, insufficient public investment may also constrain private investment, as inadequate transportation, energy or digital infrastructure can limit firms’ growth and investment opportunities.  85 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Recent announcements of further increases in defence spending – particularly among European countries in response to heightened geopolitical tensions – are expected to result in some increase in public spending. However, the overall boost to public investment may be modest, as only around 20% of defence spending tends to be allocated to capital investment (see Chapter 1). Figure 2.20.

For the pandemic, the change is the difference between the ratio in 2023 and the average ratio over 2017–2019.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/4l2j5z Public policy reforms can help reinvigorate investment Public policies help shape the factors identified above as underpinning recent investment trends. Clear and predictable measures that incentivise business investment are particularly important, given business investment has been the main component behind the weakness in net aggregate investment across countries. Key messages from the analysis above are the importance of reducing policy uncertainty, promoting competition and business dynamism and alleviating financing constraints for intangible investment. These are consistent with many of the country-specific policy recommendations for boosting investment in Chapter 3 and summarised in Panel A of Figure 2.21, and would help overcome some of the key obstacles to investment commonly cited by businesses (Figure 2.21, Panel B). Outside of the business sector, there is scope to boost housing investment in some countries through regulatory reforms that include the easing of land-use restrictions and rental market regulations. In addition, high-quality public investment – particularly in green and digital infrastructure, research and development, health, and education – is needed in many economies and can boost potential output growth, especially if it crowds-in private investment spending. 86  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.21.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/vnz762 Reducing policy uncertainty would support stronger investment growth Clear and predictable public policy is needed to assuage economic policy uncertainty and help rejuvenate investment growth, as highlighted in Box 1. While the predominant factor behind the recent rise in economic policy uncertainty in advanced economies has been higher trade policy uncertainty, available measures also show increased uncertainty since early 2024 in categories related to fiscal, regulatory and climate policies. As such, improving the general clarity and predictability of economic policies in all areas of government could underpin stronger investment rates. This is a policy recommendation contained in many of the country notes in Chapter 3, including for the United States, Hungary, Korea and Türkiye. One potential channel is that reduced uncertainty could prompt businesses to reduce the risk-premia incorporated in the hurdle rates used for investment decisions (European Investment Bank, 2024). Specific approaches to reduce policy uncertainty may include:  87 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 • Conducting trade policy through a transparent and rules-based system with efforts made by governments to avoid introducing sudden policy changes that are unpredictable for businesses and consumers. Working together within the global trading system to find ways of addressing concerns with current trading arrangements could also help governments provide certainty about the future. • Reducing fiscal policy uncertainty by legislating and implementing credible medium-term strategies for achieving sustainable public finances amid rising fiscal pressures (e.g. from population ageing, climate change and defence spending). Strengthening fiscal frameworks by reinforcing transparent, rules-based approaches – while ensuring that fiscal rules are designed with well-defined, credible escape clauses – can help maintain policy credibility while preserving flexibility in the face of major shocks. Implementing stable and predictable tax rules, combined with clear dispute resolution mechanisms, can also help mitigate uncertainty (Box 2.3). • Reducing complexity and improving transparency around domestic structural policy changes in areas such as regulation of product and labour markets, migration policy and the financial system. Undertaking robust and transparent regulatory impact assessments would help give investors greater certainty. In addition, efforts to build a strong consensus around structural reforms by working with key stakeholders will support their longevity. • Affirming ongoing international commitments to mitigate climate change and outlining the policy approach to achieving climate commitments. At the same time, implementing well-designed adaptation measures that minimise the potential economic cost of future disruptions from climate change would provide greater certainty about the future operating environment. Various framework conditions shape the incentives to invest Policies and institutional arrangements shape the incentives of firms to invest, their ability to attract the required resources to do so and overall economic stability. Sound macroeconomic policies and a healthy financial system are the foundation of strong and resilient investment growth. Monetary policy should focus on achieving low and stable inflation and any additional statutory objectives. In some emerging market and developing economies, additional efforts to entrench credible monetary policy frameworks could provide greater monetary policy certainty and help anchor inflation expectations. In addition, macroprudential policy tools should be developed and deployed where necessary to guard against the build-up of systemic financial risks that might become the basis for future financial shocks and impede access to finance. Structural reforms can promote business dynamism and encourage firms to sharpen their focus on innovating and investing to stay ahead of competitors. Reducing the cost of regulations to businesses, both through reforming de jure regulations and implementing them in a way that does not unnecessarily raise costs, promotes firm entry and the ability of successful firms to expand. This can help mitigate trends towards rising market concentration, including in markets based around new intangible assets such as artificial intelligence technologies. Country-specific policy recommendations to promote investment by improving aspects of competition policy are made in the majority of country notes in Chapter 3 (Figure 2.21, Panel A). In emerging-market economies, clear and predictable regulatory frameworks can also reassure foreign investors about the operating environment. While, in theory, more restrictive domestic regulations could simply encourage firms to invest abroad, this is only an option for a subset of firms in certain sectors, with foreign investment more likely to be determined by a need to enter foreign markets, or acquire resources, or link to research or financial centres. Indeed, the available evidence does not support the notion that foreign investment is a substitute for domestic investment (Desai et al., 2005; Goldbach et al., 2019), with the importance of a wide variety of structural policies for domestic investment growth empirically well established (Égert, 2021). 88  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 New OECD estimates indicate that reducing product market regulation in network industries is associated with an increase in the capital stock in downstream business sectors. Policy experiments suggest that network sector deregulation between 1980 and 2023 could have raised the capital stock by around 4% in the average OECD economy, with gains reaching 10% in manufacturing and 5% in business services (Figure 2.22, Panel A). Looking ahead, bringing regulations in more highly-regulated economies towards the regulatory levels of their least-regulated peers could raise the economy-wide capital stock by up to 1.5%, with notably larger impacts for the manufacturing sector (Figure 2.22, Panel B). The effective design and implementation of product market regulations can also be hampered by the influence of lobbying activities. Reforms that improve the transparency and accountability of lobbying could address this and weaken the potential for regulations to be captured by incumbent firms and fuel rising market concentration (OECD, 2024b). Figure 2.22. Investment would benefit from further product market reforms Note: Panel A estimates are based on Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares regression results of how upstream regulation in network sectors, captured by the OECD’s REGIMPACT indicator, affects the capital stock (see Andrews et al. 2025 for further details). Panel B shows the potential capital stock gains from three reform scenarios that are based on measures of barriers to entry in network sectors in 2023: (1) convergence of the three most regulated OECD countries to the regulatory levels of the three least regulated (in orange); (2) convergence of the most regulated countries to the OECD average (in green); and (3) convergence of the OECD average to the benchmark set by the three least regulated countries (in blue). Source: Andrews et al. (2025). StatLink 2https://stat.link/9hswyg Well-functioning insolvency frameworks promote business dynamism by encouraging firms to invest and resources to be efficiently allocated from weaker exiting businesses to higher performing ones. At the same time, overly stringent bankruptcy regimes can deter risk-taking, weighing on innovation and bias firms’ choice of capital structure towards tangible investments at the expense of intangibles (Garcia-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2014). This is highlighted by OECD analysis showing that the economic gains from lowering barriers to efficient corporate restructuring increase with a sector’s intangible asset intensity (André and Demmou, 2022). Many countries have undertaken important reforms to insolvency frameworks over the past decade. Between 2016 and 2022, there was particularly notable progress in Europe and Canada (André and Demmou, 2022). Nonetheless, there remains scope for additional regulatory efforts in most countries to streamline insolvency processes, refine restructuring tools and improve the treatment of failed entrepreneurs.  89 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The stringency and complexity of land use regulations influence business dynamism and housing investment by determining the activities that can be undertaken in a certain location. More stringent and complex land use provisions can be a barrier to firm entry and moderate investment in physical assets in some sectors such as retail trade, as well as dwelling investment. Reducing complexity and introducing greater flexibility in zoning systems, including by being less prescriptive about the specific activities that can be undertaken on a parcel of land, can enable firm entry and growth, as well as the ability of the economy to adapt to ongoing structural change. Based on the country notes in Chapter 3, such recommendations appear to be particularly relevant in Australia, Austria, Croatia and Sweden. Sub\u0002national governments are often responsible for land use regulations and the implementation of planning approvals. Ensuring these administrations have sufficient fiscal incentives to reduce the complexity of regulations and streamline approvals can be important. An example is Switzerland, where local government finances are heavily reliant on property taxation and there is significant flexibility afforded to authorities to set the applicable tax rates. Efforts to harmonise regulations across sub-national jurisdictions and minimise responsibility overlaps could also reduce the cost of business investment, as well as promote spending on the housing stock. Indeed, a high degree of decentralisation of land-use decisions and responsibility overlaps are empirically associated with high rigidity of housing supply (Bétin and Ziemann, 2019). As discussed earlier, overly strict rental market regulations have inhibited housing investment in some countries. Regulations such as rent controls and landlord-tenant rules can provide protections for renters but may also reduce incentives to invest in rental housing due to lower rental revenues and the greater difficulty of selling properties (Kholodilin and Kohl, 2020). For instance, rent controls in San Francisco are estimated to have reduced housing supply by as much as 15% (Diamond, McQuade and Qian, 2019). OECD work has found that the house price elasticity of residential construction is considerably lower where there is stringent rental market regulation (Cavalleri, Cournède and Özsöğüt, 2019). Minimising regulatory barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) can help facilitate the best allocation of global investment and enhance competition. Capital spending may increase in both source and destination countries when vertical FDI is involved, leading to the buildup of global value chains. Nonetheless, as measured by the OECD FDI regulatory restrictiveness index, policy restrictions on inward FDI are high in some economies, especially in emerging-market economies (Figure 2.23). This may have contributed to the modest FDI inflows observed in recent years (Figure 2.14, Panel B). A renewed drive to ease or eliminate FDI policy barriers could support such inflows and capital spending in destination countries. According to the country-specific recommendations in Chapter 3, such a policy approach may be particularly relevant in Costa Rica, Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam, as well as in some advanced economies such as Korea, New Zealand and Switzerland. 90  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.23.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/qkigsw Policies that reduce financing frictions for intangible investment can alleviate the need for firms to retain cash resources to self-finance future intangible investment projects. It may also help enable young and small firms to undertake investment projects, promoting competitive pressures in more concentrated markets. Financial frictions can be especially acute in bank-based financial systems for firms without traditional forms of collateral. Such firms include those with a high proportion of knowledge-based assets and start-ups with limited credit history. Improving the depth of capital markets would support a more diverse range of funding options and promote competition between lenders, thus improving access to finance for new firm entrants and intangible investments. In Europe, making further progress on implementing the Savings and Investments Union will be important in this regard. Reforms that improve access to credit are also relevant in emerging-market economies including Brazil and India (Chapter 3). Developing certain segments of capital markets may require some public financial support and regulatory actions, provided they do not endanger financial stability. Possible examples include adjusting regulatory restrictions on the investment activities of pension providers, reducing administrative requirements on fintech lenders and equity crowdfunding platforms, reforms that enable “open finance”, and public investment in venture capital markets. The latter may be particularly well-suited to funding investments by innovative firms with non-standard risk profiles (Calvino, Criscuolo and Menon, 2015). Government involvement in venture capital deals has been particularly notable in Hungary but has also played a role in many other European economies (Figure 2.24). There can be synergies between promoting venture capital and efforts undertaken in some countries to develop specific public equity markets for smaller and innovative firms (for example, KOSDAQ in Korea, Mothers Exchange in Japan and SME growth markets in the European Union). These exchanges typically have simplified listing and disclosure requirements and can provide an appealing exit option for venture capital investors once successful firms expand (Carvajal and Dider, 2024). Further developing market-based finance could also ease access to finance in emerging\u0002market economies but would often benefit from complementary reforms that promote macro-financial stability and access to digital financial technologies (Banerjee, Mehrotra and Zampolli, 2024).  91 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Figure 2.24.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/y3opx8 The availability of workers with skills that match business needs can both encourage capital investment and maximise its productivity payoff. This can be aided by structural reforms that lower frictions in the labour market, such as reducing the prevalence of unnecessary non-compete clauses (Andrews and Garnero, 2025). Developing a workforce with skills that evolve with underlying structural changes in the economy can also be an important enabling factor for new capital investment, as skills demands are evolving rapidly with population ageing, the digital and green transitions (OECD, 2024a). More broadly, recent OECD estimates suggest that around one-sixth of the productivity slowdown in OECD countries since the mid-2000s can be accounted for by a weakening in human capital accumulation (Andrews et al., 2024). A key need is for effective government efforts to promote investment in lifelong learning. Policy reform priorities include ensuring strong foundational skills that form the basis for further learning, the availability of high-quality adult training programmes, and encouraging participation in education by adapting programs and qualification requirements, including for those currently in the workforce. High-quality public investment is needed in priority areas Public capital spending can play a key role in supporting aggregate investment, especially when economies are operating at less than full capacity. Where fiscal space allows, public investment can provide an immediate boost to economic activity by stimulating demand and employment, particularly in sectors with strong multiplier effects (Mourougane et al., 2016). In the longer term, high-quality public investment can crowd-in private investment, foster innovation, and raise human capital (Box 2.2), thereby boosting potential output growth. However, public investment can also crowd out private spending—especially in contexts where it increases borrowing costs for firms, either by heightening concerns over debt sustainability, or if it substitutes private investment rather than complements it. Anchoring public investment within a credible medium-term budgetary framework can enhance policy predictability, support prioritisation and sequencing, and strengthen fiscal sustainability (OECD, 2019). Robust public investment management frameworks are essential to ensure the efficiency of public capital spending and its complementarity with private investment. Close coordination with subnational governments is often required, particularly for infrastructure projects with regional development objectives. 92  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Box 2.2. Government investment and growth-enhancing structural outcomes What is the role of public investment in building human capital and fostering innovation? As governments aim to strengthen long-term growth and resilience – particularly in a context of constrained fiscal space – it is crucial that public spending is effectively targeted to areas that yield the greatest returns. This box examines the growth-enhancing effects of government investment in three key areas: research and development (R&D), education, and health. OECD work has long highlighted the importance of investment in these areas for raising potential output growth (Fournier and Johansson, 2016). Public R&D contributes to the economy’s knowledge base and can catalyse private sector innovation. Investment in education strengthens human capital by improving workforce skills, while spending on health supports a productive workforce.1 Figure 2.25. Government investment can have clear benefits for long-term growth Note: Cumulative impulse responses of a shock to government investment on a productivity channel. The dependent variable is in log differences, multiplied by 100, hence the impulse response functions can be interpreted as cumulative growth rates. The set of controls includes lags of the dependent variable, GDP per capita, GDP growth, the output gap and the fiscal balance (all lagged). Regressions include country and time fixed effects and are estimated with OLS. Confidence bands are shown at the 90% and 68% levels. Source: OECD calculations. StatLink 2https://stat.link/9snv6t To quantify the effects of government investment on key growth channels, a framework developed in recent literature on public debt is applied.2 Historical ‘spending surges’ – defined as increases of at least 10% and lasting three years or more – are identified in a panel of OECD countries from 1970 to 2019. This surge-based approach mitigates measurement challenges in fiscal data and improves identification by focusing on large, discrete shifts in spending more likely to be related to policy decisions. The dynamic effects of these surges on structural outcome variables closely linked to long-run growth are estimated using the local projection method (Jordà, 2005). The results suggest that spending surges are associated with meaningful improvements in growth-related outcomes. A sustained increase in government R&D spending increases private R&D expenditure by approximately 6% on average, 5 years after the shock (Figure 2.25). Surges in education spending are associated with a 2½ per cent rise in educational attainment, while increases in health spending reduce infant mortality by 2½ per cent. These effects tend to emerge gradually, underscoring the long-term nature of returns to public investment in these areas. ___________ 1. A broad definition of investment is used—covering physical capital and current spending—to reflect that operational expenditures (e.g. salaries of scientists, teachers, and doctors, as well as lab, classroom, and hospital resources) directly contribute to innovation and human capital formation. 2. Based on the forthcoming OECD Working Paper: ‘Government Spending and Growth Enhancing Structural Outcomes.’ 3. Infant mortality is used in the regressions since it is less subject to influence from confounding factors, but it is strongly correlated with other measures of mortality and life expectancy.  93 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Public investment can help enable the green and digital transitions, potentially crowding-in private investment. There remain significant investment needs in response to climate change. Global financing needs for climate mitigation are estimated at USD 5 trillion a year until 2030 (IMF, 2023). Investment needs for adaptation are also estimated to be large, though lower than for mitigation. Country-specific policy recommendations for increased climate-related public investment are highlighted in Chapter 3 for many advanced economies, as well as Malaysia and Mauritius. To complement public spending, other policy instruments – including pricing of climate-related externalities, information provision and regulations – can help more closely align private incentives with social benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation activities. Targeted public investment in basic research, through grants or publicly conducted R&D, can also catalyse private innovation in fields such as clean energy and climate technologies. Similarly, public investment can help support and encourage private investment in digital infrastructure. Efficient, reliable, and widely accessible digital infrastructure is essential to unlocking the full economic benefits of digitalisation, and public investment is often needed to extend coverage to rural areas or finance costly infrastructure projects with high positive externalities. Tax policy reforms can promote stronger private investment growth Tax policy settings also influence the conditions for private investment. While the recent decline in the user cost of capital has not been accompanied by strong aggregate investment growth in many economies, certain tax policy changes may be effective in incentivising investment spending. Low corporate tax rates on a broad corporate tax base can support investment by limiting the complexity of the tax system for businesses and distortions between different kinds of taxpayers. However, targeted measures such as relatively generous capital allowances or reduced non-profit taxes may be a more cost-effective way to support investment spending than general reductions in the statutory corporate tax rate (Box 2.3). Carefully designed tax incentives can also help address market failures in areas such as R&D spending and clean technology adoption (González Cabral et al., 2023; Dressler and Warwick, 2025). Temporary tax breaks, such as a short-lived acceleration in depreciation deductions, can also have powerful effects by advancing capital spending (Eichfelder and Scheider, 2014). However, such measures can be associated with deadweight costs and lower spending after the tax measure expires. In general, tax incentives may also be less effective in raising investment among firms with minimal profits (for example, small firms and start\u0002ups), where these incentives do not have provisions, such as allowing firms to carry-forward tax benefits, or tax credits to be refunded for firms without a tax liability. Tax measures that favour the accumulation of debt over equity can have negative consequences for financial stability by incentivising excessive debt accumulation and can have adverse implications for investment activity (Égert, 2021; Blundell-Wignall and Roulet, 2013). Incentives to favour debt financing may also inhibit the funding of intangible investments given that the underlying characteristics of these assets (uncertain returns, non-rivalry and low redeploy ability; Demmou and Franco, 2021) pose challenges in providing them as collateral against loans. However, this effect may be offset somewhat in tax systems that allow expensing of intangible investments. 94  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Box 2.3. Corporate income taxation and investment: impact and policy design considerations Corporate income taxation (CIT) is usually considered to be a key policy instrument for influencing business investment decisions. Since the seminal work of Hall and Jorgenson (1967), a large body of empirical research has found a negative relationship between CIT rates and investment (see e.g. Feld and Heckemeyer, 2011; Vartia, 2008; Schwellnus and Arnold 2008; Zwick and Mahon, 2017). Higher CIT rates reduce the after-tax returns on investment, thereby reducing the number of economically viable investment projects. Higher CIT rates also can negatively affect firms' cash flow, which reduces liquidity and can limit investment for firms facing financial constraints. The overall effect of CIT on investment also depends on the design of the CIT system beyond headline rates, including depreciation rules, tax allowances (such as accelerated depreciation), tax credits, CIT exemptions and reduced tax rates. Forward-looking effective tax rates, calculated based on hypothetical investment projects, can help gauge the impact of different design features of the tax system over the lifetime of an investment (Devereux and Griffith, 2003; Hanappi, 2018; González Cabral, Appelt and Hanappi, 2021; Celani, Dressler and Hanappi, 2022). The effective average tax rate (EATR) measures the average tax rate on investment projects earning positive profits or economic rents, while the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) reflects the tax burden on a marginal investment project that just breaks even. Figure 2.26 also shows that these rates vary across sources of finance (and they can also vary according to asset classes, project profitability and firm size), highlighting the distortions in many CIT systems. Figure 2.26. Effective corporate income tax rates vary strongly across assets and source of finance Distribution of statutory versus effective CIT rates across OECD countries, percentage of taxable income, 2023 Note: The distribution (minimum, maximum, median and interquartile range) of CIT rates across OECD countries. It compares statutory tax rates with synthetic tax policy indicators calculated on the basis of a prospective, hypothetical investment project. Unlike backward-looking effective tax rates, they do not incorporate any information about firms' actual tax payments. Further details of the model and assumptions are contained in OECD Corporate Tax Statistics and Hanappi (2018). Source: OECD Corporate Tax Statistics 2024 (OECD, 2024c). StatLink 2https://stat.link/75qr38 The impact of corporate taxation on investment: heterogeneity across firms and tax design Recent research suggests that the potential for corporate tax policy to support business investment varies across firms. Large, profitable multinationals — especially those with significant intangible assets, market power or profit-shifting opportunities — have become less sensitive to corporate tax changes in a single country over time, particularly since the global financial crisis (Hanappi and Whyman, 2023; Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023; Zwick and Mahon, 2017). Since a small number of large multinational firms account for a substantial share of total investment, this may reduce the aggregate investment response to tax policy changes.  95 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Moreover, evidence suggests that investment responses vary significantly depending on tax policy design. Increases in effective taxation through non-profit taxes (i.e. business taxes levied on bases other than corporate income, such as real estate or wealth) tend to have a stronger negative effect on investment than CIT. Reforms that affect the tax base, such as expanding capital allowances, can be more effective in supporting investment compared to statutory tax rate (STR) cuts (Hanappi, Millot and Turban, 2023). Studies indeed show increased investment in response to the provision of accelerated depreciation, immediate expensing, enhanced allowances and tax credits (Maffini, Xing and Devereux, 2019; Chodorow-Reich et al., 2024; Ohrn, 2019). However, care should be taken when using these allowances, as a CIT base that is too narrow can undermine revenue and introduce distortions. Reducing the debt bias in the CIT system can also reduce economic distortions and support financial stability (De Mooij and Hebous, 2018; Feld, Heckemeyer and Overesch, 2013). Alongside tax design, tax certainty is an essential condition for fostering business investment. Stable and predictable tax rules, combined with clear dispute resolution mechanisms, can reduce investment risk and support economic growth. In an increasingly globalised tax environment, both national policy choices and international cooperation can play a critical role in ensuring certainty. Enhancing the investment impact of CIT policy: potential options for reform Careful CIT design can enhance investment outcomes. Reforms could include: • Eliminating or reducing non-profit taxes, which tend to distort investment more than profit-based taxes. • Prioritise the use of more generous capital allowances and other tax-base measures, which often lead to stronger investment responses. • Limit tax incentives to areas with clear policy goals and strong governance arrangements, and where clear positive externalities warrant an incentive, such as for R&D or green investments. • Focus on expenditure-based tax incentives over income-based incentives. Support tax certainty through clear and predictable tax rules, clear eligibility criteria for tax incentives, and collaborative and consistent approach to tax administration, including internationally (OECD, 2024d).

An investment accelerator model To help assess the extent to which cyclical fluctuations have contributed to the observed dynamics in business investment since the global financial crisis (GFC) and the pandemic, a reduced-form investment model is estimated. This relates real business investment growth to its own lag as well as to current real output growth. The model is estimated for the 17 OECD countries for which data on real business investment are available. This empirical framework aims to capture the short-term response of investment to output fluctuations, shedding light on the role of demand-side factors in shaping investment patterns over recent cycles. The results are presented in Table 2.A.1. Annex Table 2.A.1.

An extended model is subsequently estimated that incorporates the standard determinants of investment implied by neo-classical frameworks, while also allowing for the role of time-varying capital depreciation rates, real equity prices (which may reflect corporate balance sheet conditions and elements of Tobin’s Q), and capacity utilisation, proxied by the output gap (with a prior that a more negative output gap reduces the need to undertake new investment). The model is estimated using an unbalanced panel comprising 13 OECD economies, with quarterly data from 1993Q1 to 2022Q3, subject to data availability. All variables enter the model in logarithmic form, except for the output gap. In line with Pelgrin et al. (2002), the user cost of capital is introduced as log(1+UCC). Country-specific effects are controlled for using a least squares dummy variable estimator.

Private consumption and investment will continue to recover, sustained by higher real disposable incomes, more favourable financing conditions and an improving business environment. The recent removal of capital restrictions will support further improvements in economic sentiment and investment. Inflation will continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace. Amid rising imports, the current account will deteriorate. Monetary policy will need to remain tight to maintain inflation on a firmly downward path. Fiscal policy should build on the recent successful adjustment with more sustainable consolidation measures, to maintain strong fiscal outcomes. This includes phasing out subsidies, and raising public-sector efficiency, while replacing distortionary taxes by broader income and consumption tax bases. Recent efforts to reduce the regulatory burden will boost productivity and should continue, complemented by stronger incentives for the formalisation of workers and firms. A strong economic recovery is underway After a strong contraction in the first half of 2024, activity bounced back to growth of more than 18% in annualised terms in the third quarter and over 5% in the last quarter of 2024. The recovery was driven by private investment, consumption, and exports. Short-term indicators point towards further improvement. Credit to the private sector is recovering. Consumer confidence and business sentiment have improved. Annual inflation has fallen from 211% at the end of 2023 to 47% in April 2025. Unemployment was 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, down from a peak of 7.7% in early 2024. Real wages have already surpassed their October 2023 level. Argentina 1.

New gas production is helping to reduce energy import dependence, and the sector now generates trade surpluses. Exports to the United States account for only about 9% of Argentina’s total exports, or around 1% of GDP, and have not been significantly affected by US tariff increases so far. Argentina’s own import tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers have been reduced in 2024 and further reductions are expected in 2025. Macroeconomic policies have become more restrictive An impressive fiscal adjustment has been achieved, resulting in a headline fiscal surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2024. The government remains committed to achieving a positive primary balance in 2025, consistent with a balanced headline budget. Monetary policy has also helped the ongoing stabilisation by putting an end to excess money creation. The real benchmark interest rate has become positive and is expected to remain so. A new exchange rate regime has been announced, with the exchange rate floating within bands that will widen by 1% per month. A recent agreement with the IMF will provide additional funding and help to rebuild currency reserves. The removal of currency restrictions has improved confidence and investment incentives. The economy is set for a robust recovery, but important challenges still lie ahead The economic recovery is expected to continue, with GDP growth of 5.2% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, driven by higher private consumption and investment. Private investment will gain further momentum as currency and capital controls have been lifted. Real wages will continue improving as inflation declines, supporting private consumption. Export growth will slow compared to 2024. Exports have been affected by the recent real appreciation of the currency. Imports will continue their strong recovery, sustained by higher purchasing power and lower import barriers. Headline inflation is projected to slowly continue its downward path, falling to 37% in 2025 and 15% in 2026, sustained by lower import costs, balanced public accounts and positive real interest rates. Higher international interest rates could make it more difficult to accumulate international reserves. Higher US tariffs could result in lower export growth, but export prospects in the agricultural and livestock sector could potentially benefit from changing trade patterns. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Argentina Current prices ARS billion GDP at market prices 46 219.1 5.3 -1.6 -1.7 5.2 4.3 Private consumption 29 096.4 9.4 1.0 -4.2 6.2 3.8 Government consumption 7 356.1 3.0 1.5 -3.2 1.6 0.6 Gross fixed capital formation 7 991.6 11.2 -2.0 -17.4 21.7 14.9 Final domestic demand 44 444.1 8.6 0.6 -6.6 7.9 5.2 Stockbuilding¹ 363.1 -0.4 -0.1 -1.9 -0.4 0.0 Total domestic demand 44 807.2 8.3 0.4 -8.5 8.4 6.7 Exports of goods and services 8 350.3 4.6 -7.5 23.2 11.2 6.4 Imports of goods and services 6 938.4 17.8 1.7 -10.6 23.9 14.5 Net exports¹ 1 411.9 -1.8 -1.5 4.4 -1.3 -1.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 69.9 135.4 207.9 51.7 32.7 Consumer price index² _ 72.4 133.5 219.9 36.6 14.9 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -0.5 -3.0 0.9 0.0 -0.8 Percentage changes, volume (2004 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Expanding the personal income tax base could raise revenues in a progressive way and would allow distortionary and inefficient taxes that hinder investment to be reduced. Eliminating VAT exemptions could generate additional revenues. Despite recent progress, trade barriers remain high and lower import barriers on intermediate and capital goods could boost investment and export competitiveness. Regulatory processes have been simplified, but entry barriers in services sectors could be reduced further.  107 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Australia After a period of weak activity, GDP growth will reach 1.8% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. The strong recent immigration-driven growth in employment and the labour force will subside, leaving unemployment little changed at low levels. Inflation will remain close to target, averaging 2.3% in both 2025 and 2026. Australia has limited direct exposure to US tariff changes but is at risk from any marked slowdown in China, especially via its effect on commodity prices. Monetary policy tightening in 2022-24 squeezed disposable incomes and restrained demand, facilitating a return of inflation to target. The easing that began recently should continue in the coming quarters as long as inflation remains subdued. The main fiscal priorities relate to the longer term, addressing demographic and climate challenges and improving the efficiency of the tax system. A range of policy actions, including easing zoning restrictions, is needed to strengthen competition and productivity, as well as to raise housing investment to reverse the long-standing decline in housing affordability. Public consumption has helped to avoid a hard landing but global trade tensions are hitting sentiment The growth of private domestic demand – especially consumption and housing investment – was weak in 2024, in part reflecting the cumulative effect of the rise in interest rates since 2022. This weakness was, however, largely offset by strong growth in government consumption. Activity indicators for early 2025, including household spending, suggest that the improved but still moderate private consumption growth seen in late 2024 has continued. Both business and consumer sentiment have worsened recently, however, likely reflecting the elevated uncertainty arising from global trade tensions. The disinflation that began in late 2022 has continued, with headline inflation at or below the mid-point of the target range since September 2024, although the central bank’s preferred measure of core inflation remains above target. Disinflation has been achieved with little deterioration in labour market conditions, with employment continuing to grow strongly – driven by high net immigration over the past three years – and unemployment remaining low. The strength of employment was facilitated by subdued wage growth, while vacancies have fallen back to their pre-pandemic trend path. Sluggish external demand for Australia’s main export commodities yielded lower export prices and near\u0002stagnant volumes over the past year. The resulting fall in export receipts contrasted with a 5% increase in imports, pushing the current account deficit up to 1.9% of GDP in 2024. Australia’s exposure to US tariff increases is limited given that exports to the United States represent only about 5% of total exports. The impact of global trade tensions on the Australian economy is more likely to come via the depressing effect of higher tariffs and policy uncertainty on investment worldwide, manifested in part by lower prices for iron ore, coal and natural gas. 108  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Australia 1.

Federal and state budgets for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 fiscal years imply a widening of the general government deficit by 1.3 percentage points of GDP in calendar year 2025, after an increase of 1.9 percentage points in 2024, before the deficit stabilises at just under 4% of GDP in 2026. This would mean an upward drift in the ratio of public debt to GDP, but net debt to GDP would remain modest, reaching only 6.6% in 2026. Growth should be close to potential in 2025-26 barring adverse external shocks Given renewed, if modest, real wage growth and a recovery in real disposable household income as interest rates decline, private consumption growth is expected to pick up this year and next, more than offsetting a slowdown in public consumption growth. Some interest-rate-sensitive investment, such as housing, is expected to rebound in 2025, but other investment will be hindered by elevated global policy uncertainty, leaving overall fixed investment growth little changed from 2024. Final domestic demand growth in 2025 is projected to be around 2%, as in 2024, but with export and import volume growth projected to be similar in 2025, the drag on GDP from net exports seen in 2024 eases, allowing GDP growth to pick up from 1.1% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025. A further improvement in private consumption and investment in 2026 is projected to push GDP growth up to 2.2% in 2026, roughly in line with potential. The main sources of risk to the projections are external, especially any negative developments relating to import demand in China, by far Australia’s largest export market and the largest consumer of the main Australian export commodities. Policies should be geared to maintaining macroeconomic balance while addressing structural weaknesses The expected continued easing of monetary policy is warranted barring shocks pushing inflation back up and/or causing expectations to become de-anchored, but the difficult external context may demand nimbleness on the central bank’s part. The widening of the fiscal deficit in 2024-25 and the further budgeted increase in 2025-26 are justifiable given the weakness of private demand, but governments should look to save any windfalls relative to current plans. Consolidation is needed over the medium term, given the fiscal pressures on the horizon, including population ageing and costs associated with the transition to net zero. Key structural policy priorities are to address the housing affordability crisis by boosting supply and to accelerate progress toward net zero carbon emissions, especially in transport and industry. The revitalisation of competition policy heralded by two agreements between federal and state governments signed in 2024 should also help to reverse the longstanding decline in trend productivity growth, including by boosting business investment via streamlined regulation at all levels of government. This should be complemented by other policies to strengthen investment, including improved incentives for housebuilding, especially for social housing, and public investment to improve electricity grid connections. 110  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Austria The economy is projected to begin recovering from a prolonged recession, with output declining by 0.3% in 2025, but growing modestly by 1% in 2026. A gradual pickup in household consumption and private investment, supported by lower interest rates and a resilient labour market, will help drive the recovery. Inflation is expected to decline towards 2% by end-2026. Progressive fiscal consolidation may constrain demand growth. A slowdown in activity in Europe or deepening of structural challenges may hold back the recovery, while more persistent wage increases could further impair competitiveness and sustain higher inflation. Fiscal plans should progressively reduce the budget deficit in the years ahead, bringing it below 3% of GDP. Leveraging EU funds would help cushion the impact of a restrictive fiscal policy stance while strengthening economic resilience through the structural adjustment of industries heavily affected by rising energy costs. Increasing labour force participation among women and older workers as planned, along with shifting taxation away from labour, would promote more inclusive growth and support the sustainability of the public finances. Plans to expand broadband should include easing regulations relating to infrastructure deployment alongside innovative policy instruments and incentives. The economy has continued to contract, albeit at a slower pace Economic activity rose by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, signalling a modest recovery after having declined for three consecutive quarters and, in particular, by 0.4% in 2024Q4. Output growth was primarily driven by industrial production (up 0.6%, q-o-q in real terms), services (up 0.8%) and exports (up 1.4%). Inflation rose to 3.3% in April from 3.1% in March.

Weak trade performance in recent years reflects sectoral challenges in key products, such as machinery and vehicles, processed goods, chemical products, and other manufactured goods. While direct exposure to increases in US tariffs on EU goods is modest, there are indirect effects through weaker demand in European markets as a whole, notably Germany. Gas and electricity connections to other European countries are being upgraded rapidly, which will improve energy security and may help to lower prices, including for energy-intensive sectors. Fiscal consolidation is planned In 2024, the budget deficit reached an unexpectedly high level of 4.7% of GDP, driven by higher-than\u0002expected wage increases and spending at sub-federal level, and breached the 3% of GDP threshold of the EU rules. The new government has introduced a seven-year budget consolidation plan. In the short run, spending cuts are scheduled to amount to approximately EUR 6.3 billion in 2025 (1.3% of GDP) and EUR 8.7 billion in 2026 (1.9% of GDP). The spending reductions are primarily targeted at reducing pensions, family support and environmental subsidies and implementing across-the-board cuts in all ministerial departments. The plans also incorporate targeted tax increases on banks, tobacco products, gambling, real estate transactions and foundations, but tax relief for SMEs, as well as incentives for additional performance and investments in social welfare and economic growth. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Austria Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices* 406.1 5.4 -0.9 -1.3 -0.3 1.0 Private consumption 201.3 5.2 -0.3 0.1 0.6 1.4 Government consumption 88.6 -0.5 1.2 1.6 1.4 1.0 Gross fixed capital formation 105.5 0.3 -3.1 -3.6 0.0 1.5 Final domestic demand 395.4 2.6 -0.7 -0.5 0.6 1.3 Stockbuilding¹ 6.6 1.3 -3.0 -1.0 0.3 0.0 Total domestic demand 402.0 3.9 -3.7 -1.5 1.0 1.4 Exports of goods and services 227.7 10.1 -0.5 -4.3 -0.9 2.0 Imports of goods and services 223.7 7.1 -4.5 -5.0 0.7 1.6 Net exports¹ 4.0 1.7 2.5 0.3 -0.9 0.3 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 4.8 6.6 3.0 2.5 2.2 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 8.6 7.7 2.9 3.0 1.9 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 5.1 7.3 3.9 2.9 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 4.7 5.1 5.2 5.2 5.2 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 8.8 8.7 11.7 12.3 12.9 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -3.4 -2.6 -4.7 -4.4 -4.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 85.1 87.0 90.1 93.0 94.9 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 78.3 78.4 81.8 84.7 86.6 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -0.9 1.3 2.4 1.8 1.5 Percentage changes, volume (2015 prices) * Based on seasonal and working-day adjusted quarterly data; may differ from official non-working-day adjusted annual data.

Household consumption is expected to rebound gradually as real wages continue rising following previous inflation adjustments. With falling interest rates, private investment should begin to recover in the second half of 2025, although at a subdued pace given uncertainty and structural challenges. Trade growth will be relatively modest given wider regional developments, but will be supported in 2026 by higher government spending in Germany. Inflation is expected to decline steadily over the remainder of 2025 and 2026. Risks to these projections are skewed to the downside. Heightened trade tensions affecting Germany and an extended crisis in the automotive and other industrial sectors could further undermine economic prospects. More persistent wage increases could further hamper competitiveness. The fiscal consolidation plan may exert a stronger-than-expected dampening effect on economic activity, potentially resulting in a prolonged period of sluggish growth. Fiscal consolidation is needed and structural reforms would help sustain the recovery The medium-term consolidation strategy aims to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually until 2031 but phasing it in more progressively in the initial two years would limit the near-term impact on economic growth. Sustaining the consolidation path will be challenging given that population aging is projected to add fiscal pressure of around 2% of GDP by 2030, on top of rising interest payments and climate and defence spending. Reforms aimed at reducing regulatory barriers such as cutting red tape and lowering entry barriers in targeted sectors, in particular, professional services, would boost competitiveness and business investment. Similarly, addressing regulatory bottlenecks in housing, by easing land-use regulations, could improve housing supply and stimulate construction investment. Accelerating public investment plans to expand communications networks and high-speed connectivity, and easing related regulatory constraints, would foster digitalization and support long-term economic growth. Policies to increase female labour market participation – such as the planned expansion in child and long-term care facilities – and measures to raise the effective retirement age would help mitigate the impact of a declining working-age population.  113 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Belgium Economic activity is projected to continue to expand at a modest pace, with GDP growth stable at 1.0% in 2025 and 2026. Household consumption remains the primary driver of economic activity but is expected to slow as real income growth moderates. Investment is set to decelerate following robust growth in 2023 and 2024, primarily due to heightened uncertainty surrounding international trade developments. Export growth continues to be subdued, reflecting weakening competitiveness and sluggish external demand. Disinflation is expected to continue, pushing inflation below 2% in 2026. The fiscal deficit remains substantial, and meaningful fiscal consolidation efforts will only resume in 2026, leaving Belgium unlikely to meet European Union fiscal targets for both 2025 and 2026. The existing tax structure disproportionately relies on labour taxes, negatively affecting employment. Implementing comprehensive tax reforms to broaden the tax base, reduce distortions, and address disincentives to work could significantly enhance potential economic growth. Additionally, reducing administrative burdens, particularly for small businesses, could further stimulate investment. Growth has moderated Private consumption strengthened during the second half of 2024, buoyed by robust real disposable income growth in preceding years, but slowed markedly at the beginning of 2025. Public consumption followed a similar pattern. Other growth drivers have been less dynamic. Private investment has been weak, constrained by sluggish exports and subdued residential construction, although both rebounded in early 2025, pushing quarterly GDP growth to 0.4% (non-annualised) in the first quarter of 2025. Export performance has been consistently poor, resulting in the current account returning to a deficit. Changes in US tariff policies and the uncertain international environment have led to sharp falls in business and investor confidence since the end of 2024. Although the labour market remained resilient into early 2025, employment growth slowed significantly compared to previous years. Disinflation trends have persisted, with core inflation easing to 2.3% in April 2025. Headline inflation also declined to just above 3%, down from over 5% in the summer of 2024, driven in part by base effects from earlier increases in tobacco and energy prices. 114  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Belgium 1.

While its direct bilateral trade exposure to the new US tariffs on EU goods is limited – with exports to the United States primarily exempt goods like pharmaceuticals and chemicals – its exports would suffer from an ensuing slowdown of its main European partners. Fiscal consolidation is slow Automatic indexation bolstered household purchasing power during the post-pandemic inflation surge but also exacerbated fiscal deficits and weakened competitiveness. The transition to a new government has contributed to further delays in advancing fiscal consolidation efforts. Despite an anticipated reduction in the structural primary deficit to 2.4% of potential GDP by 2026 (down from 3.2% in 2024), achieving the EU fiscal targets will likely remain unattainable. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate further in 2025 before slightly decreasing to 4.5% in 2026, the same level as in 2024. Rising uncertainty will weigh on growth prospects Economic growth is expected to remain below potential. The investment recovery will continue to face headwinds from elevated global trade uncertainty, although residential investment is expected to improve gradually from low levels. Wage growth moderation aimed at restoring competitiveness will result in slower private consumption growth. Export activity will remain weak due to softer external demand, keeping the current account broadly balanced. Consumer prices are expected to decelerate, with core inflation falling below 2% in both 2025 and 2026. Increased European defence expenditures, notably from Germany, may provide a modest boost to exports. Conversely, Belgium might face increased import penetration from China, a risk further aggravated by recent losses in competitiveness. Bold reforms are needed to address domestic challenges Effective fiscal consolidation should prioritise enhancing spending efficiency in healthcare and pension systems alongside comprehensive tax reform to shift taxation away from labour towards broader, less distortionary bases. A credible medium-term fiscal strategy featuring multiannual budgeting frameworks and binding expenditure rules at federal and regional levels is essential. Labour market policies should progressively phase out work disincentives and incentivise prolonged employment. Long-term economic growth would benefit significantly from regulatory simplification and expanded access to lifelong learning. Achieving climate objectives will require stronger incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments. Reducing administrative burdens on small and innovative businesses would further support investment and economic dynamism. 116  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Brazil Real GDP is projected to expand by 2.1% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. Household consumption will continue to be the principal driver of growth, even if slowing, bolstered by robust wage increases. Private investment experienced a marked pickup in 2024 and is expected to remain buoyant despite easing gradually. Export momentum is projected to improve modestly, albeit against a backdrop of significant exposure to demand from China. Inflation is projected to remain above the 3% target throughout both 2025 and 2026, driven predominantly by the services sector. Fiscal policy is expected to remain slightly expansionary in 2025. A proposed income tax reform, designed to be tax-neutral, is unlikely to generate additional fiscal space to accommodate rising spending pressures. Social expenditures are set to continue to rise, putting further pressure on the public finances. A tight monetary policy stance is projected to continue for some time. Lowering market entry and exit barriers, easing regulations, boosting infrastructure investments and fostering competition have significant potential to boost productivity and growth. Economic activity is slowing down Despite robust GDP growth of 3.4% in 2024, early signs of an economic slowdown emerged toward the end of the year. Domestic demand weakened, driven by a decline in household consumption coupled with lower investment, as heightened uncertainty, rising policy rates, and persistent inflation undermined both business and consumer confidence. Industrial production remains subdued, but after five consecutive months of stagnation, it grew by 1.2% in March. Retail sales have moderated after a 4.7% annual increase in 2024. Conversely, the services sector maintained its strong momentum in early 2025, propelled by the information and communications sector. In agriculture, the 2025 harvest is projected to be much stronger than in 2024, which was affected by a drought. Although unemployment edged up slightly to 6.8% in February from its historic low in November, the labour market remains resilient, as evidenced by record\u0002high formal-sector employment and earnings.

This tightening is intended to address price pressures from a positive output gap, a tight labour market with robust wage growth, an ongoing fiscal expansion, and a depreciating currency, all of which are driving inflation expectations higher. Despite heightened policy uncertainty, the projections include further rate increases, bringing the policy rate to 15% towards the end of 2025, before a gradual reduction to 12% by the end of 2026 as inflationary pressures ease. Fiscal policy is expected to remain modestly expansionary, posing challenges for meeting the primary balance target. Under the current fiscal rule, the government is required to achieve a balanced primary budget in 2025 and a primary surplus of 0.25% of GDP in 2026. However, persistent spending pressures from social benefits and strict minimum spending requirements for healthcare and education, pose significant challenges for meeting these targets. Moreover, slower economic activity is likely to constrain government revenue growth. This financing gap may end up being bridged by one-off measures, such as increased dividend and royalty receipts, or by broad-based expenditure freezes. Additionally, interest payments, currently estimated at around 8% of GDP, will continue to follow rising interest rates, increasing the growth of gross public debt. Growth is set to ease Economic growth is projected to ease from 3.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025, and 1.6% in 2026. The moderation is largely driven by a slowdown in domestic demand. Household consumption is expected to soften as higher inflation and weaker consumer confidence take their toll. After a strong rebound in 2024, private investment will likely become weaker over 2025 and 2026 due to softening external demand and the impact of higher interest rates. On the supply side, the manufacturing sector faces challenges from rising tariffs in the United States, which remains the primary destination for Brazilian manufacturing exports. Annual inflation is forecast at 5.7% in 2025 before easing slightly to 5.0% in 2026. This reflects quarterly inflation gradually converging toward the target, reaching around 4% in the final quarter of 2026, although intermittent upticks from trade and tariff shocks remain possible. The projections are subject to several risks. Fiscal slippage could dampen investment and erode confidence. Inflation risks are slightly tilted to the upside as persistent financial market tensions and further currency depreciation could intensify price pressures. Moreover, any additional deterioration of confidence in the fiscal outlook would likely extend the current episode of unanchored inflation expectations and require higher interest rates for longer, further undermining the economic outlook. Consolidating public spending while expanding infrastructure investment Fiscal consolidation is essential to put public debt on a declining trajectory. Reforming automatic spending rules, particularly those concerning education and healthcare, would allow greater flexibility to address priority challenges, and adjusting the indexation formula for public pensions and social benefits would reduce the burden of these benefits on the public finances. Stringent regulations and high administrative burdens on goods and services markets hinder competition and hamper the entry of new firms, thus dampening productivity growth and investment. Although recent measures have trimmed unnecessary bureaucracy, further reductions in regulatory burdens and licensing requirements remain critical. Easing entry restrictions in professional services, including abolishing exclusive rights for certain ancillary tasks, could reduce the cost of doing business, thereby boosting competition and enhancing productivity. Moreover, enhanced access to foreign markets and deeper integration into global value chains can be achieved by lowering existing trade barriers. Public spending on infrastructure could become more effective by addressing shortcomings in planning and project execution, as more than 30% of public  119 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 infrastructure projects are interrupted either temporarily or permanently. Expanding technical assistance to subnational governments, which frequently face capacity constraints for infrastructure project preparation and procurement, would significantly enhance the planning and delivery of such investments. Finally, unlocking additional private financing sources is crucial for bridging infrastructure gaps in the medium term. A comprehensive reassessment of current risk-sharing mechanisms and a concerted effort to minimise policy risks and judicial uncertainty could improve the framework conditions for private infrastructure investments. 120  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Bulgaria GDP is expected to increase by 2.6% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026 driven by household consumption growth, supported by ongoing high income and credit growth, and higher government investment with the rollout of EU funds. Exports will grow slowly reflecting weaker growth in other EU economies. Headline inflation has been rising and wage pressures remain elevated. Sustained wage growth risks hindering the moderation of inflation. Interest rates have followed those in the euro area, under the currency board, but transmission to the Bulgarian economy is slow and incomplete, contributing to a household credit boom. Further macroprudential measures should be deployed. Bulgaria has requested an assessment of its readiness to join the euro area, which is assumed to occur in January 2026. The fiscal deficit is set to remain consistent with the 3% of GDP threshold. A more business-friendly administrative environment would help to boost investment, while more effective activation policies and measures to tackle informality would help to make better use of Bulgaria’s labour force. Growth has been driven by consumption GDP increased by 2.8% in 2024 with strong household consumption driven by wage increases, credit growth and higher government transfers. Both public and private investment have been weak due to political uncertainty and low absorption and delay of EU funds. Industrial activity fell below its pre-pandemic levels in the first three months of 2025 reflecting continued declines in mining and energy production. Manufacturing output continued its downward trend, though it remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Services and construction activity also remained above pre-pandemic levels. Overall, in the first quarter of 2025, GDP increased by 0.6% (non-annualised). Annual headline inflation increased to 3.5% in April 2025 from 2.4% in April 2024. Unemployment has been declining in tandem with the pick-up in economic activity. Bulgaria Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database.

Imports recovered more than expected in 2024, supported by domestic consumption, and outpaced exports, weighing on the current account balance. Recent changes in global trade policies and higher US tariffs on imports of goods from the EU will have a modest impact on trade, GDP growth and inflation, largely through spillover effects from weaker EU demand as direct trade linkages with the United States are weak. Interest rates will stay low, while the budget deficit will remain at 3% of GDP Interest rate developments will continue to broadly follow euro area monetary policy given the currency board regime. However, transmission of monetary policy to domestic deposit and lending rates has been slow and incomplete due to high liquidity and stiff competition in the banking sector, leading to lending rates that are below euro area norms and strong domestic credit growth. Bulgaria requested a convergence report assessing its readiness for euro adoption in January 2026. Fiscal policy is set to meet the 3% of GDP EU ceiling for the budget deficit. The government may need to make spending adjustments relative to the budget if efforts to boost VAT revenue collection fall short, given planned strong spending in public sector salaries, minimum wages, pensions and social benefits. GDP growth will remain relatively strong Growth is projected to remain strong at 2.6% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026. Private consumption will continue to be boosted by low unemployment, ongoing positive gains in real incomes and domestic credit growth.

Export growth will be more subdued due to challenges in key export markets, while imports will be strong, driven by consumption and investment growth, increasing the current account deficit. Inflation is set to increase to 3.8% in 2025, following strong readings at the beginning of 2025 due to higher food prices, excise and VAT rates as well as household utility prices. Higher minimum wages coupled with persistent labour shortages will keep wage pressures elevated. Strong wage growth due to minimum wage and pensions indexation mechanisms risks high and persistent inflation while lower revenue collection relative to budget expectations risks widening the budget deficit. More prudent fiscal policy and a business-friendly investment climate are needed A modest fiscal consolidation is warranted to help moderate domestic demand and price pressures, and manage long-term spending pressures from ageing, climate and security needs. Reforming the current minimum wage and pension indexation mechanisms to slow the pace of growth in labour costs and government spending would support price stability. A more business-friendly investment climate with lower cost of doing business and reducing perceptions of corruption would attract more capital, domestic and foreign. Bringing more people into the workforce, alongside improvements in labour quality, would strengthen investor confidence in the availability of skilled workers and the effective utilisation of their investment. Improving digital and road infrastructure would enhance the prospective return on investment.  123 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Canada GDP growth is projected to weaken from 1.5% in 2024 to 1.0% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026 due to trade tensions with the United States. Exports and business investment are expected to decline in 2025, while deteriorating employment prospects are expected to weigh on household consumption. Headline inflation will rise slightly, as the impact of higher tariffs on consumer prices is partially offset by lower energy prices due to the removal of the fuel charge. Core inflation will increase for a period before falling back towards 2% next year. Uncertainty about tariff levels and the impact on the Canadian economy remains high. The Bank of Canada has reduced interest rates to 2.75%, with further modest cuts expected this year. However, inflationary pressures from higher tariffs will require a more cautious approach to lowering interest rates. Increased government spending, particularly on housing affordability and new social programmes, has recently worsened the general government balance, although it had previously been in surplus. A key policy priority remains the need to enhance Canada’s weak productivity performance by removing internal barriers to trade and labour mobility, and by strengthening investment and innovation. GDP growth was robust in early 2025, but the outlook has deteriorated Real GDP grew robustly by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2024. Private consumption benefited from the temporary reductions in the goods and services tax (GST) and harmonised sales tax (HST) on qualifying goods. Housing investment continued to recover, and business investment rebounded after a previous quarterly decline. Leading indicators show that economic momentum continued into early 2025, with GDP growing by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2025 according to the flash estimate. However, the outlook has worsened since then due to rising trade tensions with the United States. Business and consumer sentiment have deteriorated, and policy uncertainty has increased. The labour market showed renewed signs of weakening in April, with the unemployment rate rising to 6.9%. Consumer price inflation eased to 1.7% in April, down from 2.3% in March, driven by lower energy prices following the removal of the federal fuel charge and the decline in oil prices. Core inflation increased to 2.6% in April, after 2.4% in March. Since February 2025, trade tensions and increased tariffs on imports to the United States heavily weigh on Canada’s external perspectives, given the interlinkages of the two economies. The heightened uncertainty about tariff levels also burdens long-term spending and investment decisions. For Canada, the tariffs include a 25% tariff on goods and a 10% tariff on energy and potash for imports into the United States that do not fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The projections assume that about 50% of imports do not fall under the agreement. Additionally, they incorporate the 25% tariff rate on steel and aluminium products and the 25% tariff rate on non-US content in USMCA-compliant automobiles. They also account for the counter measures announced by the Canadian government. The broader rise in US tariffs will also dampen external demand. The increased volatility of financial conditions will also adversely impact the near-term outlook. 124  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Canada 1 Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and S&P Global.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/5obnjx Monetary policy has eased, and fiscal policy will be supportive in 2025 The Bank of Canada began to lower interest rates in June 2024, with a total decline of 225 basis points as of mid-April 2025, bringing the policy rate to 2.75%. The projection includes a further 50 basis point reduction in the rate during 2025. The central bank will need to carefully balance the opposing impacts on inflation from tariffs: upward pressure from higher import prices and downward pressure from lower demand. Quantitative tightening, i.e. net asset sales, ended in March. The transmission of lower policy rates to lending rates has progressed, and its impact on the real economy is expected to become more apparent in 2026, as other uncertainty factors wane. The general government budget balance has shifted from a small surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2023 to a deficit of 2.1% of GDP in 2024, driven by a one-off compensation payment of about 0.7% of GDP, higher interest payments and increased discretionary spending, particularly on new social programmes and affordable housing. The headline deficit is set to improve in 2025, while the underlying primary balance will slightly weaken. The removal of the federal fuel charge on April 1 will have a broadly neutral budgetary impact, as its revenues were principally recycled back to households and businesses through the \"Canada Carbon Rebate”. For 2026, a further improvement in the headline balance is assumed, helped by mild fiscal tightening. GDP growth is expected to slow due to trade tensions After still robust GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025, GDP growth is expected to drop in the second quarter due to sharply falling exports to the United States due to higher tariffs. Household consumption and business investment will also be affected negatively by trade disruptions and high uncertainty. Housing investment is anticipated to remain broadly flat in the first half of 2025, weighed down by elevated uncertainty. Imports are expected to decline less than exports, resulting in a negative net export contribution to GDP growth in 2025. Labour market conditions will further deteriorate in 2025. In 2026, GDP is projected to slowly recover as the economy adjusts to the new tariff environment. Lower interest rates will support business investment and household consumption as uncertainty declines. However, 126  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 slower population growth will moderate aggregate consumption growth. Consumer price inflation is expected to be pushed upwards by higher tariffs, which will increase import prices. However, starting April 1, this will be partly counterbalanced by lower energy prices resulting from the removal of the federal fuel charge. Core inflation is anticipated to increase more sharply in 2025 before gradually declining in the course of 2026. Substantial risks remain, reflecting the highly uncertain situation. Externally, there are risks regarding additional tariffs on Canadian imports to the United States and the potential lifting of the USMCA exemption. Conversely, tariff reductions for Canada could improve economic prospects. US tariffs on other countries could rise or remain at their current levels after the current 90-day suspension period, affecting external demand. There is also significant uncertainty regarding how tariffs will pass through to the Canadian economy, given the magnitude of the tariffs and the strong interconnectedness of North American supply chains. Domestically, new reform measures by the incoming government present upside risks to GDP, while stronger-than-anticipated spillover effects from trade tensions to domestic financial conditions could pose downside risks. Reforms could strengthen productivity and internal markets Trade tensions have highlighted Canada's dependence on the US economy. While the United States remains an important trading partner, Canada should continue to diversify its export markets. Furthermore, Canada can enhance its productivity performance and strengthen internal markets. High regulatory barriers on interprovincial trade should be reduced by expanding the scope of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. A Canada-wide recognition of foreign credentials could improve labour mobility for immigrants. There is also room to strengthen innovation and competition. Existing R&D tax incentives should be streamlined for both smaller and larger companies and include more direct support. The competitive environment for digital and telecommunication businesses could be further strengthened. The government could also increase investment in infrastructure. Finally, the removal of the federal fuel charge will necessitate a reassessment of Canada’s carbon emissions reduction strategy.  127 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Chile Output is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025 and in 2026. Household consumption will benefit from rising real wages and job creation, while investment will be supported by reduced credit costs and improved business confidence. Export growth is projected to remain solid, despite ongoing global trade uncertainties. A broader expansion of global tariffs could affect Chile’s exports. Inflation is projected to gradually fall to 3.3% in 2026. Monetary policy is expected to gradually converge to a neutral stance as inflation stays on a declining path. Fiscal policy will remain prudent, guided by the fiscal rule, and focused on keeping debt sustainable while supporting targeted investment and social spending. Advancing structural reforms to simplify regulations, improve permit procedures, and boost skills and innovation will be essential to lift investment and productivity growth. Growth remains resilient despite global risks Activity has strengthened since mid-2024, with annual seasonally adjusted GDP growth reaching 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The March monthly economic indicator points to continued expansion and an upward revision in growth in early 2025, driven mainly by non-mining components. Industrial output is recovering, helped by solid external demand and recovering business sentiment. Headline inflation has edged up recently, to 4.5% in April, reflecting the adjustment of electricity tariffs after a multi-year freeze, to align prices more closely with actual generation and distribution costs, and higher energy costs. Core inflation, however, has continued its downward trend, falling steadily to 3.7% in April 2025. The impact of the rise in energy prices on inflation is expected to be temporary. Two-year ahead inflation expectations remain firmly anchored around the central bank’s 3% target. Real wages are rising again and employment is growing, although the pace of job creation remains uneven across sectors. Chile 1. Consumer price index excluding energy and food.

China’s improved outlook has sustained demand for Chilean commodities, reinforcing export revenues. Tourism inflows have recovered, benefiting retail and services. However, global uncertainty has intensified due to new tariff increases in the United States, Chile’s second-largest trading partner. The United States accounts for just 16% of Chilean exports of goods, with 45% of those shipments – including copper, other minerals, and wood products – currently exempt from US tariffs. Monetary policy will be broadly neutral alongside fiscal consolidation The monetary policy stance is expected to converge towards the estimated neutral rate of 4%, following a pause in the easing cycle, and the output gap is narrow. Gradual rate cuts are expected in 2025 by the central bank, with policy rates falling to 4¼ per cent in the latter half of 2026. On the fiscal side, policy is assumed to remain prudent in 2025 and 2026, in line with the government’s commitment to the fiscal rule. The government announced additional fiscal consolidation measures in the first quarter of 2025, totalling about 0.6% of GDP, mainly through administrative spending cuts. The primary balance is projected to improve gradually, with debt stabilising over the projection period. Revenue raising measures including a new mining royalty are set to support revenues and help finance key programmes over the projection period.

Rising trade tensions, particularly involving the US and China, are expected to weaken growth in key export markets. Headline inflation is set to converge to 3% by the end of 2026, reflecting waning supply shocks, anchored expectations and contained wage pressures. Core inflation will continue declining, helped by prudent monetary policy and a stable exchange rate. Volatile energy and commodity prices and weather-related disruptions may cause temporary inflation fluctuations. Risks to the outlook include a sharper slowdown in global demand for copper, potentially triggered by weaker activity in China. Global uncertainty, if prolonged, could weigh on sentiment and investment. On the upside, faster progress in large mining projects and stronger household real wage growth may boost domestic demand more than expected. While financial spillovers remain contained for now, increased global market volatility could tighten financing conditions. Streamlined regulation would improve the investment climate Ensuring macroeconomic stability and public debt sustainability requires balancing fiscal consolidation with efforts to boost long-term growth. In addition to prudent budget management, continued progress in reducing regulatory barriers and fostering competition is essential, including through simplified procedures that lower entry barriers for new firms across sectors. Advancing the permit reform, currently underway, will simplify, standardise and speed up the issuance of multiple sectoral permits to boost investment while maintaining environmental safeguards. Promoting green and resilient infrastructure requires significant investment while fostering innovation, particularly in clean technologies. 130  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 China Economic growth will slow to 4.7% in 2025 and weaken further in 2026 to 4.3%. Consumption is being dampened by still high precautionary savings as a scarring effect of the pandemic, and the real estate correction but will be supported by the continuing trade-in programme in 2025. Investment in the real estate sector will continue to contract, but business investment will be buttressed in 2025 by the trade-in programme for enterprises. Infrastructure investment will be stable. Exports will be curbed by the newly imposed tariffs on trade with the United States, while imports will fall due to continued localisation of production. Consumer price inflation will remain low, and producer prices will continue to fall. Fiscal policy will become more supportive with a sizeable stimulus approved to finance the trade-in programme and social transfers, unprecedented in recent decades. Some major state-owned banks will be recapitalised to enable them to expand lending. Monetary policy will provide liquidity as needed. Easing prudential measures surrounding mortgage lending will support housing demand. Liberalisation in several services, including healthcare and childcare, and reforms to wage setting mechanisms to support higher wages will boost efficiency and potentially consumption. The social security system should be revamped to reduce precautionary savings and support consumption in a sustainable manner. Administrative monopolies as well as illegal fees should be abolished to unleash private sector potential. Growth has been stable despite the trade conflict Annual growth was broadly stable at 5.4% in the first quarter of 2025. Consumption has been supported by the expansion of the trade-in programme, now including smartphones in addition to home electronics. Manufacturing investment has remained stable, supported by strong industrial production, and infrastructure growth has been strong. Investment in real estate, however, continues to fall, as excess supply needs to be worked off. Declining food prices have kept inflation below zero. The producer price index has continued to fall.

The tariffs will disproportionately affect private companies, including foreign ones, as they are the major exporters. While exports have been boosted by front-loading since late 2024, imports have fallen. China’s retaliatory tariffs will affect imports from the United States. New and existing external restrictions on trade in specific products and investment will further impede Chinese trade with the United States and contribute to risks of supply-chain disruption in the longer term.

The headline fiscal balance is the official balance defined as the difference between revenues and outlays. Revenues include: general budget revenue, revenue from the central stabilisation fund and sub-national budget adjustment. Outlays include: general budget spending, replenishment of the central stabilisation fund and repayment of principal on sub-national debt. 132  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Fiscal stimulus is being stepped up and monetary policy remains supportive Fiscal policy has become more supportive in 2025 with the official budget deficit (which is the deficit on the major budget account out of the four accounts) planned to increase by one percentage point of GDP this year, a move unseen in the recent decade. Spending on social policies and transfers will increase, including on public health services, subsidies for citizen health insurance, raising the minimum citizen pension, child subsidies and making childcare services available countrywide. These policies, alongside the extension and expansion of the trade-in programme to include smartphones in addition to home appliances, will mostly benefit low-income groups, who have a higher propensity to consume. In addition, liberalisation of health, elderly care, childcare and household services will support consumption. A new wage-setting mechanism will help raise annual wage growth. Use by local governments of special bonds will be more flexible, boosting infrastructure spending. The debt burden of heavily indebted local governments is being alleviated and some consumption taxes are being assigned to the local level, although the core imbalance between revenue assignments and spending responsibilities at sub-national government levels has yet to be addressed, and local governments continue to face financial pressure from lower real estate prices. Fiscal policy is assumed to be broadly neutral in 2026. Monetary policy rates will remain low, and the authorities are ready to lower them or the reserve requirement ratio further if needed. There was a 10 basis point cut in the loan prime rates, the seven-day reverse repo rate and the interest rates for the standing lending facility as well as a 50 basis point cut in the reserve requirement ratio in May. Banks have started a new round of deposit rate cuts. Special treasury bonds are being issued to recapitalise some of the major state-controlled banks so that they can step up their lending to support the private sector. Prudential easing measures adopted in late 2024 will continue to support housing demand, including for second-hand housing. Growth will be held back by higher trade barriers Growth is expected to slow in 2025 and weaken further in 2026 due to higher trade barriers and the continuing adjustment in the real estate sector. The higher level of tariffs on trade with the United States will contribute to lower exports and imports, with the impact in 2025 mitigated by the front-loading of trade. The impact on trade will further be mitigated by lower administrative burdens on firms, the full VAT refund on exports, the critical nature of some trade and through increased trade to other markets. However, it will be dampened by weaker demand in China’s export markets due to higher uncertainty. Consumption will be supported by higher incomes and increased social spending. Inflation will remain low, despite a small boost form higher import prices. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside. While an easing of trade restrictions between China and the United States would improve the outlook, any further increase of trade restrictions internationally or a slowdown in other economies would slow export growth and industrial activity. The small boost to social transfers cannot replace social security reforms and may keep uncertainty and precautionary savings high. Potential further credit events may disrupt the orderly adjustment process in the real estate sector. Excessive relaxation of demand-side restrictions in the property sector could result in stronger growth, but also in a further build-up of imbalances and sharper adjustment in the future. Delaying addressing the funding gap at sub-national government levels may lead to further accumulation of implicit debt and costly resolution later. Fiscal expansion coupled with more stringent measures to raise spending efficiency may lift the impact of the spending and result in higher growth. Excessive subsidies to import-dependent high\u0002technology sectors that face high tariffs and other restrictions could temporarily boost those industries but would waste scarce fiscal resources and potentially lead to excess capacity. Reducing the mortgage burden and targeting low-income groups with transfers may result in somewhat higher consumption.  133 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Structural reforms could hold up growth in the medium term While China’s potential growth is slowing due to population ageing, there is ample room for structural reforms to keep growth at a reasonably strong level in the medium term. At the current juncture, a range of measures are being explored to mitigate the impact of US tariffs: VAT refund on exports, tariff cuts on other countries and lowering the administrative burden on enterprises and abolishing illegal fees, as there is little room to cut profit margins due to cut-throat competition in many manufacturing industries. In services, where markups are much higher, strengthening the Fair Competition Review Mechanism and abolishing local protectionism should be pursued. New social transfers will boost consumption, but bolder social security reforms are needed. Unemployment insurance coverage needs to be extended to all, and pensions should provide at least a minimum standard of living to all eligible people. Furthermore, the list of treatments and medicines covered by health insurance needs to be widened so that health costs do not push people into poverty. 134  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Colombia Growth will recover to 2.5% this year and 2.6% in 2026. Investment will continue growing as it recovers from a historical fall and as financial conditions ease, though uncertainty and a weak housing market will keep it subdued. Consumption and exports will moderate due to US tariffs and a global economic slowdown. The decline in inflation, temporarily interrupted in early 2025, will resume but inflation will stay above the 3% target throughout 2026. Monetary policy should continue its data-dependent, prudent easing cycle to ensure durable disinflation towards target. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain high in 2025 and 2026, requiring additional fiscal consolidation to abide by fiscal rules, debt stabilisation, and a reduction of high debt servicing costs due to large risk premia. In the medium term, reducing budget rigidities and a comprehensive tax reform are needed to rebuild fiscal space. Easing administrative burdens and improving infrastructure would help revitalise productivity and investment growth. Growth sustains its momentum In 2024, growth averaged 1.6% year-on-year but picked up to 3.7% (saar) in the final quarter. This momentum was largely sustained in the first quarter of 2025. Investment continued to recover from its sharp fall in 2023 and remained a main driver of growth. Soft indicators give mixed messages, with business sentiment fluctuating around its slightly upward 12-month trend but consumer sentiment softening since February. The labour market remains strong, with unemployment at 9.1% in March. Inflation has hovered around 5.2% since November, although core inflation continued to fall. With a slower-than\u0002expected path of disinflation, inflation expectations for end-2025 have increased, from 3.9% in October to 4.8% in May. Colombia 1.

Colombia has maintained its tariffs from the bilateral free trade agreement with the United States. The peso depreciated strongly (around 5%) in April but largely recovered in May. Lower oil prices will suppress exports and budget revenues, increasing pressures on an already tight fiscal position. Fiscal deficits and monetary policy rates will remain higher for longer The fiscal position has deteriorated sharply in 2024, with a 6.8% headline deficit and a 2.4% primary deficit. Deficits are projected to stay high at 6% in 2025 and 5.6% in 2026 based on current spending plans and medium-term revenues estimates. The government assumes a short-term increase in tax revenue of 2.4% of GDP from unidentified measures. Unless there is evidence that tax collection significantly exceeds its current level, spending cuts of at least 0.9% of GDP are needed to comply with the fiscal rule in 2025. The central bank paused its monetary easing cycle in the first quarter when inflation stabilised but resumed it with a 25 basis points cut in April. With a continuation of the cautious, data-dependent easing cycle, the policy rate is projected to decline to 7% by the end of 2026. Growth will be moderate, but with increasing downside risks The economy will grow at moderate rates of 2.5% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026. Investment will continue its recovery from a fall to below 17% of GDP, but uncertainty and a housing market downturn will prevent a full return to the pre-pandemic investment rate of 21%. Uncertainty will similarly subdue private consumption in 2025. With growth close to potential, unemployment will stay around its current level.

Inflation will gradually slow to 4.5% year-on-year by late 2025 and 3.8% by the end of 2026. Strong remittances and reinvested profits will keep the current account deficit contained. Risks are tilted to the downside. Uncertainty has already put downward pressure on the exchange rate in recent weeks, which could intensify, adding to inflationary pressures. Larger fiscal deficits and a failure to comply with the fiscal rule would further increase risk premia and already high sovereign interest payments and dampen investor confidence. Fiscal discipline would help mitigate uncertainty Cuts to planned expenditure are required to intensify fiscal consolidation, comply with the fiscal rule, and ensure debt sustainability. Diesel subsidies could be removed, following earlier commendable measures for petrol, and social spending could be better targeted. Spending reviews could help identify further room for raising spending efficiency. A comprehensive tax reform, involving reductions in tax expenditures, a shift from corporate to personal income taxes, tackling tax evasion, and reducing budget rigidities, would also help increase fiscal space. Measures to restore investment and revitalise productivity growth include lowering administrative burdens on businesses, improving transport infrastructure, building subnational government capacities, and strengthening macroeconomic governance, transparency, and policy certainty.  137 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Costa Rica GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025 and 2026, after 4.3% in 2024. Domestic demand will drive growth, while external demand will deteriorate following the introduction of a 10% tariff on Costa Rican goods exports to the United States, its main trading partner. Private consumption will remain solid due to incremental increases in disposable income and employment creation. Inflation is gradually rising towards the 3% target and will reach 1.8% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, as the gradual improvement in domestic conditions leads to a slow increase in domestic inflationary pressures. The fiscal situation has improved but ensuring fiscal sustainability requires the strict implementation of the fiscal rule to contain public spending, along with spending reviews to improve public spending efficiency and expansion of tax bases. The monetary policy rate will remain stable as inflation is gradually approaching the target rate. Continuing to expand trade opportunities via trade agreements that open new markets would help diversify Costa Rica’s concentrated export markets. Growth remains solid amid low inflation Strong net exports and domestic demand boosted GDP growth in the second half of 2024. Household consumption was supported by robust credit consumption growth (8.8% year-on-year in November 2024) and the increase in real wages (5.6% year-on-year in March 2025) and employment (2.5% year-on-year in March 2024). Investment also benefited from strong FDI inflows growing by 14% over the year in December. Economic activity remains robust, with the Monthly Index of Economic Activity increasing by 3.6% (year-on-year) in March 2025, driven by both traditional (utilities, transport) and special regime sectors (manufacturing). Headline inflation continues rising slowly and reached 0.4% (year-on-year) in April 2025. Core inflation is positive but low, at 0.9% in April. Costa Rica 1.

Services (tourism and business services) and semiconductors, a sizable part of Costa Rican exports to the United States, are excluded from the tariff. Perceived country risk, as measured by the Emerging Market Bond Index spread, averaged 2.1% in early May 2025, slightly above the 10-year historical low of around 2% in the first quarter of 2025. Monetary policy will maintain a neutral stance as fiscal policy remains prudent The monetary policy rate is expected to remain at 4% over the projection period, as inflation gradually increases towards the target rate of 3%, and in line with the neutral interest rate (estimated between 1% and 1.9%). The central government primary surplus is projected to remain positive (1.3% of GDP in both 2025 and 2026), as the fiscal rule constrains current expenditure growth. The central government budget deficit is projected to reach 3.3% of GDP in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, reflecting large public debt servicing costs of around 4.7% of GDP in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026. Public debt is expected to continue falling to 59.4% of GDP by end-2026. Trade tensions will slow growth GDP growth will slow to 3.1% in 2025 and 2026. Export growth will weaken in 2025 due to the US tariff on merchandise imports from Costa Rica and is expected to remain subdued in 2026, reflecting moderate global demand and higher trade costs.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Increasing violence and criminality may impact negatively tourism and FDI inflows. The high degree of dollarisation of Costa Rica’s economy, with credit in dollars on the rise recently and two thirds of the dollarised debt unhedged, exposes the country to external funding and exchange rate risks, notably against the US dollar. Escalation of geopolitical or trade tensions might provoke trade disruptions and further reduce external demand. On the upside, renewed efforts to deepen trade integration might strengthen net exports. Persevering with reforms will help ensure fiscal sustainability and support investment The fiscal outlook has improved but the fiscal rule should continue to be strictly implemented to limit public spending and further reduce fiscal sustainability risks. Spending reviews should be introduced and tax bases expanded to increase public spending efficiency and create fiscal space. Continuing efforts to open new markets for exports via trade agreements would help export diversification. Eliminating restrictions and caps on private sector participation in electricity generation and retail supply and removing barriers to foreign investment in the electricity sector would help attract investment required for meeting the increasing demand in electricity. Reorientating vocational training towards highly demanded skills (digital and technical) and increasing the number of STEM graduates would support investment, create better jobs and enhance growth. 140  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Croatia GDP is projected to grow by 2.9% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026. Private consumption growth will moderate as real income growth slows. High uncertainty and moderation in the absorption of EU Structural and Recovery and Resilience Funds will weigh on investment growth. Export growth will be affected by the weakening of foreign demand due to rising trade restrictions. Risks are related to an escalation in trade tensions, mainly through weakening demand from key European trading partners. Fiscal prudence is needed to support disinflation and rebuild fiscal buffers to prepare for the challenges of population ageing, the green transition and higher defence spending. Efforts to enhance the regulatory framework and judicial efficacy are needed to support investment amid high uncertainty. Policies to upskill and reskill the workforce would help alleviate skill shortages and support productivity growth. Economic growth is moderating GDP growth was strong in the last quarter of 2024, but high frequency indicators point to a moderation in the beginning of 2025. Consumer confidence remains subdued, and retail sales growth has continued to slow in early 2025, partly reflecting consumer boycotts of supermarkets and retailers over high food prices in January and February. Harmonised headline consumer price and core inflation moderated to 3.9% and 4.2% in April, respectively, but remain high. The labour market has started to cool.

Reduced VAT rates on energy were extended into 2025 and the list of food items subject to price caps was expanded amid high inflation. Mild fiscal consolidation is projected for 2026 as energy support and one-off measures are set to be phased out.

Prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms are needed Support to households affected by high energy and food prices should be better targeted to avoid fiscal policy further fuelling inflation. Enhancing the regulatory framework, including by clarifying responsibilities across government levels in land-use planning, creating a one-stop shop for land rights procedures, and promoting out-of-court dispute resolution, would reduce uncertainty and encourage investment. Efforts to increase labour force participation by older and younger workers, and to attract foreign workers, combined with effective upskilling and reskilling reforms, would help alleviate skill shortages and support productivity growth.  143 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Czechia GDP growth is set to pick up from 1% in 2024 to 1.9% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. The ongoing recovery in households’ real disposable income will support robust consumer demand. High trade policy uncertainty and trade restrictions, especially in the automotive sector, are weighing on investment and exports. The fiscal expansion in Germany and stronger use of EU funds will support faster growth in 2026. Headline inflation is projected to fall back gradually to the 2% target. Risks are tilted to the downside, related to a further escalation of trade tensions that could lead to lower growth. Given high uncertainty, monetary policy needs to remain vigilant. If inflationary pressures subside durably, the central bank should further ease policy interest rates. A broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate in the short-term, while spending efficiency needs to be improved in the medium-term to accommodate higher spending for defence, an ageing population and the green transition. Further developing the capital market and streamlining regulations to facilitate the entry and scaling up of firms can boost investment and business dynamism. Household consumption is driving growth GDP growth continued to expand robustly in the first quarter of 2025, by 0.5% compared to the previous quarter, helped by a strong recovery in household consumption. High frequency indicators point to some moderation of growth in the near term. Retail sales growth remained solid in March but economic sentiment declined markedly in April. The manufacturing purchasing managers index continued to recover from a subdued level in April but export orders declined. Falling interest rates supported a pick-up in loan growth to the private sector in the first quarter of 2025. Consumer price inflation eased to 1.8% in April 2025 as food price inflation abated, but service price inflation remained elevated at close to 5%. The labour market remains tight, with employment growth concentrated in the services sector. Labour shortages are contributing to continued strong wage growth. Czechia 1. 3-month moving average.

While direct trade exposure to the United States is limited, with goods exports to the United States accounting for around 3% of total exports in 2024, the recent increase in US tariffs will affect the economy via European manufacturing supply chains, especially for automotive parts. The koruna exchange rate has been relatively stable vis-à-vis the euro since the beginning of 2025. Monetary policy is slightly restrictive and fiscal policy is neutral in 2025 The central bank lowered its policy rate from 7% to 3.5% between December 2023 and May 2025. Monetary policy is projected to remain slightly restrictive in 2025 and broadly neutral in 2026, with the policy rate declining to 3%. The fiscal position has improved significantly, with the budget deficit falling from 3.8% of GDP in 2023 to 2.2% of GDP in 2024, helped by the phasing out of energy support measures and the implementation of a consolidation package. In line with the fiscal-structural plan the projections assume a neutral fiscal stance in 2025 and a moderately restrictive stance in 2026. Growth is set to pick up but uncertainty is high Robust private consumption growth supported by gains in real disposable income will be the main driver of growth in 2025. High trade policy uncertainty will weigh on investment growth this year but a stronger drawing of EU funds will support a pick-up in 2026. Export growth will be subdued due to the increase in trade restrictions, particularly in the automotive sector, which are offset only partly by the fiscal expansion 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Czechia Current prices CZK billion GDP at market prices 6 306.1 2.9 0.1 1.0 1.9 2.2 Private consumption 2 979.5 0.5 -2.7 2.1 3.1 2.8 Government consumption 1 318.7 0.4 3.4 3.3 2.1 1.3 Gross fixed capital formation 1 654.3 6.3 2.7 -1.4 -0.6 2.7 Final domestic demand 5 952.5 2.1 0.1 1.3 1.9 2.5 Stockbuilding¹ 119.4 1.2 -2.7 -0.9 0.8 0.0 Total domestic demand 6 071.9 3.3 -2.6 0.4 2.7 2.5 Exports of goods and services 4 446.9 5.2 3.1 1.5 1.0 2.2 Imports of goods and services 4 212.7 6.0 -0.6 0.7 2.0 2.6 Net exports¹ 234.2 -0.3 2.7 0.6 -0.6 -0.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 8.7 8.1 4.0 2.2 2.0 Consumer price index _ 15.1 10.7 2.4 2.4 2.1 Core inflation index² _ 12.2 7.7 4.0 2.8 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 2.2 2.6 2.6 2.7 2.6 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 11.5 13.1 12.2 11.4 9.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -3.1 -3.8 -2.2 -2.2 -1.9 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 45.9 48.6 49.4 50.5 51.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 42.5 42.4 43.6 44.6 45.3 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -4.7 -0.1 1.8 0.9 0.8 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 1.

Stronger productivity growth will mitigate labour cost growth and help ease inflation, which should fall back to target in 2026. Risks are tilted to the downside. A further escalation of trade and geopolitical tensions could depress confidence and foreign demand and lead to a resurgence of supply chain disruptions. Managing uncertainty through prudent macroeconomic policy Monetary policy needs to remain vigilant given the high uncertainty about future trade policy and the effects on prices, exchange rates and demand. If inflationary pressures durably subside, the central bank should further ease monetary restrictiveness. In this environment, the neutral fiscal stance in 2025 is broadly appropriate and automatic stabilisers should be allowed to work freely if downside risks materialise. In the medium-term, spending efficiency needs to improve to accommodate spending pressures related to military spending, population ageing and the green transition. For example, building capacity to regularly conduct spending reviews can help identify saving potential without harming outcomes but requires better access to data. Recent reforms to improve the overall sustainability of the pension system should be fully implemented. Further developing the capital market and streamlining regulations to facilitate the entry and scaling up of firms can boost investment and business dynamism. 146  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Denmark After a rebound to 3.7% in 2024, GDP growth is projected to moderate to 3.0% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. Rising household real disposable income will sustain consumption and housing investment. Export growth will be supported by the pharmaceutical sector and the reopening of gas fields but will nevertheless slow amid softer foreign demand. Business investment will lose momentum due to high uncertainty about the global trade outlook. Inflation is projected to decline from 1.9% in 2025 to 1.7% in 2026 as capacity pressures ease and wage growth moderates. Risks are to the downside, as further trade restrictions could hit key export sectors. The central bank is projected to gradually lower policy rates, matching the expected easing of euro area rates. Fiscal policy is expected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026, while maintaining fiscal space to respond to potential adverse economic shocks. Sustained public support to innovation and knowledge diffusion is needed to safeguard investment and competitiveness and facilitate the green and digital transitions amid rising uncertainty and risks. GDP growth has become more balanced GDP contracted by 0.5% in the first quarter of the year, mostly due to a fall in volatile pharmaceutical exports. Output recovered in non-pharmaceutical sectors and investment in building and construction rebounded. Available indicators suggest a softening of manufacturing activity in early 2025, with low demand identified by firms as the main production constraint. Labour market tightness remains elevated relative to historical norms but has eased. While household purchasing power has improved as employment and real wages have continued to grow; falling consumer confidence has restrained consumption appetite. Housing, energy and food prices have moderated; and headline and core inflation have fallen to around 1.5%. Wage growth has remained aligned with collective agreements and recent negotiations suggest it should slow to around 3.5% per year. House prices have recovered and now exceed their 2022 peak amid lower interest rates. Denmark Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; and Danmarks Statistik.

The impact of tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector is limited, as pharmaceutical exports are currently exempt from tariffs and there is substantial production in the United States. The slowdown in international trade flows will affect the maritime transport sector, already challenged by supply overcapacity. The outlook for the wind energy industry has been clouded by increasing investment costs and changes in US energy policy. Denmark is also dependent on prospects for demand in the euro area. Monetary and fiscal policies will be supportive The Danish central bank will follow anticipated rate cuts by the European Central Bank as part of the currency peg arrangement. Lower interest rates will support demand for credit. Stronger than expected labour market outcomes and exceptional revenues from corporate and pension taxes have led to another upward revision of the government balance in 2024. Rising spending on defence with the “Acceleration Fund” in 2025 and 2026 (0.8% of GDP) and personal income tax cuts (0.2% of GDP by 2026) will contribute to reducing the budget surplus. The fiscal impulse is projected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026, at over 2% of GDP, but additional spending on defence and falling tax revenues from firms operating abroad will have only a limited impact on the domestic economy. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Denmark Current prices DKK billion GDP at market prices 2 567.5 1.5 2.5 3.7 3.0 1.5 Private consumption 1 187.9 -2.1 1.4 0.9 1.1 1.6 Government consumption 613.5 -2.5 0.2 1.4 4.7 0.6 Gross fixed capital formation 578.3 2.8 -6.6 2.7 4.1 0.6 Final domestic demand 2 379.7 -1.0 -0.9 1.5 2.8 1.1 Stockbuilding¹ 27.7 0.6 -1.7 -1.0 0.1 0.1 Total domestic demand 2 407.4 -0.2 -2.7 0.7 3.1 1.2 Exports of goods and services 1 510.4 7.2 10.4 7.5 4.1 2.1 Imports of goods and services 1 350.2 4.4 3.7 3.0 4.0 1.8 Net exports¹ 160.1 1.9 5.1 3.3 0.5 0.4 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 9.1 -3.8 1.8 2.3 1.8 Consumer price index _ 7.7 3.3 1.4 1.9 1.7 Core inflation index² _ 4.0 4.3 1.4 1.5 1.7 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 4.5 5.2 6.3 6.8 6.8 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 3.5 3.0 2.1 2.8 2.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 3.4 3.3 4.5 2.4 1.8 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 40.1 39.8 36.7 34.0 32.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 34.1 33.6 31.1 28.4 26.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 11.7 9.8 13.0 12.5 12.2 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 1.

Exports will lose momentum due to slowing foreign demand, lowering the current account surplus. High uncertainty will weigh on business investment. Tensions on the labour market will ease and employment growth will stabilise. Private consumption will pick up gradually and housing investment will continue to recover, supported by real wage growth and tax reductions. After the rebound in early 2025 due to rising energy and food prices, headline inflation is expected to level off at 1.7% in 2026 in line with moderate labour cost growth and reduced capacity pressures. Economic prospects significantly rely on a few large firms, increasing the level of risks to the outlook. An introduction of tariffs on pharmaceuticals or transport services would further challenge key Danish firms. Stronger-than-expected growth in European main trading partners, following fiscal policy easing in Germany, could boost exports and help restore confidence. Policies should adapt to uncertain economic developments As fiscal space is large, with low public debt and a fiscal surplus, further fiscal policy easing could be envisaged if a further deterioration of the global trade outlook significantly hits the domestic economy. Efforts should concentrate on promoting productive investment for the green and digital transition. Reducing administrative burdens on firms, addressing skills shortages in strategic fields, including STEM, and streamlining processes to establish collaborations between businesses and universities would improve the business environment, stimulating investment and innovation capacities and maintaining high competitiveness. Clarifying government plans for the expansion of renewable energy and further accelerating network infrastructure developments would reduce uncertainty for investors in the energy sector.  149 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Estonia The economy will continue to recover with growth of 1.5% in 2025 and 2% in 2026, despite weaker external demand growth and ongoing tax increases. The recovery will be driven by consumption growth and higher public investment supported by EU funds. Inflation will pick up again in 2025 due to a VAT rise in July but moderate subsequently. Stronger spillovers from global trade developments and geopolitical tensions in the region pose downside risks. The slowing pace of tax increases is appropriate given unfolding global uncertainties, although medium-term fiscal pressures will need to be addressed. Investment in railway connections and electricity grid upgrades should be implemented without delay, as they can help boost the recovery and strengthen Estonia’s security. Increasing uptake of adult learning to drive the digital transition beyond ICT sector could help to improve competitiveness. Growth has resumed, despite headwinds The Estonian economy returned to growth in the middle of 2024, following two years of recession, with the upturn driven by trade and consumption. Although part of the growth in consumer spending was due to year-end car purchases in anticipation of a new vehicle tax this year, households have benefitted from a recovery in real incomes and lower interest rates. Preliminary estimates suggest GDP rose by 1.2% over the year to the first quarter of 2025, confirming the recovery despite growing headwinds. Inflation remained elevated at 4.4% in April, largely due to tax increases, higher prices for services and a pick-up in food prices. The unemployment rate remains high, while employment in manufacturing has started to increase. Business confidence indicators point to an improving outlook and consumer confidence has started to improve but remains subdued. Estonia 1. Excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco.

Trade growth has been sluggish due to the weakness in key export markets in the Nordic region, particularly in construction and manufacturing. Estonia’s direct exposure to trade with the United States is modest, although indirect linkages due to demand from the European market are more significant. The budget deficit has narrowed but will deteriorate again Falling interest rates will support the nascent recovery, but ongoing tax increases will weigh on household consumption. Last year, the budget deficit narrowed to 1.5% of GDP and will remain at a similar level this year. Increases in value added tax (VAT) and excise duties under way will weigh on consumption and temporarily raise headline inflation in the middle of the year. Next year, fiscal policy will ease significantly, and the budget deficit will deteriorate to 3% of GDP, with defence spending set to reach 5 % of GDP from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 and an increase in personal income tax allowance, despite further increases in the rates of personal and corporate income taxes. EU structural funds, targeted at the green and digital transitions of the economy, should strengthen public investment and provide funding for upskilling opportunities and energy-saving measures. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Estonia Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 31.4 0.0 -3.1 -0.2 1.5 2.0 Private consumption 15.8 2.7 -1.6 0.0 1.8 1.9 Government consumption 6.3 -1.4 0.7 0.4 0.2 1.4 Gross fixed capital formation 9.1 -10.3 8.7 -6.7 -0.6 6.5 Final domestic demand 31.2 -2.0 1.7 -1.6 0.8 3.0 Stockbuilding¹ 0.6 1.7 -3.3 1.2 2.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 31.8 -0.6 -1.7 -0.6 2.9 3.0 Exports of goods and services 25.0 5.1 -9.0 -1.1 2.3 2.1 Imports of goods and services 25.4 5.1 -6.6 -0.1 3.2 3.4 Net exports¹ - 0.4 -0.1 -1.9 -0.8 -0.6 -1.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 15.9 8.2 3.6 2.7 1.0 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 19.4 9.1 3.7 4.2 2.3 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 10.3 8.7 5.1 4.0 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 5.6 6.4 7.5 7.8 7.6 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ -1.6 -0.3 -1.3 0.4 4.2 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -1.1 -3.1 -1.5 -1.5 -3.0 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 26.9 29.6 33.4 32.6 35.4 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 19.1 20.2 23.6 22.8 25.7 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -4.3 -2.2 -1.5 -2.3 -2.9 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 2.

It will be supported by monetary policy easing in the euro area and a pick-up in demand from the Nordic trading partners, as well as by public investment. Much of the defence expenditure increase will be spent on equipment purchases from abroad. Increased uncertainty stemming from both Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and global trade tensions will continue to keep business investment muted. Inflation will temporarily rise in the second half of the year because of tax increases but decline thereafter to 2.3% in 2026. The recovery could be derailed by a worsening of spillovers from global trade developments and geopolitical tensions in the region. More persistent inflationary pressures and wage demands are upside risks to inflation. Reforms are needed to ensure sustainable financing of new spending and enhance competitiveness Given high global uncertainties, the planned more gradual pace of tax increases seems appropriate. The distributional impact of the increased tax burden should be carefully assessed. Higher defence expenditures and spending pressures from an ageing population will eventually require new sources of revenue, which could come for instance from an annual tax on property. Ongoing expenditure reviews should continue. Public investment projects such as international railway connections and electricity grid upgrades can help strengthen Estonia’s security and should be implemented without delay. To advance the digital transition among businesses beyond the ICT sector and contribute to improving competitiveness, it will be important to increase the uptake of adult learning. 152  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Euro area GDP growth is projected to strengthen to 1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026 as foreign demand recovers. Private consumption will be supported by sustained growth of real disposable incomes. Private investment will be constrained by high uncertainty but will benefit from improved financing conditions; public investment will be supported by the Recovery and Resilience Facility funds. Wage growth is projected to ease gradually, helping core inflation to return to 2% by the second half of 2025. Fiscal policy will tighten in 2025 and remain broadly neutral in 2026, as countries make use of the national escape clauses under the new fiscal rules. Although defence spending is set to rise and debt financing could be required in the short term, prudent fiscal policy is needed to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy should remain prudent to ensure that inflation is durably reduced to target. Reducing regulatory burdens on labour mobility would help alleviate labour shortages, while progress on financial integration could boost cross-border financial flows, lifting private investment. The economy remains resilient amid increasing global uncertainty. GDP grew by 0.3% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2025. Recent indicators suggested some rebound in the economy, but the composite PMI declined in May, reflecting weakening in services and only modestly improving activity in manufacturing. Headline inflation stood at 2.2% in April, unchanged from March. Core inflation increased to 2.7% in April, from 2.4% in March, partly driven by the timing of Easter, but market and survey-based inflation expectations have remained broadly stable at the 2% target since December 2024. Services inflation also increased in April, to 4% in annual terms, up from 3.5% in March. The labour market is gradually normalising, with both employment growth and nominal wage growth slowing in the fourth quarter of 2024. At the same time, the euro area seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained low at 6.2% in March. Financial conditions continue to be mildly restrictive, with the corporate demand for loans decreasing, but a continuing rebound in housing loans and other lending to households. The number of bankruptcies fell slightly in the fourth quarter of 2024, from a high level in the first half of the year. Benign energy prices and increasing exports of chemicals and manufactured goods brought the goods trade surplus to EUR 44 billion or 0.3% of euro area GDP in March. Exports were affected by front-loading amid growing trade frictions and elevated geopolitical tensions. At the same time, the balance of services trade remained positive, and the current account surplus for the last 12 months increased to 2.9% of GDP in March. Energy commodity prices have decreased, but the recovery from the recent energy price shock has been uneven, with output and profits of energy-intensive firms decreasing. The US has introduced a 10% tariff on imports of EU goods, with a 25% tariff on imports of steel and aluminium and cars and car parts. The EU postponed its countermeasures for 90 days in April. In support of Ukraine, EU countries have extended temporary protection to more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees until March 2026, helping to reduce labour shortages in certain sectors. The EU has disbursed almost EUR 20 billion (0.1% of euro area GDP) from the EUR 50 billion Ukraine Facility and approved an additional loan of up to EUR 35 billion (0.2% of euro area GDP), financed by proceeds from frozen Russian assets.  153 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Euro area 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/maqz6b Macroeconomic policy is to become less restrictive The aggregate euro area fiscal stance is projected to tighten by about ¼% of GDP in 2025 and remain broadly unchanged in 2026. The fiscal measures to stem the effects of the energy crisis have been withdrawn, while spending under the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) programme could provide support of about 1% of GDP in 2025 and 2026. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has triggered additional military spending and the EU fiscal rules were relaxed by allowing the coordinated use of national escape clauses for up to 1.5% of GDP per year for defence purposes, enabling additional spending of about EUR 650 billion (4.3% of euro area GDP) over the next four years. In addition, the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) instrument will allow EU countries to borrow up to EUR 150 billion to facilitate the increase in defence spending. The European Central Bank’s monetary policy stance has become less restrictive, as the deposit facility rate has been cut by a cumulative 175 basis points since June 2024, to 2.25% in April 2025. The policy rate is projected to decrease further, reaching 1.75% in the latter part of 2025. While the interest rate cuts will support aggregate demand, the overall policy stance is projected to remain cautious for some time to durably reduce inflation to the 2% target. The short-term inflationary pressures stem from labour shortages and additional public expenditure under the NGEU programme, estimated to total 2.5% of GDP by end-2026. Economic growth will strengthen as domestic demand picks up Growth is projected to strengthen, supported by easing financial conditions and lower energy prices. The labour market will remain tight, with labour shortages in some occupations and historically low unemployment slowing down wage growth normalisation. Growing real disposable incomes will support consumption, albeit at a slowing rate as disinflation comes to an end. Elevated uncertainty related to trade tensions will weigh on private investment, but public investment will be supported by spending under the NGEU programme. Headline inflation is projected to moderate further, as labour cost pressures gradually dissipate. Core inflation is also projected to decline, returning to the level consistent with the ECB inflation target by mid-2026.  155 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Risks to the projections are tilted to the downside. Worsening trade tensions, such as an increase in US reciprocal tariffs and possible EU countermeasures, would weigh on external demand, while the tariffs already in place could trigger unfavourable trade diversion flows towards the euro area. Trade retaliation measures by the EU could add to inflationary pressures. Financial stability risks continue to exist in the euro area, with pockets of financial vulnerabilities in the commercial real estate and nonbanking financial sector. On the upside, a stronger use of accumulated household savings could strengthen private consumption. In addition, a durable reduction of geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions could hasten disinflation and help lift external demand. Structural reforms are needed to complement prudent macroeconomic policies The investment needs associated with defence, energy security and decarbonisation are considerable. While defence spending is set to rise, it should not be financed by debt issuance in the long term. Reprioritisation of fiscal spending and prudent fiscal policy will be needed to rebuild fiscal buffers and address other spending pressures, such as population ageing. Effective disbursement of the NGEU funds will help expand medium-term productive capacity but it is associated with short-term inflationary risks that need to be monitored at the EU level. The new EU fiscal rules encourage structural reforms and safeguards for medium-term fiscal sustainability, but the impending activation of the national escape clauses may further delay reduction of existing excessive deficits. To ensure a level playing field and effective use of public funds, state-aid rules should not be relaxed further. The monetary policy stance should not be eased prematurely and macroprudential instruments should be used to address potential financial sector vulnerabilities. Furthermore, labour shortages could be alleviated by attracting high-skilled non-EU workers and by reducing regulatory and administrative burdens on intra-EU mobility. Finally, progress on the Capital Markets Union and the banking union could help boost cross-border financial flows, lifting private investment. 156  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Finland The Finnish economy is set to grow by 0.7% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026 after contracting by 0.1% in 2024. Lower interest rates will support private consumption and investment, notwithstanding subdued confidence. Inflation is projected to remain modest, as lower energy prices and weak activity offset pressures from rising import costs. Imports should recover gradually, while export growth will be dampened by trade restrictions and lower global growth. Unemployment will remain elevated in 2025 before gradually declining. Russian hybrid warfare, including infrastructure sabotage and cyber-attacks, and escalating trade barriers continue to be key risks. Fiscal consolidation remains essential to place public debt on a downward path, amid rising pressures from population ageing and growing defence and security needs. Priorities include improving the efficiency of spending, particularly in health, and further normalising reduced VAT rates once the recovery is firmly underway. Boosting private R&D investment, expanding the pool of high-skilled workers through a more effective allocation of study places and better integration of foreign talent, as well as enhancing investment in renewable energy, will be key to strengthen innovation and investment and revive productivity. Weak confidence and high unemployment continue to weigh on the recovery Economic activity is gradually recovering. GDP grew in the first three quarters of 2024 but stalled in the fourth quarter, mainly due to sluggish private consumption and investment, before rising by an estimated 0.1% in the first quarter of 2025. Consumer and business confidence remain below long-term averages, particularly in construction. The unemployment rate stood at 9.5% in March, up from 8.4% a year earlier, reflecting continued weakness in construction and job losses in the public sector. Both headline and core inflation have picked up somewhat in 2025, although lower energy prices and subdued domestic demand are helping to contain underlying inflationary pressures. Wage growth moderated in 2024 after strong gains in 2023, but nominal earnings still outpaced inflation. House prices have stabilised after earlier declines, while falling interest rates are reducing household mortgage expenses. Finland 1. Real price index of old dwellings in housing companies.

Weak demand in key trading partners has dampened exports, while escalating trade restrictions, including the 10% US import tariffs on EU goods and increasing geoeconomic fractures have heightened uncertainty. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine continues to weigh on regional stability and the economic recovery. Russian hybrid warfare threats, including cyberattacks and infrastructure sabotage, have undermined business sentiment. The fiscal stance needs to tighten more Fiscal policy is set to tighten gradually in 2025, following an expansionary stance in 2024, with consolidation of a bit over ½ per cent of GDP. The fiscal deficit widened to 4.4% of GDP in 2024, driven by rising pension costs and spending pressures from health and defence, which were only partly offset by higher revenue from the increase in the standard VAT rate in September. Most wellbeing services counties, which assumed responsibility for social welfare and healthcare from municipalities in 2023, continue to record deficits despite efforts to reduce staffing. Ongoing consolidation, including spending cuts in social welfare programmes, is projected to reduce the deficit to 3.7% this year. The General Government Fiscal Plan for 2026–29 announced in April will slow the pace of consolidation. The plan includes cuts to personal and corporate income tax rates and a rise in defence spending, from 2.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3% by 2029, part of which will be implemented only after the 2026 projection horizon. Abstracting from the uncertain dynamic effects of tax cuts, these measures widen the fiscal gap by around 1.7% of GDP. With European Central Bank policy rates gradually declining, retail interest rates in Finland have been adjusting swiftly, given the high share of variable-rate mortgages, which will help drive a moderate recovery. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Finland Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 248.8 0.8 -0.9 -0.1 0.7 1.1 Private consumption 125.3 0.9 0.0 -0.1 0.0 1.7 Government consumption 61.7 -0.6 3.4 0.7 0.1 0.1 Gross fixed capital formation 60.7 1.5 -7.4 -7.1 -0.2 3.9 Final domestic demand 247.7 0.7 -1.0 -1.5 0.0 1.8 Stockbuilding¹ , ² 0.9 2.0 -3.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 248.6 2.8 -4.0 -0.8 0.0 1.7 Exports of goods and services 99.3 4.4 0.2 0.1 0.6 -0.7 Imports of goods and services 99.2 9.3 -6.7 -2.4 -0.2 0.9 Net exports¹ 0.1 -1.9 3.3 1.1 0.3 -0.7 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 3.5 1.4 1.6 1.9 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 7.2 4.3 1.0 1.8 1.9 Harmonised index of core inflation³ _ 3.6 4.1 2.2 2.5 2.0 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 6.8 7.3 8.4 9.1 8.7 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 1.5 2.0 2.8 4.1 4.3 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -0.2 -3.0 -4.4 -3.7 -3.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 81.4 85.6 90.4 93.7 96.3 General government debt, Maastricht definition⁴ (% of GDP) _ 74.0 77.5 82.1 85.4 88.0 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -2.4 -0.4 0.1 -0.2 -0.9 Percentage changes, volume (2015 prices) 3.

Lower interest rates, rising real wages and stabilising house prices are expected to support private consumption. Investment is also set to recover gradually, although heightened uncertainty, persistent weakness in construction and elevated unemployment may continue to weigh on domestic demand. Exports are projected to slow due to increasing trade restrictions and weak trading partner growth. Inflation is expected to remain moderate, at around 2% in 2025 and 2026, as rising import costs are partly offset by lower energy prices. The recovery is fragile and risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. A further escalation of global trade tensions could weaken export performance and delay investment. The persistent geopolitical rift with Russia may dampen confidence and foreign investment. On the upside, positive spillovers from stronger-than-expected investment in the green industrial transition or higher-than-anticipated large-scale defence and industrial orders, such as for steel and icebreakers, could lift growth above current projections. Facilitating investment and expanding the skilled workforce are key to boosting productivity Stepping up fiscal consolidation is key to reversing the rise in public debt and rebuilding fiscal buffers in the face of population ageing and growing security needs. Improving the efficiency of public spending, particularly in the health sector and wellbeing services counties, remains essential for achieving debt sustainability. Further normalising reduced VAT rates as the recovery gains traction would help broaden the tax base and raise revenue. Strengthening investment through government support, such as R&D tax credits, and improving regulatory predictability, especially in renewable energy, forestry and clean technologies, will spur Finland’s green industrial transition, where the country holds vast potential. Additionally, expanding the supply of high-skilled labour through better allocation of higher education places, faster completion rates, and more effective attraction and integration of foreign talent would also help boost innovation, investment and productivity.  159 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 France After growing below potential in 2023-24, at 1.1%, GDP growth is set to slow further to 0.6% in 2025 due to heightened economic policy uncertainty, before gradually recovering to 0.9% in 2026. Private consumption will become the main growth engine in 2025, as exports will suffer from increased trade tensions and investment will be held back by increased uncertainty. The recovery in 2026 is set to be supported by stronger investment and steady consumer spending. Inflation is expected to fall to 1.2% in 2025, driven by cuts in electricity tariffs, before edging up to 1.7% in 2026. The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow gradually to 5.4% and 5% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, from 5.8% of GDP in 2024. As the associated fiscal effort, of 1% of GDP in 2025, would be the largest in over a decade, there is a significant risk of fiscal slippages. Weaker-than-expected growth and rising defence spending would also make it harder to reach fiscal targets. Public debt is projected to remain high at nearly 120% of GDP in 2026. Stabilisation will require continued deficit reduction and growth-enhancing reforms. To unlock greater investment, structural reforms should prioritise digital uptake, simplifying regulations in the services sector and better targeting of innovation support towards innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. Activity has slowed amidst rising policy uncertainty Economic activity grew by 1.1% in 2024, reflecting a degree of resilience amid a challenging policy environment, heightened uncertainty after a government no-confidence vote, and a mild output fall in the fourth quarter that reduced the 2025 carry-over. GDP rebounded moderately in the first quarter of 2025, driven primarily by inventory accumulation, while private consumption stagnated and both investment and net exports both declined. However, business investment has stabilised since two quarters, after nearly five consecutive quarters of decline. Indicators remain gloomy though. Business confidence has remained below its long-term average since August 2024, while household confidence hit its lowest since the Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine began. The labour market has worsened, with employment falling by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Inflation decreased faster than expected at the end of 2024 and early 2025, reaching 0.9% year-on-year in April, helped by lower regulated tariffs on electricity in February. Core inflation continues to be higher than headline inflation. Business uncertainty has risen due to the lack of clarity around the tariffs imposed by the United States and potential retaliation by other major economies. France’s direct exposure to higher US tariffs on EU goods is relatively limited, with the US accounting for 5% of exports and 5.3% of imports of goods. However, France remains highly vulnerable to a broader slowdown in global demand, especially in Europe, which is the destination for 55% of its exports. 160  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 France 1 Source: www.policyuncertainty.com; and Banque de France.

Year-on-year growth rates. Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. StatLink 2https://stat.link/spxefh Credit conditions will improve while fiscal policy will tighten The fiscal deficit is projected to have been 5.8% of GDP in 2024, slightly lower than earlier expectations. The government is targeting a reduction to 5.4% of GDP in 2025, requiring a 1% improvement in the structural primary balance, with additional measures beyond the current Budget. If fully implemented, this would be the strongest improvement since 2010. A consolidation effort in line with the government’s announcements is incorporated in the projections. Most of the consolidation will come from higher taxes, including exceptional taxes on high-income earners and large profitable firms, as well as on air travel and high-emitting vehicles. On the spending side, measures include a slowdown in municipal spending, cuts in central government spending, lower subsidies for low-wage workers, reductions in sick leave benefits and a tightening of unemployment benefits. No detailed consolidation plan has been set for 2026; an effort of 0.7% of GDP is assumed, though rising defence spending may hinder this. Since mid-2024, European Central Bank policy interest rate cuts have eased lending conditions, gradually supporting business and housing investment. However, private sector debt repayments remain high because of fixed-rate loans from the earlier high-interest period. The interest rate on new housing loans (excluding renegotiations) declined to 3.2% in March, the lowest level since May 2023, while new loan rates to businesses fell to 3.76%, 95 basis points lower than a year ago. The sovereign spread between France and Germany also narrowed to 68 basis points in May, almost 20 basis points below its December 2024 peak amid political turmoil. Nevertheless, it remains elevated relative to its long-term average, reflecting ongoing concerns over debt and economic policy uncertainty. High economic policy uncertainty will delay the rebound in growth Economic growth is expected to slow significantly in 2025, with the output gap widening throughout the next two years, driven by heightened uncertainty and rising trade tensions. The contribution of exports to growth will weaken. Private consumption will be supported by disinflation, transfers indexed on past inflation and a lower saving rate—though real income gains will be tempered by a slowing in wage catch- 162  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 up compared to 2024 and higher taxes on income. Unemployment is expected to rise with the slowdown in growth. The social assistance (RSA) reform requiring beneficiaries to register with public employment services and actively search for a job will add upward pressure on the unemployment rate while tighter low-wage subsidies may also reduce the employability of this group. Business investment will remain subdued over 2025 and will only gradually recover towards the end of the year, given weak trade prospects and policy uncertainty. Residential investment is expected to turn positive from mid-2025, following a progressive rise in building permits since the last quarter of 2024. Ahead of municipal elections, public investment is expected to rise in 2025, albeit at a slower pace. Inflation is expected to ease further in 2025, as economic activity slows and tariffs on US imports only have a limited impact due to France’s low exposure to the US market. The gap between headline and core inflation is expected to narrow as energy prices stabilise and services inflation eases. Risks are tilted to the downside. Higher tariffs on French exports and those of its key partners, especially in Europe, could weaken growth further. Retaliatory trade measures could push inflation higher. A softer stance on fiscal consolidation would support growth but push up the public debt ratio, raising bond yields and crowding out private investment. The risk of renewed policy turmoil later this year – due to the absence of a clear majority in the National Assembly – and the resulting uncertainty over fiscal policy may further constrain firms’ investment decisions. Stabilising debt and raising potential output call for broad-based reforms Sticking to fiscal consolidation plans is essential for France to stabilise and reduce public debt. While efforts so far have focused on tax increases, achieving medium-term fiscal targets will require a broader strategy, including spending cuts, shifting the tax structure toward less distortive taxes and implementing structural reforms to boost potential growth. Greater support for the labour market participation of older workers should focus on lifelong learning, especially investment in digital skills. Accelerating investment in digital technologies, especially among SMEs, requires boosting fibre adoption by clarifying tariffs and service offers, and by lowering installation costs. The innovation ecosystem is strong and dynamic but incentives for research and development should be more directed towards SMEs with high potential for breakthrough innovation. Further streamlining administrative procedures, easing regulatory barriers to market entry and simplifying regulations in key service sectors would stimulate competition and attract new capital.  163 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Germany The economy is projected to grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. Private consumption will increase due to low inflation, rising nominal wages and decreasing domestic policy uncertainty following the formation of a new government. High trade policy uncertainty will hamper investment in export-oriented manufacturing but, overall, private investment will pick up, supported by high corporate savings, declining interest rates and lower domestic policy uncertainty. Public investment in defence and infrastructure will rise strongly due to the increased flexibility in the fiscal rules and large investment needs. Rising US tariffs will weigh on foreign demand. Ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability requires improved public spending efficiency, reallocation of spending and broadening the tax base, while addressing rising spending pressures due to rapid population ageing. Continuing to reduce the administrative burden, digitalise the public administration and improve infrastructure implementation capacity, particularly at the municipal level, is needed to support the pick-up in public and private investment. To avoid rising inflationary pressures due to the significant demand shock from fiscal easing, it is key to reduce barriers to firm entry and growth and address skilled labour shortages. Weak external demand and high uncertainty have weighed on economic activity Real GDP increased by 1.7% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (saar) in the first quarter of 2025, mainly driven by private consumption and investment. Energy prices remain higher than before the war in Ukraine, particularly affecting output in energy-intensive industries. Monthly manufacturing production increased by 3% in March and was 0.2% below the level a year earlier. Despite an increase of real wages by 3.1% in 2024, the recovery of private consumption has been slow due to high domestic policy uncertainty. However, since the federal elections in February and a reform of the fiscal rules in March, policy uncertainty has declined. The ifo business expectations indicator has increased since March, despite higher trade policy uncertainty. Retail sale volumes decreased in March by 0.2% but stood 2.2% above the previous year’s level. Annual headline inflation declined to 2.2 % in April from 2.3% in March, mainly driven by declining energy prices. However, core inflation remains sticky, at 3.1% in April, due to strong services price inflation of 4.5% driven by strong nominal wage gains. Although labour markets have cooled, they remain robust with low unemployment and high vacancies still signalling strong labour shortages. Rising trade protection and increasing competition from China in key export markets have weighed on export volumes, which strongly declined in the second half of 2024. However, in March 2025, nominal exports were 2.3% above the level observed one year earlier, helped by rising export prices and a structural shift in manufacturing towards higher value-added products. The recent rise in uncertainty about future US trade policy also led to a front-loading of exports in the first quarter of 2025. Higher US tariffs will strongly affect manufacturing firms as about 10% of total goods exports are shipped to the United States. 164  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Germany 1 Source: Federal Statistical Office; Bundesbank; ifo business surveys; and GfK.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1qpxgz Defence spending and infrastructure investment are set to increase strongly The fiscal stance will tighten by 0.3% of GDP in 2025 and expand by 0.9% of GDP in 2026. Due to the fall of the previous coalition government and failure to conclude negotiations on the 2025 budget, a provisional budget for 2025 extends nominal spending levels from 2024 to 2025. However, a recent reform of the national fiscal rules will allow for raising investments in defence and infrastructure in the next few years. Additional spending exceeding 1% of GDP in the areas of defence, civil protection, intelligence services, protection of IT systems, and support for states attacked in violation of international law will be exempted from the fiscal rules. A special infrastructure fund will provide up to EUR 500 bn or about 12% of GDP for additional investment in infrastructure and the green transformation over the next 12 years. Moreover, the structural deficit ceiling for sub-national governments will be raised from 0% to 0.35% of GDP, and EUR 100 billion from the new infrastructure fund will be allocated to fund local public investment. The effects of this reform on public investment are expected to start materialising only in 2026 as the approval of the 2025 and 2026 budget and detailed investment plans as well as infrastructure planning and procurement procedures will take time. Negotiations to form a new coalition government have been successful. The policy plans laid out in the coalition treaty emphasise the need to strengthen defence and internal security, address the large infrastructure backlog, revive the stagnating economy, modernise and digitalise the public administration, and address skilled labour shortages. It is planned to raise depreciation allowances for equipment investment, reduce the electricity tax and network charges, raise subsidies for energy-intensive firms, and support the car industry by increasing subsidies for electric vehicles and the commuter allowance. Labour supply incentives are planned to be raised by exempting additional income from working extra-hours, wage premia if switching from part-time to full time work, and earnings of workers above the statutory retirement age from labour taxes. 166  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The recovery will be driven by domestic demand GDP will grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. Private consumption will increase due to low inflation, rising nominal wages and declining domestic policy uncertainty. High trade policy uncertainty will hamper investment in export-oriented manufacturing but, overall, private investment will pick up, supported by high corporate savings, declining interest rates and decreasing domestic policy uncertainty, including on the financing of measures to support firms during the green transition. Public investment in defence and infrastructure will rise strongly due to the increased flexibility in the fiscal rules and large investment needs. Rising US tariffs will weigh on export demand. Headline inflation will converge towards 2% in 2026, but core inflation will be sticky, reflecting the impact of wage gains amidst skilled labour shortages and rising public investment and domestic demand. A further escalation in trade policy tensions would weigh on GDP, as the manufacturing sector is strongly integrated in global supply chains and the United States is the main export market. If public procurement and infrastructure planning and approval procedures are not accelerated, the implementation of public investment projects will be delayed, reducing GDP growth in 2026. Moreover, if structural reforms to support the supply side of the economy are not implemented, the significant demand shock from increased public investment may lead to strongly rising inflationary pressures. Structural reforms should complement the reform of fiscal rules Further simplification and harmonisation of public procurement, infrastructure planning and approval procedures should be combined with improvements to the capacity of public administration, particularly at the local level. This will ensure a quick and efficient implementation of public investment projects. To avoid rising inflationary pressures, it is key to combine the reform of the fiscal rules with structural reforms. Reducing high administrative burdens and regulatory barriers to entry and growth of firms, particularly in construction and services, is key to strengthen competition and revive business dynamism, investment and innovation. This will require accelerating the digitalization of the public administration, including by setting mandatory common IT standards, and expanding efforts to review, simplify and harmonise existing regulations and administrative procedures across levels of government. Occupational entry regulations and licensing requirements to open a business should be reduced to strengthen competition. Shifting the tax burden away from labour towards capital income and wealth, for example by reducing inheritance tax exemptions for business assets, would help improve labour supply incentives. Reducing fiscal incentives for early retirement would improve work incentives for older workers and help to stabilise pension spending amidst rising fiscal pressures due to ageing. To address skilled labour shortages, it is key to expand training opportunities for workers and the unemployed, including support for completing formal VET degrees.  167 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Greece GDP growth is projected to remain resilient at 2.0% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Disbursements of EU Recovery and Resilience Funds will strengthen investment, and minimum wage increases will support a pick-up in consumption, as exports slow alongside external demand. Headline inflation will ease to 2.0% in 2026, helped by lower oil prices, despite rising trade costs and persistent services inflation. Implementation delays of EU funds, excessive wage growth or renewed extreme weather events could dampen the outlook. Sizeable primary fiscal surpluses are projected in 2025 and in 2026, at 2.1% and 2.2% of GDP respectively, underpinned by improved tax compliance. Keeping public debt on a firmly declining path should remain a priority, as ageing costs and investment needs add to future spending pressures. Maintaining the reform momentum to improve the business environment and ease high labour shortages would support investment growth. Continuing efforts to reduce tax evasion and limit tax expenditures would raise revenues, while making room to reduce the labour tax on low-wage earners, and encouraging further employment gains. The economy remains strong The economy grew by 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by investment. Business expectations in manufacturing and service sectors have softened but continued to point towards expansion in April 2025. Employment rose by 0.5% in the year to March 2025, while nominal wages grew by 5.4% in the year to the fourth quarter of 2024, with labour shortages remaining historically high. Annual headline inflation remained elevated at 2.6% in April 2025 and core inflation stood at 3.8%, driven by services price inflation.

Lending to non-financial corporations from August 2024 to March 2025 was 14% higher than a year earlier. Interest rates for new loans to households and firms fell from 5.7% in August 2024 to 4.3% in March 2025. The trade deficit widened in 2024, with import growth outpacing exports amidst moderate growth in tourism. Travel receipts over the second half of 2024 were 1.8% higher than a year earlier, down from high growth rates in previous years, and exports of goods in the fourth quarter of 2024 were 3.3% lower compared than a year earlier. Trade links with the United States are limited, but new US tariffs will also weigh on exports by lowering demand from trading partners such as Germany. Fiscal policy will remain supportive The fiscal stance will remain supportive, as disbursements of Recovery and Resilience grants and loans are projected to rise from 1.8% of GDP in 2024 to 3.6% in 2026. Stronger tax revenues, bolstered by enhanced tax collection measures, are projected to support sustained primary surpluses and create room for additional spending. A primary surplus of 2.1% of GDP in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026 will contribute to a further decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 140% in 2026 (Maastricht definition). New fiscal measures for 2025 include a reduction in social security contributions by 1 percentage point (0.2% of 2024 GDP) and permanent increases of incomes for pensioners (0.2% of GDP) and public servants (0.1% of GDP).

Public sector wages, which were frozen, are being raised to align with the rising minimum wage. Growth will remain resilient GDP growth is projected to remain resilient at 2.0% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Rising disposable income will support a pick-up in consumption. Investment growth, supported by growing disbursements of Recovery and Resilience Funds, will remain robust despite heightened international uncertainty. Rising labour shortages will moderate employment growth while supporting rising wages. New US tariffs and easing external demand, notably from EU trading partners, will slow export growth. Headline inflation is projected to return slowly towards 2.0% in 2026 amidst persistent core inflation. Implementation delays of the Recovery and Resilience Plan “Greece 2.0” could put the planned investment growth at risk. If wage growth were to persistently outpace productivity gains, this could weaken exports further. Extreme weather events, such as the 2023 floods in Thessaly, could also weigh on domestic demand. Strengthening investment further is a key challenge The still high public debt level poses risks in the medium-term, while population ageing and climate change add to future domestic spending pressures. Low productivity continues to hold back competitiveness and living standards. Boosting investment will be key to strengthening growth while maintaining public debt on a firmly declining path. This will require an easing of remaining regulatory burdens and improvements in workers’ skills. Formalising and accelerating the review of existing business regulations while ensuring an effective consultation of stakeholders on new legislation would help continue recent success with making the regulatory framework more business friendly. Strengthening vocational training, rebalancing labour market policies towards training and counselling for unemployed workers and ensuring high training quality would reduce skill mismatches. Further reducing tax evasion and limiting tax expenditures – notably reduced VAT rates, which mostly benefit wealthy households – would raise revenue, making room for targeted social contribution cuts to strengthen work incentives. 170  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Hungary After growing by 0.5% in 2024, GDP is projected to increase by 0.9% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026. Private consumption, supported by real wage growth, will be the main engine of growth, especially in 2025. Following a significant decline in 2024, investment is expected to increase gradually but will remain hampered by weak economic prospects and trade policy uncertainty. Exports are projected to pick-up in line with demand from Hungary’s main trading partners, but growth in the euro area, particularly Germany, is a key risk for the economy. Monetary policy easing is expected to continue, but at a moderate pace to ensure that inflation reverts back to target. While necessary to prepare for rising ageing-related spending needs, fiscal consolidation is weakening. Better financing conditions, lower trade policy uncertainty and full implementation of recent public integrity reforms will be key to support a rebound in investment. Reforming the insolvency framework would facilitate capital reallocation towards productive investments. Improving regulations in energy, transport and professional services would encourage business creation. Economic activity is weak Economic growth has been volatile since 2023, with alternating quarters of positive and negative GDP growth. In 2024 as a whole, GDP growth was only 0.5% and GDP declined by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025. While strong real wage growth supported private consumption, there was a strong decline in investment due to low business confidence, low capacity utilisation and tight financing conditions as monetary policy remained restrictive to fight remaining inflationary pressures. Headline inflation ticked up to 5.6% in February 2025 due higher food and energy prices. It was still 4.2% in April and core inflation remains above 5%. Despite subdued economic activity, the labour market is robust. Unemployment declined to 4.2% in March 2025 and job vacancies are high. Hungary 1.

Higher US tariffs on EU goods will thus indirectly weigh on Hungary through reduced activity in the European Union and Germany, representing 65% and 21% of total Hungarian exports, respectively. Monetary policy is expected to continue easing at a moderate pace and the fiscal stance to weaken in 2026 Given persistent services inflation and exchange rate weakening, the central bank has kept its policy rate at 6.5% since September 2024. Looking ahead, it is expected to implement gradual and small policy rate cuts to ensure that inflation reverts back to the 3% target. The policy rate is projected to settle around 5.5% by the end of 2026. The headline fiscal deficit is expected to narrow from 4.9% of GDP in 2024 to 4.2% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026, which is still higher than before the pandemic. Abstracting from business cycle developments and interest payments, the fiscal stance is projected to be neutral in 2025 and to weaken in 2026, after two years of significant fiscal consolidation. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Hungary Current prices HUF billion GDP at market prices 55 560.5 4.3 -0.8 0.5 0.9 2.4 Private consumption 26 761.3 6.9 -1.0 5.1 5.4 3.9 Government consumption 11 552.0 3.2 3.3 -4.6 0.6 0.9 Gross fixed capital formation 15 144.2 0.7 -7.7 -11.1 -3.0 5.4 Final domestic demand 53 457.5 4.2 -2.1 -1.4 2.3 3.6 Stockbuilding¹ 2 041.0 0.2 -3.6 1.2 -0.2 0.0 Total domestic demand 55 498.4 4.2 -5.1 -0.1 2.2 3.6 Exports of goods and services 44 126.5 10.7 1.7 -3.0 -0.4 2.4 Imports of goods and services 44 064.5 10.7 -3.4 -4.0 1.2 4.1 Net exports¹ 62.0 0.0 4.8 0.6 -1.2 -1.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 14.2 15.2 7.3 6.5 4.0 Consumer price index _ 14.6 17.1 3.7 4.9 3.6 Core inflation index² _ 10.2 13.8 5.7 5.2 3.6 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.6 4.1 4.5 4.3 3.9 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 11.8 14.4 15.5 12.8 12.2 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -6.2 -6.7 -4.9 -4.2 -4.0 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 77.5 81.9 82.2 81.7 82.1 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 73.9 73.0 73.5 73.5 74.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -8.6 0.3 2.2 1.6 0.5 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) 2.

Private consumption will be supported by strong real wage growth, especially in 2025, and the household saving rate returning to its long-run level after a significant increase since the pandemic. Inflation is projected to be slightly above 3% by the end of 2026. Investment is expected to rebound progressively but will be hampered by low business confidence, low capacity utilisation, and significant trade policy uncertainty. Exports are projected to pick up but will remain closely connected to external demand from Hungary’s main trading partners, especially Germany. Economic activity in these countries is a key risk to the outlook. The availability of new manufacturing capacity, especially in the automotive sector, may provide a further boost to Hungarian exports over 2025-26, but industrial capacity utilisation is currently low and the potential of the new factories will be fully exploited only if external demand picks up significantly. Structural reforms would improve fiscal sustainability and long-term growth Reforming public pensions would limit the increase in ageing-related spending, which is projected to exceed 5 percentage points of GDP by 2070 under current legislation. Beyond possible options to tighten eligibility conditions and adjust benefit levels, financing future pensions will require additional fiscal space, which calls for consolidation. As a share of GDP, investment remains higher than the EU average but has significantly weakened in recent years. Better financing conditions, reduced trade policy uncertainty, and fully implementing recent reforms to promote public integrity and bolster investor confidence will be key to reverse this trend. Improving the insolvency framework would also facilitate the reallocation of capital across firms and the financing of productive investments. Improved regulations in the energy, transport, professional services and telecommunication sectors would strengthen competition and support the entry of new firms and investments in these sectors.  173 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Iceland GDP growth is set to recover to 1.4% in 2025 and 2.8% in 2026, driven by household consumption and the rebound of exports. Business investment will be strong in 2025 but weaken in 2026 as several projects will end. Unemployment will edge up, but the labour market remains tight. Major risks include a violent volcanic eruption and further tariff escalation affecting Iceland’s main export goods. In May, the central bank cut the policy rate to 7.5%, the fifth cut since monetary easing started in October 2024. Inflation has fallen to around 4% and is expected to reach the target by the second half of 2026. The new government has committed to a tight fiscal stance over the next two years, which will help underpin disinflation and build up fiscal space. Reforming the fiscal framework and business regulation will help increase stability and sustainability of the public finances and foster productivity, investment and growth. Economic growth has likely bottomed out Economic growth has slowed against the backdrop of tight monetary policy but seems to have passed its low point. Household consumption is expanding gradually, driven by growing real wages following the 2024 agreements and rising consumer confidence. The wage agreements of 2024 imply wage increases of over 6% per year including wage drift. Business investment has begun to recover from the downturn in the second half of 2024 as financial conditions eased. Despite slowing population growth, investment in housing remains substantial, supported by rising incomes. Exports have rebounded, particularly in the fisheries sector, which benefits from increased catch quotas. The unemployment rate has risen slightly from around 3.5% at the end of 2024. Volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula has had minimal impact over the past six months. Various inflation measures have declined sharply, but annual headline inflation, at 4.2% in April, is still well above the 2.5% target. Iceland 1. Year-on-year growth rates.

Icelandic goods are subject to a general 10% US import tariff. The additional increase in US tariffs on aluminium imports from 10% to 25% in March has had little effect so far, as Iceland does not export aluminium to the United States. Monetary policy is easing, while fiscal policy remains contractionary The central bank began easing monetary policy in early autumn 2024 and has cut the key interest rate to 7.5% by May 2025. It is projected to be lowered further throughout 2025 and more gradually thereafter, to around 5% by end-2026. The trade-weighted exchange rate has appreciated since early 2025, largely due to a weaker USD. Fiscal policy, as indicated by the underlying primary balance, will be tightened further by approximately 1.4% of GDP in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026. These measures will help alleviate inflationary pressures and build fiscal space. Gross public debt will decline further as the government-owned Housing Financing Fund is wound down. The economy is set to recover gradually The economy is projected to grow by 1.4% in 2025 and 2.8% in 2026. Private consumption will expand, driven by real wage increases. Residential investment will remain robust, supported by improving financial conditions and sustained housing demand. Business investment is projected to grow as confidence rises and financial conditions continue to ease. Export growth will be broad-based but moderate as foreign tourism will expand modestly, while aluminium production remains largely unaffected by higher tariffs with smelters operating at full capacity.

However, it could exceed expectations if import prices, especially for food and oil, begin to rise again. Escalating trade tensions could strangle goods exports and dent tourism if disposable incomes decline in the countries raising tariffs. Volcanic activity on the Reykjanes peninsula and near the capital area could cause further infrastructure damage and require additional public relief spending. Reforming the fiscal framework would strengthen public finances Replacing the current budget balance rule with a structural spending rule could mitigate pro-cyclical fiscal policy, enhancing the stability and sustainability of public finances. The introduction of resource taxes, including the planned reform of fishing fees and the implementation of a new visitor tax, will support the sustainable management of natural resources. Eliminating exemptions in the value-added tax, particularly by reinstating the standard VAT rate on tourism services, will reduce distortions within the tax system. Lowering barriers to market entry will encourage investment. Easing the licensing and permit system for various professions and accelerating further the recognition of foreign diplomas will help to boost productivity and alleviate labour shortages. 176  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 India Real GDP is projected to grow by 6.3% in fiscal year 2025-26 and 6.4% in 2026-27. Private consumption will gradually strengthen, driven by rising real incomes that are helped by moderate inflation, recent tax cuts and a strengthening of the labour market. Investment will be supported by declining interest rates and substantial public capital spending, but higher US tariffs will weigh on exports. Inflation will remain contained at around 4% as economic activity grows around trend. A less benign monsoon season or higher global commodity prices could drive up food prices and inflation. The Union Budget for the fiscal year 2025–26 foresees a moderate fiscal consolidation, aiming to reduce the headline budget deficit from 4.8% of GDP in fiscal year 2024-25 to 4.4% in 2025-26. With inflation firmly within the target range, monetary policy is gradually expected to become more accommodative. Better targeting of energy and fertiliser subsidies, and an overhaul of tax expenditures, could enhance spending efficiency and free resources for other policy priorities. Improving logistics efficiency, upgrading digital infrastructure, and enhancing policy predictability, particularly in tax administration, could bolster private investment. Domestic demand supports activity Real GDP expanded by 6.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of FY2024-25, supported by robust domestic demand and strong investment. High-frequency indicators suggest that economic activity remained solid in the fourth quarter. Industrial production rose by 3.7% year-on-year in the first four months of 2025, with the manufacturing sector regaining strength. India’s current account deficit widened in the first three quarters of FY2024-25, due to a persistent merchandise trade deficit that was only partially offset by strong services exports. More recent data suggest a slight improvement in the trade balance. The labour market was resilient in 2024 with the labour force participation rate increasing to 45.1% and employment continuing to rise. Survey data from early 2025 show optimism in the labour market, especially in sectors such as information technology, retail, and finance. Monetary conditions remain restrictive, despite policy rate cuts in February and April. Headline inflation eased to 3.2% in April 2025 and is now within the central bank’s target range of 4% ± 2%, largely due to a substantial moderation in food inflation, which accounts for nearly half of the CPI basket, and declining energy prices. Easing food prices reflect a strong autumn harvest, and government interventions, such as export restrictions. As a major oil importer, India has benefited from lower global crude oil prices in recent months, which reduced domestic fuel costs and helped contain input costs in energy-intensive sectors such as transport, manufacturing, and agriculture. While core inflation remains slightly above 4%, wage growth remains moderate. High merchandise export exposure to the United States, which is India’s largest export market, increases the vulnerability of private investment to shifts in trade policy. Tariff increases and broader trade tensions may damp investor sentiment, particularly in export-oriented sectors such as chemicals, textiles, and electronics. However, the overall GDP effects will be limited by the moderate share of exports in GDP, with merchandise exports towards the United States accounting for only 2.1% of GDP.  177 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 India 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/1e0bsf Monetary policy is expected to ease amid rising public investment The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its current easing cycle in February 2025, followed by a second policy rate cut in April. Despite the cumulative 50 basis point reduction, which lowered the policy rate from 6.5% to 6.0%, financial conditions remain tight. Monetary policy is expected to ease further over FY2025– 26 as headline inflation remains within the target range over 2025 due to the moderation of food and energy prices, which make up a large share of the consumer price index. Low global commodity prices and a broadly balanced output gap are helping to contain demand-side pressures. In addition, the credibility of the RBI’s inflation-targeting framework continues to anchor inflation expectations. With headline inflation expected to remain within the target range in the following years and inflation expectations projected to remain anchored, there is scope for the central bank to reduce the policy rate towards a more neutral level. A further 25-basis point cut is expected by the end of 2025. The central government is expected to pursue fiscal consolidation, bringing the budget deficit from 4.8% of GDP in FY 2024-25 to 4.4% in FY 2025-26, with local governments projected to adopt a similar stance. The adjustment relies primarily on higher revenues. Although the recently approved Union Budget includes income tax cuts for middle-income households, overall tax revenues are projected to increase by 0.3% of GDP, partly reflecting the positive impact of tax code simplification and digitalisation on compliance. On the expenditure side, total spending is set to decline by 0.1% of GDP, largely reflecting reduced subsidies. Public capital expenditure and defence spending are maintained at their current levels as a share of GDP. Private demand will drive growth amid emerging external headwinds Real GDP is projected to grow by 6.3% in FY2025-26 and 6.4% in FY2026-27. Private consumption is supported by rising real incomes and lower personal income taxes. Investment will remain strong, bolstered by easing financial conditions. However, export growth is expected to slow due to weaker global demand, the impact of higher tariffs and heightened trade policy uncertainty. Headline inflation is projected to average 4.1% in FY2025-26 and 4.0% in FY2026-27. Inflation expectations remain well anchored, and wage pressures are expected to remain contained with the economy projected to grow around potential, suggesting limited demand-driven inflation pressures.  179 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The balance of risks is tilted to the downside. The summer monsoon is projected to be normal. A less benign monsoon would reduce agricultural output and rural incomes, push up food prices, and weigh on GDP. The agricultural sector accounts for over 15% of GDP and employs a large share of the population. Additionally, the risk of increased trade tensions, including the imposition of higher US tariffs on Indian exports, could dampen external demand and harm export-oriented sectors such as textiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Trade tensions may also discourage private investment in tradable sectors. Stronger-than-expected remittances and investment inflows, coupled with robust infrastructure implementation, could lift growth above current projections. Fiscal prudence and reforms are important to sustain growth Phasing out tax expenditures, rationalising subsidies, and expanding tax bases would improve the quality and sustainability of public finances, creating room for expanding social protection, higher public investment, and active labour market policies. Emphasis should be placed on policies that raise labour force participation, especially among women. Although female employment has increased markedly, from 17.5% in FY2017–18 to 31.7% in FY2023–24, strengthening women’s access to formal jobs will require coordinated reforms in childcare availability, safe and affordable transportation, skill-building, and enforcement of workplace protections. India has scope to accelerate trade liberalisation, simplify customs procedures, and reduce tariffs. Further reforms are needed to improve the efficiency of logistics networks, upgrade digital infrastructure, and reduce regulatory uncertainty, especially in tax administration. Enhancing the availability and accessibility of long-term finance, including through deepening capital markets and improving credit access for SMEs, would further strengthen the investment climate. 180  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Indonesia Real GDP is projected to grow by 4.7% in 2025 and 4.8% in 2026. Low inflation and easing financial conditions will spur private consumption and investment. However, uncertainty about domestic fiscal policy will temper these gains, while export growth is expected to slow amid global trade tensions. Inflation is projected to pick up to 2.3% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, as the recent depreciation of the currency gradually feeds into domestic prices. The current account deficit is expected to widen modestly, but a further decline in commodity prices could exacerbate this by driving down export revenues. Monetary policy is expected to continue to ease over 2025 and 2026, as inflationary pressures remain contained amid soft growth. Fiscal policy is projected to be broadly neutral in 2025, as increased spending on a free meals programme and additional public investment through the new sovereign wealth fund (“Danantara”) will be financed by spending cuts elsewhere. Reducing regulatory barriers to foreign investment and raising the efficiency of public spending through improved targeting of social benefits to vulnerable households are key medium-term policy priorities. Reducing informality would help improve social protection and raise tax revenues. The economy is going through a soft patch Annual seasonally unadjusted real GDP growth slowed to 4.9% in the first quarter of 2025, amid soft investment, stable household consumption and a positive contribution from net exports. While the unemployment rate declined to 4.8% in the first quarter of 2025, among the lowest values in two decades, the economy appears to have slowed, as consumer and business sentiment deteriorated and prices of key export commodities declined. Low inflation is supporting real household incomes, but high borrowing costs continue to weigh on investment. Inflation has come down from around 6% in the second half of 2022 to 2% in April 2025, on the back of monetary policy tightening, the normalisation of food and commodity prices and a temporary electricity price discount in January and February of 2025. The phase-out of the price discount and the depreciation of the currency – around 4% relative to the US dollar since the beginning of the year – will put upward pressure on prices in the near term, but core inflation remains close to the mid-point of the central bank’s target band of 1.5-3.5% and inflation expectations are stable. Exposure to higher US import tariffs is relatively limited, with goods exports to the United States amounting to less than 2% of GDP.  181 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Indonesia 1 1.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/t3cdvl Macroeconomic policies are becoming less restrictive Monetary policy is expected to ease over 2025-26. The central bank initiated the ongoing easing cycle in August 2024, bringing the policy rate from 6.25% to 5.5% in May, but financial conditions remain restrictive. With stable inflation expectations and domestic demand growth projected to be below trend, there is room for the central bank to further reduce the policy rate towards a more neutral level of around 5%. Pursuing a data-dependent approach that balances support to economic growth and close monitoring of price pressures from the recent currency depreciation is key to durably maintain inflation within the central bank’s target band. The government budget deficit is expected to increase from 2.3% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025. The expansion of a free meals programme for schoolchildren and pregnant women and the creation of a new sovereign wealth fund, as well as foregone revenue from a temporary electricity price discount in early 2025 will put upward pressure of around 1.6% of GDP on the budget deficit. This will be mitigated by across-the-board spending cuts amounting to around 1.3% of GDP, which will maintain the budget deficit below the statutory limit of 3% of GDP. Despite the rising budget deficit, the fiscal policy stance will be neutral in 2025, as only part of the funds transferred to the new sovereign wealth fund will translate into new public investment outlays in 2025. Accelerating disbursements from the new sovereign wealth fund in the near term while ensuring transparency and accountability in its management would support growth in 2025, which appears appropriate amid rising uncertainty about the growth outlook. Gradually raising government revenue from 2026 would put public debt – which is currently around 40% of GDP – on a declining path. Growth is expected to slow in the near term Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 4.7% in 2025 before picking up slightly to 4.8% in 2026. The recent weakening of business and consumer sentiment amid fiscal policy uncertainty and high borrowing costs will weigh on private consumption and investment in the first half of 2025. As financial conditions gradually ease, inflation remains comfortably within the central bank’s target band, and public investment outlays  183 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 from the new sovereign wealth fund gather momentum, domestic demand is expected to gradually increase over the second half of 2025 and 2026. The recent escalation of global trade tensions and the decline in commodity prices are expected to weigh on external demand and export revenues. Inflation is expected to gradually rise to the mid-point of the central bank’s target range, as the effects of the temporary electricity price discount at the beginning of 2025 fade, and the recent depreciation of the currency gradually feeds into domestic prices. Risks are tilted to the downside. Persistent capital outflows driven by global and domestic policy uncertainty could place renewed pressure on the currency, potentially leading to a temporary widening of the current account deficit and fuelling inflation through higher import costs. Additionally, a larger-than-expected slowdown in China – Indonesia’s largest export market – would further weigh on export performance, particularly in commodity sectors. On the upside, swift and effective deployment of the newly established sovereign wealth fund could catalyse private investment by crowding in capital and accelerate the implementation of high-impact infrastructure and industrial projects. Structural reforms are needed to boost growth Recent reforms have reduced barriers to foreign investment, but significant barriers to foreign equity ownership remain, especially in the telecommunications and transportation sectors. Moreover, the investment climate is affected by overlapping regulations, uneven policy implementation, and limited coordination among government agencies. Further reforms in this area will become increasingly relevant in the context of global trade policy uncertainty and the potential reconfiguration of supply chains. Addressing infant malnutrition through the free meals programme will strengthen public health, but improved targeting to vulnerable households would ensure that funds are spent more efficiently. Reforms to reduce informality would help broaden the tax base and create fiscal space for the expansion of public investment, including transport infrastructure and clean energy, as well as health and education spending. Shifting the funding of maternity leave from employers to social insurance, in particular for smaller firms and self-employed women, would help raise female labour force participation. 184  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Ireland GDP growth is projected to be 3.7% in 2025, before moderating to 2.3% in 2026, as trade fragmentation weighs on export-oriented sectors. On the domestic side, heightened uncertainty will encourage households to save more, despite sustained nominal wage growth underpinned by a tight labour market. Modified domestic demand, which controls for the major distortions arising from the activity of multinationals, is projected to expand by 2.2% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026, below its long-term average of 2.7%. As the United States is Ireland’s biggest export market and multinationals play a large role in Irish exports and tax revenues, higher tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers would lower growth and exacerbate medium-term fiscal challenges. Prioritising productivity-enhancing reforms, spending efficiency, and stricter domestic fiscal controls will be key. Planned infrastructure investment should be implemented, albeit properly sequenced to avoid adding to inflation. The strong labour market shores up the domestic economy According to preliminary estimates, GDP grew strongly by 3.2% in the first quarter of 2025, mainly reflecting strong exports of pharmaceuticals despite considerable global uncertainty. Amidst persistent population growth, the labour market was robust in early 2025, with strong job creation and low unemployment. After easing considerably in late 2024, headline inflation bounced back to 2.0% in April, driven mostly by food prices, while stronger services price growth pushed core inflation up to 2.4%. Consumer spending rebounded by end-2024, driven by sustained wage growth underpinned by labour shortages. Buoyant VAT revenues indicate ongoing strength in private consumption in early 2025. Going forward, tariff-related uncertainties will weigh on consumer confidence. Ireland 1. Deflated by the harmonised index of consumer prices.

An extension of the tariff to currently exempt pharmaceuticals, or a tightening of non-tariff barriers on services trade, could weigh heavily on growth. Exports of pharmaceuticals – largely from US-owned multinationals – to the United States, Ireland’s largest single export market, surged to EUR 44 billion in 2024, out of total goods exports of EUR 73 billion. Multinational\u0002dominated trade with the United States in intellectual property products, computer, and business services accounts for about 25% of Ireland’s services trade. Public spending pressures are mounting Looming risks warrant greater fiscal prudence. Underlying tax revenue growth remained strong in early 2025. As Budget 2025 measures – worth 2.0% of 2024 GDP; 3.6% of GNI* – are being rolled out, public spending is surging. In addition to higher public investment and a set of loosely targeted new cost-of-living initiatives, the package includes permanent current spending increases and tax measures to offset income threshold effects. Higher spending and weaker tax revenues due to second-round effects from the 10% tariff on US goods imports from the European Union, and the further extension of reduced VAT rates on electricity and gas to end-October 2025, will lower the budget surplus to 1.3% of GDP (2.2% of GNI*) in 2025. The fiscal stance is slightly expansionary in the projection period, even assuming no income-support measures in 2026. Gross public debt is projected to fall close to 60% of GNI* (36% of GDP) by 2026. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Ireland Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 448.1 8.7 -5.6 1.2 3.7 2.3 Private consumption 105.4 10.9 4.3 2.3 2.2 1.9 Government consumption 52.6 4.1 5.5 4.2 3.0 2.4 Gross fixed capital formation 98.8 4.2 2.8 -25.8 19.7 3.1 Final domestic demand 256.8 7.3 3.9 -7.1 7.7 2.4 Stockbuilding¹ 5.1 0.8 1.3 -3.1 -1.8 0.0 Total domestic demand 261.9 7.9 5.7 -12.0 3.2 2.5 Exports of goods and services 597.0 13.6 -6.0 11.9 3.9 3.2 Imports of goods and services 410.8 16.4 1.3 6.5 4.1 3.1 Net exports¹ 186.2 3.1 -9.5 9.4 1.5 1.4 Memorandum items _ 9.1 2.7 2.6 2.2 2.1 _ 6.9 4.0 2.8 2.6 2.8 _ 8.1 5.2 1.3 2.1 2.0 _ 4.6 4.4 2.3 2.3 2.1 _ 4.4 4.3 4.2 4.4 4.6 _ 10.5 9.3 9.8 11.1 11.2 _ 1.7 1.5 4.4 1.3 0.9 _ 45.4 46.2 41.3 38.2 36.0 _ 43.2 43.2 41.1 38.0 35.8 _ 8.8 8.1 17.2 14.1 13.7 Percentage changes, volume (2022 prices) Modified final domestic demand², volume GDP deflator Harmonised index of core inflation³ Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) Current account balance (% of GDP) 2.

Hence, modified domestic demand is projected to expand by just over 2% annually through 2026, though GDP growth is projected at 3.7% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026. Higher input costs and services prices will push headline inflation up to 2.1% in 2025, despite milder energy price pressures, while core inflation will reach 2.3%, before both ease slightly in 2026. Given the key role of a few large foreign\u0002owned multinationals in export-oriented sectors, like pharmaceuticals or advanced computer and business services, higher general or industry-specific tariffs or non-tariff barriers could lower growth and adversely impact fiscal balances. On the upside, manufacturing multinationals’ significant sunk investments in both labour and capital equipment may help mitigate the impact of tariffs on growth. Amid significant skills shortages, the employment correction to the shock might be softened by firms’ reluctance to shed staff. Tackling infrastructure bottlenecks remains a priority Higher investment in housing, transport and energy infrastructure is essential to maintain foreign investor confidence and preserve living standards. While tariffs could lower corporate and personal income tax revenues, excess corporate tax receipts should continue to be allocated to the long-term savings funds, which are intended to address ageing-related costs and support medium-term productivity-enhancing investment. Additionally, greater emphasis should be placed on improving spending efficiency – supported by comprehensive spending reviews, stricter domestic fiscal guard-rails, and better-targeted income support where needed. Boosting work incentives in the tax and benefit system, alongside improving the supply of quality vocational pathways for low-skilled workers, could help alleviate labour and skills shortages. Easing SMEs’ access to R&D funding and to tailored lifelong learning programmes, via the National Training Fund, could help foster domestic investment in digitalisation and innovation, and result in more even productivity gains.  187 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Israel Economic activity is on a path to expand by 3.3% in 2025 and by 4.9% in 2026. The ceasefire in Lebanon at the end of 2024 brought a significant improvement in the economic environment spurring exports and private consumption. With a tight labour market and lingering supply constraints, inflation is anticipated to remain high at 3.2% in 2025 before moderating to 2.9% in 2026. Risks are substantial, hinging on regional geopolitical developments. Implementing the fiscal consolidation planned for 2025-2026 is important to secure fiscal sustainability while creating buffers. Monetary policy must remain tight to ensure that inflation durably falls back within the 1-3% target range. Strong population growth necessitates investment in physical and education infrastructure accompanied by reforms to remove regulatory barriers and restructure the education system so that it can deliver high-quality teaching for all. The recovery is accelerating The economic recovery has gathered strength since the ceasefire in Lebanon at the end of 2024, with GDP expanding at an annualised rate of 3.4% in the first quarter of 2025. By removing most of the threat of rocket fire over the north and centre of the country, the ceasefire strongly improved the economic environment with long-term bond yields consequently falling by more than half a percentage point since October 2024. Foreign airlines returned to the Tel Aviv airport, facilitating international business and a recovery of high-tech investment. The improvement in living conditions enabled consumption to remain strong. Despite the one-percentage point VAT rise at the start of 2025, credit card purchases by March 2025 overtook their level in December 2024, which had been boosted by advance buying ahead of the VAT increase.

Tariffs on the 28% of Israeli merchandise exports that ship to the United States average below 7%. Services, which make up much of Israel’s exports to the United States, remain outside the scope of the new US tariffs. The effective exchange rate appreciation since October 2024 is also reducing import price inflation. Imports of goods are also facilitated by the “What’s good for Europe is good for Israel” reform, whereby goods meeting EU standards across a wide range of categories are deemed compliant with Israeli standards. Macroeconomic policy is adequately tight The fiscal stance is set to tighten in 2025 and 2026. After rising from 4.2% of GDP in 2022 to 8.0% in 2024, military expenditure will fall, albeit to a higher level than before October 2023. Simultaneously, government receipts are poised to rise in 2025-2026 following the VAT rate increase, the new tax on undistributed profits of some holding companies, the increase in national insurance contributions, the freeze of personal income tax brackets and other revenue-generating measures. Despite this fiscal tightening and the currency appreciation, monetary policy is expected to remain restrictive as, at 3.6% in April 2025, inflation lies above the 1-3% target range, while the labour market remains very tight with 2.7% unemployment in April 2025. Furthermore, persistent labour shortages in construction constrain supply. The private sector is set to drive growth Activity is set to expand by 3.3% in 2025 and 4.9% in 2026 under the impetus of private consumption and exports.

Risks are large but balanced. On the upside, a peaceful settlement of ongoing conflicts would reduce sovereign risk. New diplomatic agreements with countries in the region would durably boost trade. On the downside, broader regional conflict could result in economic contraction and a large widening of fiscal deficits. Deepening unrest in relation with judicial reform plans could also derail high-tech dynamism, especially if it involved significant high-skilled labour emigration. Forward-looking economic management is paramount Macroeconomic policy needs to remain prudent to keep the economy on track for a balanced recovery. Besides maintaining the revenue-raising instruments already deployed, the government should lower transfers and subsidies that can discourage labour market participation. Monetary policy needs to remain restrictive until inflation is set to come durably into the target range. Looking ahead, strong demographic growth calls for substantial investment in physical capital, to address infrastructure gaps, and in education, to maintain the strong skills base that the high-tech sector and the rest of the economy require to reap the dividends of AI and digitisation. In addition, infrastructure and education both require structural reforms to remove unnecessary regulatory obstacles to entry, competition and investment and ensure that the education system works well for pupils across population groups. 190  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Italy GDP growth is expected to slow slightly to 0.6% in 2025 and pick up to 0.7% in 2026. Global trade policy disruptions are expected to drag on growth. Higher real wages are set to support consumer demand. Investment will be boosted by accelerated implementation of National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) projects. Export volumes are poised to stagnate in 2025 due to more restrictive trade policy settings and sluggish demand in key European markets. Downside risks dominate, including the uncertain response of investors and employers to global policy developments. Faster implementation of NRRP projects or stronger export demand from other European countries would bolster growth. Continuing fiscal consolidation is projected in 2025 and 2026, as the government remains committed to reducing the fiscal deficit and putting the public finances on a sustainable medium-term path. Progress implementing the NRRP should encourage greater private investment and employment in the medium term. Sustaining living standards in the longer term will require improving opportunities for graduating youth and older workers to update their skills to meet the needs of the labour market. Weaker industrial production has weighed on GDP growth GDP expanded by 0.7% in 2024, with weak growth in the second half of the year. Export volumes fell. Industrial production was 1.8% lower in March 2025 than a year earlier and has fallen for over two years. The weakness is broadly-based, with motor vehicles and parts production especially weak. Investment has been dragged by lower housing construction with the winding-down of the generous Superbonus building tax credit from early 2024. Private consumption was buoyed by support to disposable incomes from rising employment and wages and moderate underlying inflation. The unemployment rate was 6% in March 2025, near its lowest rate since prior to the global financial crisis. Italy is exposed to more restrictive US trade policy through higher tariffs on EU goods. Over 10% of Italy’s total goods exports in 2023 went to the United States. Moreover, the indirect effects may be significant, for example through global motor vehicle production chains or weaker demand globally. Italy is also exposed to growing competition from Chinese industrial products. Volatility in international energy prices has been transmitted into consumer prices. Higher gas prices in early 2025 contributed to headline inflation rising to 2.0% in the year to April 2025. In response, the government introduced a new support programme targeting lower income households. The fall in gas and petroleum prices in March and April 2025 is passing into producer and consumer prices.  191 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Italy 1 Source: Istat; and OECD Economic Outlook 117 database.

StatLink 2https://stat.link/helnfq Fiscal consolidation continues alongside implementation of the NRRP The fiscal deficit fell to 3.4% of GDP in 2024, 0.4 percentage points lower than the government had budgeted. A modest reduction is projected for 2025 and further consolidation in 2026, in line with the medium-term structural fiscal plan submitted to the European Commission. These are projected to reduce the headline budget deficit by 0.6% of GDP. The ramp-down in spending on the building tax credit is supporting consolidation, alongside positive revenue developments and some savings in ministries’ spending. The government expects these to be sufficient to offset planned income tax cuts and tax bracket consolidation, as well as planned increases in spending, including on health care and investment. The government also plans small increases in defence and national security spending, and to accelerate public investment spending, although this will mainly be in 2026. The improvement in the budget balance may be more modest than the government’s projections given the weakening growth outlook and increased pressures for defence and other spending. Italy has continued to make progress on implementing the reforms in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and spending rates have increased. Lower euro area interest rates are passing into lending and deposit rates. Household borrowing demand started rising in early 2025, although businesses continued to reduce their borrowing. Long-term government bond yields were broadly stable from mid-2024 to May 2025, while spreads relative to equivalent German government bond yields declined to about 105 basis points in mid-May 2025, after averaging around 125 basis points over the previous six months. Still, the government expects the interest cost of public debt to rise. Global trade policy developments will drag on the recovery in GDP growth Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 0.6% in 2025 and pick-up slightly to 0.7% in 2026. New global trade restrictions are expected to result in export volumes contracting slightly in 2026 – the first contraction since the global financial crisis (excluding the pandemic). Exports are expected to resume growing in 2026 as other European countries increase their investment and defence spending. Consumer demand is expected to remain resilient, despite the increased economic uncertainty, as real wages are supported by  193 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 firm employment and wage growth and moderate inflation. Investment is set to grow with the accelerating disbursement of NextGenerationEU-funded projects, while residential construction spending returns to longer-term average levels with the withdrawal of the Superbonus tax credits. Other business investment is poised to remain weak, despite lower financing costs, due to uncertainty over the global economic and policy environment. Headline inflation is set to ease as the increase in energy and fresh food prices fades, while underlying inflation will rise moderately with ongoing wage growth. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside due to the uncertainty created by global trade policy developments. New or retaliatory trade restrictions or more prolonged weakness in demand in the euro area may lead to a deeper contraction in exports than expected. Uncertainty over policy may lead to firms cutting investment and recruitment plans by more than expected and households cutting their expenditure to build precautionary savings. On the upside, more of the public investment projects funded through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) could be implemented than expected over 2025 and 2026. Raising the economy’s potential while proceeding with fiscal consolidation will support investment Achieving the planned fiscal consolidation will be necessary to ensure public debt is on a prudent path and to contain interest expenses. The high share of spending on pensions and rising spending pressures from ageing, climate and defence needs in the medium term requires significant reforms. Raising property taxes and addressing tax evasion, and containing pension spending despite demographic pressures, can create room for public investment. Ensuring effective and timely disbursement of NextGenerationEU-funded projects will boost near-term demand and improve the investment climate into the longer-term. Simplifying the authorisation procedures for renewable energy and associated electricity grid investments would reduce the dependence on natural gas, lower energy costs and accelerate electrification. Bolstering the labour force will be central for private investment prospects. Improving school leavers’ readiness for the workforce, such as by boosting apprenticeships and advanced technical education, would help support the size and skills of the workforce, and improve the attractiveness of staying in Italy for young adults. Women’s participation would be raised by continuing to expand public support for care for children and other dependents. Expanding access to reskilling opportunities for adults to extend their working lives will also help address demographic challenges and the labour force’s needs. 194  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Japan Real GDP growth is projected at 0.7% in 2025, despite significant headwinds, before reverting towards potential in 2026, at 0.4%. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. Private consumption is set to increase as robust wage growth boosts households’ disposable income. Expanding profits and government subsidies, especially for green and digital investment, will support business investment, despite higher uncertainty. External demand will exert a drag on growth, reflecting the higher US tariffs. A surge in food prices will slightly raise headline consumer price inflation in 2025, before it eases towards the 2% target in 2026. Inflation above target over the past three years and robust wage growth warrant continued gradual policy interest rate increases, but high uncertainty calls for close monitoring and a data-driven pace. The primary fiscal balance is projected to improve absent additional supplementary budgets, which should be limited to large shocks. To increase fiscal buffers to address shocks and ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, a medium-term fiscal consolidation path is needed amid rising debt servicing costs. Structural reforms to boost productivity, including labour-saving and labour-augmenting investment, and employment are key to address demographic headwinds and raise potential growth. Robust profits and wage growth are supporting domestic demand While GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2025, domestic demand grew robustly. Business investment increased, supported by high corporate profits, and the order backlog of machinery rose to record highs. The Bank of Japan’s March Tankan Survey, which did not fully factor in the impact of US tariffs, pointed to robust future investment plans. Consumption remained flat in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting declining consumer confidence amidst high inflation, despite rising nominal wages and strong labour market performance. Annual headline consumer price inflation was 3.6% in April, due to sticky food inflation, despite the resumption of electricity and city gas subsidies between January and March. The outcome of the ongoing annual wage negotiations for FY2025, with a 3.8% base pay increase as of 2 May, is stronger than last year. Japan 1 1. As of 2 May. The horizontal axis shows fiscal years.

Contributions to changes in real GDP, actual amount in the first column. 196  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 The United States, Japan’s main export destination at 20% of total goods exports in 2024, has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium products, and automobiles and auto parts, as well as an additional flat tariff of 10% as of mid-April 2025. The impact on the Japanese economy will be direct, as for example automobile exports to the United Stares are high at 6% of total exports, and indirect through higher uncertainty and lower global growth. The projections assume no trade policy retaliation by Japan. Imports and inventories grew strongly in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting precautionary behaviour by firms in the face of higher trade uncertainty. Inbound tourism has expanded robustly, driven primarily by tourists from China. Macroeconomic support is projected to gradually decrease In January, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised the policy interest rate from around 0.25% to around 0.5%, the highest level in 17 years. The BoJ’s reduction of its monthly purchases of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) by around JPY 400 billion each quarter, targeting about JPY 3 trillion by the first quarter of 2026 and roughly a 7-8% reduction in JGB holdings by March 2026, has been proceeding smoothly. Corporate inflation expectations have risen moderately to 2.5%, 2.4%, and 2.3% at the one-, three-, and five-year horizons, respectively, according to the Tankan Survey. Given inflation and wage developments, monetary accommodation should continue to be withdrawn gradually, with the policy rate projected to reach 1¼ per cent during the latter half of 2026. High uncertainty calls for close monitoring and a data-driven pace to monetary policy normalisation. The underlying primary deficit is projected to decrease from 1.5% of GDP in 2024 to 0.6% in 2026, assuming no supplementary budgets in FY2025 and FY2026, helped by fiscal consolidation in both years. OECD projections assume an increase in public investment to mitigate the impact of future disasters by 0.2% of GDP in FY2026, and additional expenditures on high school tuition assistance by 0.1% of GDP and defence spending by 0.2% of GDP in FY2025-2026. On the other hand, the corporate tax rate will be increased by 4 percentage points in April 2026 to partly finance increased defence spending. Subsidies for electricity and city gas bills will be resumed between July and September 2025. Given lower oil prices, the projections assume that the gasoline price subsidy will be phased out at the end of 2025. The gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 227% in 2023 to 213% in 2026, as nominal growth surpasses debt servicing costs. Domestic demand will drive growth but faces significant risks Real GDP is projected to grow by 0.7% and 0.4% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, driven by domestic demand. Strong wage growth will support private consumption. Despite headwinds from uncertainty, business investment is projected to remain robust in 2025, reflecting high corporate profits, a large order backlog in machinery and government subsidies. Higher trade restrictions, weaker global demand and elevated uncertainty about trading partner trade policies will weigh on exports, moderating growth. Headline consumer price inflation is projected to edge up to 2.8% in 2025, before converging to the 2% target in 2026 as food inflation slows. Risks are tilted to the downside. Weaker-than-expected external demand and abrupt changes in financial markets would lower growth. A large and rapid appreciation of the yen could reduce corporate profits and wage increases, leading to lower-than-projected private consumption and investment. Abrupt changes in bond and equity prices could destabilise financial markets and hurt the balance sheets of private financial institutions, the government, and the public pension funds. Interest rates on long-dated Japanese government bonds have already surged to record highs in May. A loss of confidence in Japan’s fiscal sustainability and an increase in the sovereign risk premium could also adversely affect the financial sector and the real economy. The main upside risk is higher-than-projected exports due to a rapid reconstruction  197 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 of international supply chains, the establishment of new export channels or an agreement with the United States on tariffs. Rebuilding fiscal buffers and boosting potential growth are priorities A higher interest bill and expenditure pressures related to spending on health and long-term care for an ageing population will exacerbate medium-term fiscal sustainability challenges. A medium-term fiscal consolidation path needs to be spelled out and adhered to, underpinned by concrete revenue and expenditure measures. Supplementary budgets should only be used in the event of large shocks. Additional potential support against the high cost-of-living or tariffs could derail fiscal consolidation and, if implemented, should be targeted and temporary. Misallocation of capital and labour and population ageing have weighed on investment and total factor productivity growth during the past decade. Reforms to improve the innovation framework and incentives for start-ups, such as redesigning the R&D tax credit and strengthening the links between universities and SMEs, would boost productivity growth and investment in new technologies and digitalisation. Investing in labour-saving and labour-augmenting technologies, as well as re-skilling and upskilling to address changing skill needs, are also key. Higher labour mobility can also boost knowledge transfer and productivity growth. Reforms to boost the labour supply of older, female, and migrant workers should also be continued to address demographic headwinds. 198  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Korea GDP growth is projected to weaken to 1.0% in 2025 before picking up to 2.2% in 2026. Increased tariffs and uncertainty are set to hold back export growth and weaken business investment. Private consumption should pick up from late 2025 as domestic political uncertainty subsides and real wages continue to rise. Inflation will remain close to target. Increased female and elderly labour market participation will raise employment, and unemployment is set to edge down in 2026. The Bank of Korea cut the policy rate to 2.75% in February and is expected to lower it further to 2.0% in 2025 amid weak demand. The partial reversal of large revenue shortfalls in 2023 and 2024 will contribute to the planned fiscal consolidation in 2025. Any additional fiscal support should be complemented by a sustainable long-term fiscal framework. Labour market reform can boost growth, reduce elderly poverty and lessen the high opportunity cost of motherhood. Confidence is tested by an uncertain environment The martial law declaration on 3 December 2024 dealt a blow to already weak domestic demand. Consumer and business confidence have been subpar. GDP contracted in the first quarter of 2025, largely driven by temporary factors holding back business and housing investment. Confidence will be boosted by the resolution of the presidential impeachment case, but uncertainty related to tariffs and international trade pulls in the opposite direction. Employment bottomed out in late 2024, and unemployment is falling back from a recent peak. Retail sales volumes have fallen in early 2025. Housing prices and construction orders have been sliding. Recent inflation readings are largely in line with the 2% target, with headline inflation at 2.1% and core inflation at 2.4% in April. Korea 1. Quarterly averages.

The Government will pursue negotiations and is not expected to respond by raising tariffs on the United States in the near term. Customs exports flatlined in the first quarter of 2025, contrary to expectations of an increase driven by front-loading ahead of the imposition of tariffs. Monetary policy is easing while the fiscal stance remains restrictive The Bank of Korea cut the policy rate to 2.75% in February, keeping the stance slightly restrictive. Further cuts totalling 75 basis points are expected in the course of 2025 to boost domestic demand and counteract the drag on growth from increased tariffs and uncertainty. Thereafter, the policy rate is assumed to remain at 2% until the end of 2026. A supplementary spending package of 0.1% of GDP has been legislated, with spending expected to be front-loaded in the second quarter. Fiscal policy is assumed to be restrictive, with consolidation of 1.1% of GDP over 2025-26, notably due to a partial reversal of the weak corporate income tax receipts over the past two years. Tariffs and uncertainty hold back growth GDP is set to grow by 1.0% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. Household consumption will gather strength gradually, supported by rising real incomes and improving labour market conditions. Business and housing investments are set to bounce back from the second quarter of 2025. Inflation is on course to remain around the 2% target. A prolonged slowdown in key trading partners and spiralling protectionism could further strain Korea’s trade-dependent economy. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Korea Current prices KRW trillion GDP at market prices 2 221.9 2.7 1.4 2.1 1.0 2.2 Private consumption 1 046.8 4.2 1.8 1.1 1.2 2.4 Government consumption 378.3 4.0 1.3 1.8 2.1 1.8 Gross fixed capital formation 699.6 -0.2 1.4 -0.7 -1.8 2.5 Final domestic demand 2 124.7 2.7 1.6 0.7 0.4 2.3 Stockbuilding¹ 22.3 0.1 -0.2 -0.5 0.3 0.0 Total domestic demand 2 147.0 2.8 1.4 0.2 0.8 2.3 Exports of goods and services 874.1 3.9 3.6 7.1 0.3 3.5 Imports of goods and services 799.2 4.2 3.5 2.5 0.0 3.8 Net exports¹ 74.9 0.0 0.0 1.9 0.2 0.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 1.8 1.9 4.1 2.8 1.9 Consumer price index _ 5.1 3.6 2.3 2.1 2.0 Core inflation index² _ 3.6 3.4 2.2 2.0 2.0 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 2.9 2.7 2.8 2.9 2.8 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 7.4 4.8 3.5 3.5 3.2 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 0.0 -0.7 -3.0 -3.0 -2.4 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 46.2 48.9 50.7 52.8 54.2 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 1.3 1.8 5.3 5.7 5.6 Percentage changes, volume (2020 prices) 1.

Fiscal support may also be appropriate in the short term, but public debt has increased rapidly over the past few years, while reducing budget deficits according to plans has proved difficult. The agreement between the government and opposition on additional spending should therefore be followed by a bipartisan commitment to placing the public finances on a sustainable path going forward. Lowering barriers to trade and foreign direct investment, combined with growth-friendly fiscal measures such as environmental taxes, increased auctioning in the emissions trading scheme and streamlining of state support to companies could strengthen investment. Reforming the labour market to reduce duality, move decisively from seniority-based to performance-based wage setting and systematically enforce legislation against discrimination, can boost growth, lower elderly poverty and lessen the high opportunity cost of motherhood.  201 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Latvia Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. High inflation and rising geopolitical uncertainty are bearing down on the recovery of private consumption and investment. Increasing public investment will gradually strengthen domestic demand, while export demand is weakened by rising global trade barriers. Core inflation will remain high due to strong wage growth related to labour shortages. Further delays in the absorption of EU funds could adversely affect the recovery in domestic demand. Increasing revenue and reallocating spending to finance the strengthening of defence capacity are key to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. Improved capacity for infrastructure planning and policy impact evaluation would help increase spending efficiency. Listing large state-owned enterprises could help deepen capital markets and improve access to finance for firms. Reducing the labour tax wedge for low-income earners and shifting the tax burden towards other income, property and environmental taxes would help lower informality. Strengthening competition enforcement and addressing skills shortages by improving training opportunities and facilitating skilled immigration would support business dynamism, innovation and investment. Weak confidence and slow absorption of EU funds have weighed on growth GDP has stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2024. Private consumption fell due to low confidence and a surge in food price inflation, despite strong wage growth in the fourth quarter. Slow absorption of EU funds has weighed on public and private investment, despite easing financing conditions. Industrial production fell by 2% in March compared to February and was about 2½ per cent lower than a year earlier. Annual inflation rose from 3.5% in March to 4% in April due to rising food prices, and core inflation increased to 4.2%, reflecting strong wage growth and high services price inflation. The unemployment rate was 6.7% in March, and the vacancy rate was 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024, reflecting increased shortages of technicians, professionals and managers. Declining relative import prices and an increase in demand for defence equipment contributed to import volumes, which increased by 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter. Exports increased by 2.2% over the quarter, particularly driven by IT and business services. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed in the first quarter of 2025 but widened in March due to a rapid rise in import values. Although less than 3% of goods and services exports go to the United States, tariff increases could hurt exports in industries such as wood, wood products and electronics. Mortgage rates have fallen about 190 basis points from a year ago, supported by euro area monetary easing and recent reforms to strengthen competition in financial markets that reduced refinancing costs. 202  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Latvia Note: Core inflation refers to the harmonised index of consumer prices excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco.

EU Recovery and Resilience Facility grants will finance public investment and measures to improve training and digital adoption in small businesses, with average yearly spending of about 1.7% of GDP in 2025-26. Spending on internal security and defence will increase by 0.5% of GDP in 2025 and by an additional 0.9% of GDP in 2026. Legislated expenditures in social protection and public services, and interest expenses add to spending pressures. A tax on undistributed profits of credit institutions, the transfer of 1 percentage point of gross wages from the mandatory asset-backed private pension pillar to the solidarity-based public pension pillar, and rising excise taxes will partly finance the increased spending in 2025-26. There are also plans to transfer some public administrative functions to the private sector but it remains uncertain if these measures will effectively expand fiscal space. Economic activity will gradually recover, driven by domestic demand Real GDP growth will rebound to 1.1% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. Private consumption will recover gradually, accelerating in 2026 as confidence improves. Public consumption will further increase due to rising spending on defence and public services. Trade policy uncertainty will weigh on exports and business investment. Tight labour markets and planned increases in minimum wages will support wage growth and lead to sticky core inflation. However, a cap on public sector wage growth will moderate wage increases. Delays in the absorption of EU funds due to skilled labour shortages, rising costs and weak capacity in infrastructure planning could weigh on domestic demand. On the upside, a stronger-than\u0002expected impact of fiscal expansion in Germany on euro area growth would raise export demand. Strengthening competition and addressing skills shortages will support business dynamism, innovation and investment Reducing high credit costs calls for lowering switching costs for loans to businesses and strengthening competition enforcement. Listing large state-owned enterprises would help improve their governance and attract investors. Strengthening the powers of the Competition Council to conduct market investigations and enforce competitive neutrality of state-owned enterprises would foster business dynamism, innovation and investment. Reducing social security contributions for low-income earners, raising progressivity of personal income taxes and stepping up enforcement efforts would help reduce informality. This also requires raising trust in institutions and continuing the fight against corruption, for example by applying the heavy fines for tax evasion and bribery that current legislation allows, while ensuring that they are proportionate. Lowering occupation-specific restrictions and facilitating administrative procedures for migrants can help to reduce skilled labour shortages, while investing more in childcare facilities would increase the labour supply of women. Establishing a tri-partite training fund and improving cooperation in training design and implementation among firms and training providers is also key. 204  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Lithuania GDP is projected to grow by 2.7% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after 2.8% in 2024. Strong real wage gains will continue supporting private consumption, especially in 2025. After a decline in 2024, investment is expected to increase progressively, supported by improved financial conditions and higher capacity utilisation but hampered by trade policy uncertainty. Despite a negative carry-over in 2025, exports are expected to increase moderately, but economic activity in the euro area is a key risk for Lithuania, along with global energy prices and geopolitical tensions. The fiscal stance is expected to loosen over 2025-26. Nevertheless, creating additional fiscal space will be key to financing rising ageing-related spending as well as defence spending. Moreover, deepening capital markets will be essential for alleviating the financial constraints that many firms are facing, and supporting investment and productivity growth. Further strengthening the public integrity framework would also support investor confidence. Economic activity has continued to strengthen GDP increased by 2.8% in 2024 as a whole and by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025, largely supported by strong real wage growth and private consumption. Nevertheless, investment declined amid low capacity utilisation and subdued business confidence, especially in services. Consumer confidence remains high but has been declining since the end of 2024. Headline inflation bottomed out in October 2024 and reached 3.6% in April 2025, amid higher food and energy prices. While immigration helped to alleviate some labour shortages, the labour market is tight, with vacancies at a high level and contributing to strong wage growth. Unemployment, at 6.4% in March 2025, is below its long-term average. Lithuania 1. Harmonised index of consumer prices excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco. 2. Total economy.

Higher US tariffs on EU goods will thus indirectly weigh on Lithuania through reduced activity in the European Union, which accounts for 60% of total Lithuanian exports. Fiscal policy is becoming more accommodative Financing conditions, measured by long-term interest rates, have improved compared to a year ago and are expected to stabilise, as the spread vis-à-vis German benchmarks settles around 0.7 percentage points, down from 2.2 percentage points when inflation peaked. The fiscal deficit is expected to increase further from 1.3% in 2024 to 3.0% in 2025 and 2026. The main factors contributing to a higher headline deficit in 2025-26 than in 2024 are related to pension benefits and public wages. The State Defence Council, comprising Lithuania’s political and military leaders, recently agreed to raise defence spending to 5-6% of GDP annually over 2026-30, up from 3% in 2025. While Parliament still needs to approve this plan and clarify financing, and budget cuts are envisaged in non-defence ministries, the increase in defence spending may raise the 2026 fiscal deficit beyond the current projection. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Lithuania Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 56.7 2.5 0.3 2.8 2.7 2.4 Private consumption 31.9 2.0 -0.3 3.5 4.9 4.0 Government consumption 9.9 1.2 -0.2 1.4 1.0 0.8 Gross fixed capital formation 12.7 5.2 9.3 -1.3 4.9 4.6 Final domestic demand 54.5 2.6 1.9 2.0 4.2 3.5 Stockbuilding¹ - 0.4 -0.3 -3.3 1.0 1.6 0.0 Total domestic demand 54.2 2.9 -0.9 3.1 6.1 3.5 Exports of goods and services 45.1 12.4 -3.4 2.1 1.1 2.6 Imports of goods and services 42.6 12.7 -5.3 2.4 5.1 4.2 Net exports¹ 2.5 0.3 1.8 -0.2 -2.7 -1.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 16.1 9.0 3.4 4.7 3.2 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 18.9 8.7 0.9 4.0 2.5 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 10.5 9.6 3.2 2.9 2.4 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 6.0 6.8 7.1 6.3 5.8 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 0.9 3.0 7.9 7.4 6.8 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -0.7 -0.7 -1.3 -3.0 -3.0 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 37.7 38.5 40.3 43.3 44.0 General government debt, Maastricht definition³ (% of GDP) _ 38.1 37.3 38.2 41.4 42.1 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -6.0 1.1 3.0 3.3 2.1 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) 1.

Sustained real wage gains and a lower saving rate will continue supporting private consumption, especially in 2025. Investment is expected to rebound progressively. While lower long-term interest rates and higher capacity utilisation will support investment, trade policy uncertainty is likely to hamper it. Exports are projected to pick up but will remain closely connected to external demand from Lithuania’s main trading partners. Economic activity in the euro area is thus a key risk for Lithuania, along with global energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Structural reforms would improve fiscal sustainability and support investment Lithuania will face a major demographic shock that will increase pension-related costs, with high old-age poverty and low life expectancy for men making it difficult to contain these pressures. In this context, creating additional fiscal space will be needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. This will require improving the efficiency of public spending, increasing tax revenues and encouraging formal economic activity. Strengthening productivity growth will sustain living standards despite population ageing. While Lithuania’s product market regulations and insolvency framework are among the most conducive to productivity growth in the OECD, many firms are facing financial constraints. The development of capital markets would support productivity growth by facilitating investment in intangibles, research and development, and technological innovation. This requires increasing the supply and demand of non-bank capital, including by mobilising institutional investors such as pension funds, leveraging digital financing, and listing a wider range of state-owned enterprises. Further strengthening the public integrity framework, including by systematically monitoring the post-public employment activities of high-ranking public officials and reinforcing leadership support for integrity measures in public institutions, would also limit perceived corruption and support investor confidence.  207 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Luxembourg GDP is projected to grow by 2.1% in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026, following a strong rebound in activity in the final quarter of 2024. Private consumption will remain robust as real wage growth, bolstered by receding inflation and rising wage rates, supports households’ real disposable income. Lower interest rates will provide stimulus to the financial and construction sectors. Risks are broadly balanced. Construction and finance may recover faster than expected. Weaker activity in the euro area and increasing barriers to trade could dampen the recovery. Fiscal policy should remain prudent through the full phasing-out of energy policy supports. A comprehensive pension reform, to raise contributions, increase the effective retirement age and adjust benefits, is needed to ensure sustainability for future generations. Rising capacity constraints imply the need to transition from a growth model based on rapid labour force growth to one based on innovation and skills, while maintaining public investment in transport and climate mitigation actions. Housing affordability should be tackled through reforms aimed at relaxing structural barriers to developing supply. Economic activity recovered strongly in the final quarter of 2024 Industrial production and construction activity rose slightly through 2024. Lower interest rates fuelled the recovery of the financial sector and of housing transactions in the last quarter of 2024. High-frequency indicators and the decline in new loans for house purchases suggest a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025. Business confidence indicators in most non-financial services have recovered since the sharp fall in 2024Q3 but remain below historical averages. While labour shortages persist, they have significantly eased from the post-pandemic peak. Wage indexation supported households’ purchasing power and private consumption through 2024, despite weak consumer sentiment. In the year to April 2025, despite the partial lifting of energy price supports and some increase in food and energy prices, headline inflation fell to 1.7% (down from 3.2% in April 2024) and core inflation to 2.1%.

However, indirect effects through weaker demand from European partners, including automotive components from Germany, are expected. Furthermore, lower equity prices and weaker household income growth in Europe may slow activity in the financial sector. Fiscal policy will remain prudent The government budget recorded a small surplus in 2024, mostly thanks to higher revenues from direct business taxes and lower current outlays. Despite the scaling back of energy policy support, the budget balance is projected to return to a small deficit in 2025 and 2026 due to increasing defence expenditures, which should reach 2% of GDP by 2030, up from 1.3% in 2024. Overall, the fiscal stance is projected to ease by 1.7% of GDP over 2025 and 2026. The recovery in activity is expected to continue Growth is projected to strengthen gradually over 2025 and 2026, as easing financial conditions bolster the financial and construction sectors. Despite increased global uncertainty, domestic consumption will be resilient, due to the scheduled wage indexation in 2025Q2 supporting real incomes, and to a modest draw\u0002down of household savings towards their long-term average rate.

Amid global uncertainty and growing barriers to trade, the contribution of exports to GDP will remain modest. Risks are broadly balanced, with a faster than-expected recovery in finance and construction representing the main upside risk. The main downside risks include a slowdown of economic activity in the euro area, potential financial markets disruptions, and a contraction of exports linked to tariffs. Structural reforms are necessary to boost productivity growth and ensure fiscal and environmental sustainability To safeguard fiscal sustainability, a comprehensive pension reform is needed to raise contributions, increase the effective retirement age and contain expenditures. Productivity is high relative to the EU area average but growth is stagnant. Structural reforms are necessary to support private investment in innovation and improve the quality of life-long training, including through better coordination across the main public actors supporting R&D, and a shift from the current institution-oriented system to a project\u0002oriented one. Quality standards for training providers can be strengthened by introducing a national accreditation agency and by tightening quality controls. Despite substantial progress, further efforts to implement the national energy and climate plan and strengthen public transport are needed to meet climate targets, mitigate congestion and improve attractiveness to cross-border workers. 210  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Malaysia GDP is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. Private consumption will remain robust, supported by favourable labour market conditions. Investment growth will benefit from new opportunities in technology-intensive sectors, although global trade tensions are generating significant risks. Inflation is expected to rise amid a planned removal of fuel subsidies and potential wage pressures. Government debt has increased to 64.6% of GDP in 2024. Fiscal consolidation is needed to rebuild fiscal space, including by mobilising more revenues and phasing out energy subsidies. The neutral monetary policy stance should be maintained in the short term. Substantial gender gaps are hampering women’s economic opportunities, which could be addressed by investing more in childcare support and promoting workplace flexibility. Reducing skill mismatches could boost both growth and social inclusion. The economy has been growing steadily Real GDP grew by 5.1% in 2024, largely driven by private consumption and to a lesser extent investment. After a small contraction in late 2024, GDP growth rebounded in the first quarter of 2025, with 0.7% growth quarter-on-quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Inflation has been contained, with neither annual headline nor core inflation exceeding 2% since August 2024, despite an uptick in core inflation in early 2025. Meanwhile, the labour market has been strong as unemployment fell to 3.0% in March 2025, its lowest level since April 2015, while labour force participation rose to an all-time high of 70.7% in the same month. Exports grew strongly in 2024 and shipments to the United States, Malaysia's third largest export destination, accounted for about the half of the growth of merchandise exports. Exports to China, the country's second largest export market, declined by 2.2%. Due to strong import growth, however, net exports made only a marginal contribution to growth. These trends continued in the first three months of 2025. Tourist arrivals have now recovered to well above their 2019 levels. Exports to the United States accounted for 13.2% of merchandise exports and 10.3% of GDP in 2024, and a 10% tariff is now being applied to merchandise imports from Malaysia, although there some exemptions for particular products.  211 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Malaysia Source: CEIC.

The lower deficit will help bring down government debt, which has increased rapidly from 52.4% of GDP in 2019 to 64.6% in 2024 and create fiscal space to address rising long-term spending pressures related to social protection and climate change. The central bank has maintained the policy rate at 3% since July 2023, which is a broadly neutral monetary policy stance. This stance is expected to continue, although the central bank should remain vigilant in the face of emerging inflationary pressures from the continued withdrawal of fuel subsidies, increases in the minimum wage and civil servants’ salaries, and tight labour market. The economy will grow moderately, but faces significant downside risks Output is projected to grow by 3.8% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026. Private consumption will be buoyed by favourable labour market conditions, although the withdrawal of fuel subsidies will weigh on the real purchasing power of some households. Private investment will be supported by new opportunities in technology-intensive sectors. Infrastructure projects and investments by public corporations will support public investment. Inflation is projected to rise slightly to 2.2% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026, reflecting progress in fuel subsidy withdrawal. Export growth will be affected by global trade tensions and high levels of uncertainty, which could have more negative effects than currently assumed, particularly if tariff rates rise further. On the domestic front, stronger than expected inflationary pressures remain a downside risk. Structural reforms can reduce inequalities and make growth more sustainable Improving the targeting of social protection while raising social assistance coverage and benefit levels would allow stronger reductions of poverty and inequality. Policies to bridge the gender gap, including improving access to affordable childcare and extending paid maternity and paternity leave periods, would allow more women to participate in the labour market and find jobs that match their skills. Measures to reduce skill mismatches, such as expanding the skills registry and investing more into adult education, could boost both growth and social inclusion. Addressing climate change requires accelerating the planned withdrawal of energy subsidies and a stronger role for carbon pricing, complemented by stricter regulations and additional investments. A “National Policy on Climate Change 2.0” was announced in September 2024 and contains ambitious measures in this direction, which should be implemented without unnecessary delays. Private investment could benefit from a more even playing field between private and government\u0002linked enterprises.  213 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Mexico The economy is projected to grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026. Low unemployment and easing inflation will support consumption. Public consumption and investment will remain subdued, given ongoing fiscal consolidation. Exports will be dampened by tariffs, uncertainty and weaker global growth. Investment will be supported by declining interest rates but is expected to recover only gradually, reflecting high uncertainty. Implementing a medium-term fiscal plan could help reduce the deficit gradually, creating room for investments that boost productivity, such as education. To ensure that inflation continues to decrease towards target, the central bank should continue its prudent and gradual easing cycle. Expanding dual vocational programmes would enhance technical skills availability, boosting competitiveness and facilitating access to formal jobs. Agriculture has recovered but investment is slowing Short-term indicators point to a partial improvement in economic activity during the first quarter of 2025, with GDP growing by 0.2% (quarter on quarter), after the 0.6% contraction in the previous quarter. The improvement was driven entirely by a rebound in the agriculture sector, following weather related disruptions at the end of 2024, while industrial production contracted and services stagnated. Non\u0002residential construction is losing momentum after the completion of major infrastructure projects in the South, while investment in machinery and equipment is also easing amid high uncertainty. Private consumption has slowed, in line with slowing formal job creation. Exports remain subdued, constrained by persistent trade-related uncertainty. Unemployment, at 2.6% in March, remains at historically low levels, although participation has recently declined. Inflationary pressures are easing, although headline and core inflation rose to 3.9% (year-on-year) in April, driven by volatility in some food prices and seasonal variations in tourism-related services.

As a result, Mexico is particularly impacted by rising trade restrictions and ongoing uncertainty. The projections assume that Mexico’s exports to the United States that are compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) face a 0% tariff, while non-compliant exports face a 25% tariff, both in 2025 and 2026. Around 50% of Mexico’s exports to the United States are currently compliant. Compliance is assumed to gradually rise towards 75% in 2026 by following the necessary steps, such as completing certifications of origin. Automobiles and automobile parts are assumed to be subject to a 25% tariff rate in 2025 and 2026, with the share of United States content excluded from this tariff. The projections also assume a 25% tariff on United States imports of steel and aluminium products from Mexico. Monetary policy easing and fiscal consolidation should be gradual The central bank has continued its monetary easing cycle, lowering the policy rate to 8.5% in May. Easing inflationary pressures, weakening economic activity and well-anchored inflation expectations support a further gradual, data-dependant reduction in the policy rate to 7% by the end of 2025, with additional cuts in 2026. After widening to 4.9% of GDP in 2024, the highest level in 35 years, the budget deficit is expected to fall to 3.5% in 2025, primarily through cuts in public investment, and to 3% in 2026. By the end of 2026, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be around 52% of GDP. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Mexico Current prices MXN billion GDP at market prices 26 690.0 3.7 3.3 1.5 0.4 1.1 Private consumption 18 236.2 4.8 4.2 2.8 0.5 1.8 Government consumption 3 043.9 2.0 1.8 1.6 0.2 0.3 Gross fixed capital formation 5 687.6 7.5 16.6 3.3 -0.9 1.5 Final domestic demand 26 967.7 5.1 6.6 2.8 0.1 1.6 Stockbuilding¹ 237.7 0.0 -0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 27 205.4 5.0 6.2 2.8 0.2 1.6 Exports of goods and services 10 827.9 9.5 -7.2 3.3 6.8 1.1 Imports of goods and services 11 343.3 8.6 3.7 2.7 3.1 2.4 Net exports¹ - 515.4 0.2 -4.7 0.1 1.2 -0.7 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.6 4.5 4.9 4.4 3.3 Consumer price index _ 7.9 5.5 4.7 3.4 3.2 Core inflation index² _ 7.6 6.7 4.1 3.6 3.2 Unemployment rate³ (% of labour force) _ 3.3 2.8 2.7 2.8 2.8 Government financial balance⁴ (% of GDP) _ -3.2 -3.4 -4.9 -3.5 -3.0 Government gross debt⁴ (% of GDP) _ 48.2 47.4 50.6 51.8 52.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -1.5 -0.3 -0.1 -0.2 -0.4 Percentage changes, volume (2018 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Private consumption will be supported by low unemployment and declining inflation. Private investment will gradually benefit from lower interest rates, though it will remain constrained by high domestic and global uncertainty. Public investment is set to stay subdued as part of efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit. Quarterly export growth will be dampened by trade tariffs and high global uncertainty. Both headline and core inflation will continue to fall gradually. However, the outlook for both growth and inflation remain uncertain. Given Mexico’s high exposure to the US market, the projected US slowdown in 2025-26 and tighter financial conditions may weigh further on external and investment demand. Moreover, increased global risk aversion and exchange rate volatility could raise sovereign borrowing costs and further limit fiscal space. On the upside, a reduction in uncertainty, such as through a swift and successful renegotiation of the trade agreement with the United States and Canada, could support investment and exports more strongly than currently anticipated. Boosting productivity and adapting to climate change are priorities Enhancing immovable property tax collection and improving tax administration, including through digitalisation, could help increase tax revenues and create fiscal space for additional spending in productivity-enhancing areas, such as education or digitalisation. Systematically applying cost-benefit analysis would enhance the efficiency of public spending. A comprehensive early childhood education and care system would facilitate women’s labour market participation. Encouraging private investment in renewable energy through supportive regulations could help turn Mexico's abundant renewable resources into a competitive advantage. Improving water management would strengthen Mexico’s adaptation to climate change, reduce operational risks and help to attract investment. 216  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Netherlands GDP is set to grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2026, driven by strengthening private consumption on the back of rising disposable household income, and government investment. Private investment will also improve, supported by gradually declining interest rates, but will be dampened by global uncertainty. However, external demand will weaken due to higher tariffs and trade uncertainty. Annual headline inflation is set to fall only slowly to 2.9% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, as service price pressures persist. Unemployment will increase marginally from 3.7% in 2024 to 4% in 2026, as the bankruptcy rate rises to pre-pandemic levels. The fiscal stance will be expansionary over 2025-26 due to higher spending on health care, housing and defence, as well as cuts in personal, corporate and environmental taxes. In the short term, fiscal measures are projected to support economic growth but worsen the fiscal balance, with the government deficit projected to widen from 0.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2026. The government should prioritise investments supporting the green transition and productivity, including enhancing digital skills and increasing the adoption of digital technologies. The economy remains resilient In the first quarter of 2025, GDP growth slowed to 0.1% quarter-on-quarter, down from 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Weaker household spending and fixed asset investment weighed on the economy, partly offset by higher public consumption and a smaller reduction in inventories. Headline inflation picked up to 4.1% in April, from 3.4% in the previous quarter, reflecting higher food and service prices. Annual wage growth under collective labour agreements moderated, falling to 5.5% from 6.6% the quarter before. The labour market remained tight, with job vacancies continuing to outnumber unemployed persons, and the unemployment rate stable at 3.8% in April. Consumer confidence continued to decline between January and April. Business sentiment also remained below its long-term average, declining again in April after a modest rebound earlier in 2025.

About 5.7% of goods exports are destined for the United States. However, the most important exports include semiconductor machines and pharmaceuticals, which have so far been exempt from the increase in US import tariffs on EU goods. Indirectly, both through its strong integration in global value chains and as a logistic hub for EU trade, the Dutch economy will be affected via the slowdown in global trade. Fiscal policy is expansionary The fiscal stance will be expansionary over 2025-26, with fiscal easing projected to be around 1.4% of potential GDP, supporting short-term economic growth but worsening the government’s fiscal balance. The budget deficit is projected to widen from 0.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.8% in 2026, in line with government plans for higher spending on health care, housing and defence. These spending increases are partially offset by spending cuts in education, public services and development aid. In 2026, the transfer of military pensions to the Dutch civil service pension fund (ABP) will weigh additionally on the fiscal balance. The government support of low- and middle-income household purchasing power through the introduction of a new reduced tax bracket in income taxation took effect at the beginning of 2025 and will reduce revenues over the projection period. Overall, the debt ratio is expected to rise from the historically low level of 43.3% of GDP in 2024 to 46.8% in 2026. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Netherlands Current prices EUR billion GDP at market prices 891.3 5.0 0.1 1.0 1.3 1.1 Private consumption 380.4 6.9 0.8 1.0 1.5 1.6 Government consumption 226.1 1.3 2.9 3.6 2.4 1.7 Gross fixed capital formation 184.6 3.4 1.2 -0.5 0.4 1.3 Final domestic demand 791.1 4.5 1.5 1.4 1.5 1.6 Stockbuilding¹ 13.6 0.5 -2.3 -0.4 0.3 0.0 Total domestic demand 804.7 5.0 -0.9 1.0 1.9 1.6 Exports of goods and services 769.3 4.5 -0.4 0.1 0.3 1.1 Imports of goods and services 682.7 4.4 -1.7 0.0 0.7 1.6 Net exports¹ 86.6 0.5 1.1 0.1 -0.3 -0.3 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 7.3 5.2 3.3 2.6 Harmonised index of consumer prices _ 11.6 4.1 3.2 2.9 2.5 Harmonised index of core inflation² _ 4.8 6.4 3.2 2.6 2.6 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.5 3.5 3.7 3.9 4.0 Household saving ratio, net3 (% of disposable income) _ 7.1 7.5 9.4 9.7 8.8 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 0.0 -0.4 -0.9 -2.3 -2.8 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 52.7 49.8 47.5 48.3 50.0 General government debt, Maastricht definition⁴ (% of GDP) _ 48.4 45.2 43.3 44.7 46.8 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 6.6 9.9 9.9 9.3 9.1 Percentage changes, volume (2021 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Private consumption will be a key driver, buttressed by a boost in real income as wages continue growing above inflation, though weak consumer confidence may temper the pace of recovery. Investment will recover, supported by gradually declining interest rates and public spending, though uncertainty, tight financial conditions and supply constraints could weigh on the momentum. External demand is expected to remain subdued, reflecting ongoing trade fragmentation, tariff uncertainty and weakening global growth. Annual headline inflation is set to fall only slowly to 2.9% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026, and core inflation is expected to remain sticky slowing to 2.6% in 2026, with rising labour costs continuing to exert upward pressure on services prices. Bankruptcy rates will rise, but lead only to a marginal increase in unemployment from 3.7% in 2024 to 4% in 2026, as the labour market remains tight. The economic outlook is surrounded by significant downside risks, primarily related to rising geopolitical tensions and trade fragmentation. Domestically, labour market tightness remains a key concern. Continued wage growth could maintain price pressures, especially if euro area policy rates are lowered while inflation remains elevated in the Netherlands. While this could erode price competitiveness, weaken purchasing power, and slow private consumption, it could also help to alleviate labour market tightness. Furthermore, trade diversion could lead to lower import prices thereby creating downward pressure on inflation. Enhancing tax efficiency would support growth The Netherlands’ strong fiscal position provides room for a moderately expansionary stance, though rising population ageing and significant investment needs for the green transition will test medium-term fiscal sustainability. To increase the share of renewables in the energy mix, the government needs to support investment in the electricity grid. Long-standing structural challenges also need to be addressed, focussing on easing labour market pressures and supporting productivity growth. Simplifying the tax and benefits system and removing distortions favouring owner-occupied housing could increase productivity-enhancing investment and ease tensions in the labour market. Enhancing digital skills and increasing the adoption of digital technologies particularly among smaller enterprises could further boost productivity growth and maintain competitiveness.  219 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 New Zealand Following the deepest recession since 1991, economic activity began to recover in late 2024. The expansion is expected to continue with growth projected to rise to 0.8% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 supported by lower interest rates. However, increased trade restrictions and high uncertainty about trade policy globally will temper external demand, confidence and the pace of the recovery. Inflation is set to fall further due to lower oil prices and higher spare capacity including in the labour market. The unemployment rate is expected to peak in late 2025 at around 5.4%. With core inflation declining, and inflation expectations well anchored, the central bank should steadily reduce the official cash rate to the neutral rate of around 3% and reduce it further if the recovery falters. The pace of fiscal consolidation is appropriate but may need to be slowed if the expansion stalls. Trend growth will remain modest without energy, innovation, investment and skills reforms to lift lacklustre productivity. A recovery is underway Rebalancing of the economy following a severe episode of post-pandemic overheating is well advanced. Headline inflation has declined towards the midpoint of the central bank’s 1 to 3% target range and core inflation is also declining, albeit more gradually. The economy started to recover in late 2024. The rebound was narrowly based on exports, public consumption and stock building. Private consumption and investment growth remained subdued and consumer confidence fell sharply in early 2025. Indicators for the construction sector are showing signs of bottoming out. Net inwards migration has fallen from a peak of 135 000 per annum (2.6% of the population), to a more sustainable level of around 30 000. Commodity export volumes and prices grew strongly in late 2024 and early 2025, Tourism growth has been buoyant, with arrivals rising to 85% of their pre-pandemic level in 2024, but showed signs of weakening in early2025.

The direct effects of higher trade restrictions are likely to be mainly via weaker export prices rather than lower volumes as in the short run agricultural export volumes are supply driven and New Zealand is a price taker in the United States market. In addition, New Zealand’s export prices are expected to come under pressure from greater competition in markets outside the United States. Weaker external demand is also projected to eventually slow export volume growth, weighing on the expansion. The projections assume no trade policy retaliation by New Zealand. As a result, effects on inflation are assumed to be only indirect, via higher costs in global production chains, as well as cheaper imports other countries that are attempting to sell exports no longer bound for the United States elsewhere. Monetary policy is expected to loosen further while budget consolidation continues With inflation falling and inside the target range the central bank cut the official cash rate by 200 basis points to 3.5% between August 2024 and April 2025. It is assumed to cut the official rate to a neutral level of around 3% during 2025 and should reduce it further if the expansion falters. Public debt has risen significantly, and the budget is coming under pressure from rising pension expenditure and faces growing defence spending needs. The 2025 Budget continues the programme of reducing expenditure as a share of GDP. It also took an important step to address the economy’s low capital intensity by introducing the “Investment Boost”, which allows firms to immediately deduct 20% of the value of a new asset from their taxable income on top of normal depreciation. Provided the expansion continues, the government should continue to fully pursue its programme to reduce expenditure as a share of GDP. This is expected to increase the structural fiscal balance by 1.2% of GDP and 0.2% of GDP in 2025 and 2026 respectively. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 New Zealand Current prices NZD billion GDP at market prices 359.1 3.2 1.9 -0.1 0.8 1.7 Private consumption 202.9 4.2 1.0 0.2 0.3 1.8 Government consumption 73.4 5.2 0.8 0.0 0.3 0.3 Gross fixed capital formation 85.7 4.2 -0.1 -4.6 -1.0 2.7 Final domestic demand 362.0 4.4 0.7 -1.0 0.0 1.7 Stockbuilding¹ 8.7 0.2 -1.7 0.2 0.2 0.0 Total domestic demand 370.7 4.4 -0.9 -0.8 0.2 1.7 Exports of goods and services 77.7 -0.8 11.4 4.2 4.0 1.5 Imports of goods and services 89.4 4.6 -0.6 2.4 1.3 1.4 Net exports¹ - 11.7 -1.3 2.8 0.3 0.6 0.0 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 6.2 3.6 3.6 2.6 1.9 Consumer price index _ 7.2 5.7 2.9 2.4 2.1 Core inflation index2 _ 6.0 5.6 3.5 2.5 2.2 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.3 3.7 4.7 5.3 5.2 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ -3.0 -8.5 -7.8 -6.8 -6.6 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ -2.6 -2.1 -1.8 -1.2 -1.2 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 51.2 54.4 57.0 57.8 58.4 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ -8.8 -6.9 -6.1 -5.0 -4.8 Percentage changes, volume (2009/2010 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

However, escalating trade restrictions, weakening external demand and high trade policy uncertainty are hitting confidence and are set to hold back the recovery. High and rising prices for electricity hedges are contributing to industrial closures and are expected to restrain investment. The unemployment rate is set to peak at around 5.4% in late 2025 before gradually declining as employment growth picks up. Headline inflation is projected to fall to 2.5% in 2025 due to the decline in oil prices. Core inflation is projected to continue falling slowly. A large increase in tariffs on New Zealand exports, or low rainfall that reduces hydroelectricity generation and raises electricity prices would slow growth. However, a faster recovery of investment may occur as the “Investment Boost”, and other reforms to accelerate FDI and infrastructure construction, take hold. Increasing trade and investment linkages is key for sustaining the expansion An increasingly febrile and fractured geoeconomic environment means New Zealand will need to work harder working with like-minded countries to expand trade and encourage foreign direct investment. This is crucial for boosting investment and management skills required to address the chronically low capital\u0002to-labour ratio and poor productivity growth. As well as maintaining low trade policy barriers and further expanding free trade agreements, the government should continue efforts to attract more foreign investment via more streamlined government support and lowering high restrictions. Competition and energy related reforms are required to improve the reliability and affordability of electricity. This is a prerequisite for more investment in digitalisation and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. 222  OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Norway Mainland GDP is projected to increase by 1.7% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. Solid household disposable income growth will boost private consumption. Housing investment will rebound from a slump as interest rates decline. Non-oil business investment will strengthen only slightly due to heightened uncertainty. Oil production is expected to decline markedly. Strong domestic cost pressures, currently pushing up inflation, are expected to subside gradually. The central bank is expected to start cutting the policy rate around mid-2025, as inflation eases. Fiscal policy is set to remain expansionary in 2025-26, worsening the structural non-oil budget balance further. Easing product market regulations and insolvency regimes would spur private investment and productivity, fostering stronger self-driven economic growth. Mainland activity has shown signs of recovery Mainland GDP growth picked up in the first quarter of 2025. Household consumption, which had remained somewhat subdued due to high inflation and high interest rates, grew strongly on the back of solid real wage gains. Housing investment declined considerably through late 2024, and remains depressed. Growth in non-oil business investment has generally remained weak. There are signs of a more broad-based recovery, as both manufacturing production and retail sales have risen in recent months. Business surveys also suggest some momentum in activity, except for construction, in the near term. Headline inflation has been volatile in recent months, largely owing to food and energy prices, and stood at 2.5% in April.

The United States accounts for around 3% of Norway's total exports, so the direct impact of the increased US tariff will be relatively modest. In this projection, Norway is assumed not to introduce a retaliatory tariff and the possible rise in July is assumed not to take place. Nonetheless, Norway will be affected by increased uncertainty in the global economy and a contraction in demand, including for oil and gas. Both oil and gas prices have declined markedly since early April, reducing export and government revenue. Macroeconomic policies will be supportive The central bank has repeatedly postponed the envisaged first rate cut, amid stronger-than-expected inflationary pressures associated with strong wage growth. With inflation expectations well anchored around the 2% target, however, the monetary policy stance is set to become less restrictive starting around mid-2025, with the policy rate expected to be brought down to 3.5% by late 2026. Overall, fiscal policy is expected to be expansionary in 2025 and 2026. Defence spending is to rise to 2.2% of GDP in 2025, and personal income tax and social security contributions are being cut. The Revised National Budget introduces a new electricity support package. It also considerably increases support to Ukraine, albeit with little effect on economic activity in Norway. The structural non-oil budget deficit is expected to widen by more than 2½ percentage points of mainland GDP this year, with the increased support to Ukraine largely accounting for the deviation from the initial budget. The structural non-oil deficit in 2025 is still expected to remain below the 3% of the value of the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) threshold, which has been raised significantly due to substantial increases in GPFG assets over time. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Norway Current prices NOK billion Mainland GDP at market prices1 3 315.3 4.3 0.7 0.6 1.7 1.9 GDP at market prices 4 323.9 3.2 0.1 2.1 0.3 1.6 Private consumption 1 626.3 7.8 -1.2 1.2 2.7 2.2 Government consumption 970.7 1.8 3.4 2.4 1.5 1.1 Gross fixed capital formation 992.2 0.3 -1.5 -1.9 -0.4 2.2 Final domestic demand 3 589.2 4.1 -0.2 0.7 1.6 1.9 Stockbuilding² 92.6 1.4 -0.5 -0.7 0.0 0.0 Total domestic demand 3 681.8 5.6 -0.8 -0.1 1.6 1.8 Exports of goods and services 1 860.9 5.2 0.4 5.7 -1.4 1.6 Imports of goods and services 1 218.8 13.3 -1.5 3.7 1.0 2.5 Net exports² 642.1 -1.5 0.7 1.5 -1.0 -0.1 Memorandum items GDP deflator _ 28.4 -11.1 -0.2 1.7 0.4 Consumer price index _ 5.7 5.5 3.2 3.0 2.3 Core inflation index³ _ 3.6 5.8 3.5 2.9 2.5 Unemployment rate (% of labour force) _ 3.3 3.6 4.0 4.1 4.0 Household saving ratio, net (% of disposable income) _ 4.7 4.0 7.3 7.8 7.9 General government financial balance (% of GDP) _ 25.5 16.5 13.2 10.0 10.3 General government gross debt (% of GDP) _ 42.2 51.0 62.0 60.7 59.5 Current account balance (% of GDP) _ 29.0 16.6 16.9 14.6 12.5 Percentage changes, volume (2022 prices) Source: OECD Economic Outlook 117 database. 1.

Solid growth in real household disposable income, driven by strong wage growth, lower inflation and government support, will drive up private consumption. As interest rates decline, housing investment will pick up in the latter half of 2025 from currently depressed levels. Non-oil business investment will increase only moderately, reflecting heightened uncertainty in the global economy. Oil production, exports and investment are projected to weaken this year. Oil and gas prices could affect the Norwegian economy substantially in both directions. A surge in oil and gas prices would considerably boost export and government revenue. Conversely, an abrupt decline in oil and gas prices would substantially strain the budget balance, especially given the significant deterioration of the structural non-oil budget balance in recent years. Similarly, a sharp drop in the value of GPFG assets would abruptly reduce fiscal space. Public policy needs to stimulate market forces While the Norwegian economy has been bolstered by offshore activity and government spending for some time, spurring private investment and productivity is key to making growth more sustainable. Industrial subsidies have increased substantially in recent years, with too much focus on specific industries such as battery factories and offshore wind projects. The government should stop support to these, and focus instead on further reforming market regulations, notably by reducing administrative burdens and licence requirements for firm entry and alleviating penalties for business failure. This would help ensure fiscal sustainability while boosting private investment, particularly innovative ventures, via market forces.  225 OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VOLUME 2025 ISSUE 1: PRELIMINARY VERSION © OECD 2025 Peru GDP growth is projected to slow to 2.8% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026, with global and domestic policy uncertainty weighing on the outlook. Government spending will moderate as fiscal consolidation resumes. Private investment will remain moderate, constrained by persistent uncertainty and tighter global financial conditions. Private consumption will be supported by low inflation. Export growth will weaken reflecting the direct impact of new US tariffs on Peruvian products and the broader drag from weaker global growth. Inflation is expected to remain close to the central bank’s 2% target. The Central Bank’s broadly neutral monetary stance is appropriate and should remain cautious and data dependent. The government plans gradual consolidation in 2025 and 2026 to align the deficit with fiscal rules, but rising expenditure pressures and optimistic revenue projections make compliance challenging, requiring additional measures to meet fiscal targets. Streamlining permits, easing regulatory burdens, and strengthening subnational investment capacity can help crowd in private investment. Strong domestic demand propelled the economic recovery GDP rose by 3.3% in 2024, led by strong domestic demand and a rebound in agricultural and mining exports. Public investment rose by 14% and private consumption was supported by pension fund withdrawals. Private investment began to recover moderately, aided by improved business sentiment, looser financial conditions, and newly awarded Public-Private Partnership contracts. Historically high terms of trade supported the current account. Monthly GDP indicators show that growth remained strong in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP expanding by 3.9% year-on-year. Inflation remains well anchored within the central bank’s 1–3% target band, with headline and core inflation rising by 1.6% and 1.9% in April relative to the previous year, respectively, and expectations close to 2%. Despite a 0.8% rise in employment in 2024, real wages in the formal sector remain below 2019 levels, while high informality and weak participation persist, particularly for women and youth. Peru 1.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote7) Close footnote The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote8)The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote9)Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote10)The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote11)The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. Close footnote ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote12)The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote13)By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote14)Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote15) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote16)Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote17)In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote18) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote19)In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote20)In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote21)Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. Close footnote Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows. [22](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote22)Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote23)Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote24) Close footnote A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote25)Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote26)A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote27)ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively. This is despite widespread condemnation from independent human rights bodies and refrains from the judiciary.[28](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote28)Following bulldozer action in the aftermath of the 2023 Nuh riots, the Punjab and Haryana High Court questioned whether the targeted demolitions of Muslim houses amounted to “an exercise of ethnic cleansing … by the State.”[29](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote29) Close footnote ## **Toward a Hindu** _**rashtra**_ **?** Religious polarization is likely to get worse in the run-up to the elections, with the BJP well-positioned to benefit electorally from the consolidation of a Hindu voting bloc.[30](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote30)At a campaign event during the ongoing elections, Modi himself stirred up communal tensions by referring to Muslims as “infiltrators” and raising alarms that the opposition planned to redistribute the country’s wealth to Muslims, a claim that was widely dismissed as misleading.[31](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote31)A recent report by the Washington, DC-based India Hate Lab found that hate speech, mainly directed against Muslims, peaked during campaigning for Indian state elections in 2023; the BJP won three of the five states that went to polls.[32](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote32)Anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots, where Hindu mobs reportedly killed hundreds of Muslims, also helped Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat, remain in power for over a decade before propelling his rise to the national level.[33](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote33)Besides the ‘Hindi heartland’ states of North and Central-West India, which have historically seen high levels of communal violence, religious polarization can also be expected to drive an increase in violence in states such as Kerala and West Bengal, as the BJP seeks to capitalize on Hindu pride to expand its political footprint.[34](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote34)The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote35)The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. Close footnote A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote36)Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote37)For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](https://acleddata.com/acleddata.com#footnote38) Close footnote _**Visuals in this report were produced by Ana Marco.**_ ## Footnotes 01.

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. CPI-Maoist and all other Naxal groups are designated as terrorist organizations. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States. The affected States have approached the insurgency with a mixture of policies including negotiation, development programs, and security programs. The Center government has also instituted programs to assist affected states, primarily through funding State programs.

Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade. But that may start to change. As China forges deeper ties with India's nuclear archrival, Pakistan, and as each...",

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. ## Document Type Book ## Publication Date 10-2016 ## Publisher National Defense University Press ## City Washington, DC ## Recommended Citation Lynch, Thomas F.

Currently, around 50 GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded across India due to transmission bottlenecks, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. India needs a comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap that incorporates cluster-level demand forecasting to anticipate emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs. Given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, India must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. Over the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy (RE), ranking third behind China and the US in installations and power generation. More than 71% of India's total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately [247 gigawatt (GW),](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/) comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India's power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, [around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/indias-stranded-renewable-projects-double-to-over-50-gw-industry-documents-show/articleshow/123042172.cms?from=mdr), resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad [reaffirmed](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/cea-revises-transmission-plans-every-six-months-for-600-gw-renewables-integration/124114939) the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. **Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system** Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan's great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan's 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The [Rajasthan government’s proposal](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/government-to-establish-2k-mwh-battery-storage-plant-for-solar-power/124316705?utm_source=top_news&utm_medium=sectionListing) this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour(MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. **The need for a strategic roadmap** A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

(AHMAD SAHEL ARMAN/AFP via Getty Images) By improving ties with the Taliban, India is seeking to reduce security risks, counterbalance Pakistan’s influence and improve economic opportunities in Afghanistan. But this strategy is likely to achieve only modest results because of Afghanistan’s fragile economic and security environment, as well as New Delhi’s enduring ideological and cultural differences with the Taliban. Indian officials recently visited Afghanistan for the first time since the Taliban took control of the country last year. A delegation led by J.P. Singh -- a secretary overseeing India’s external affairs with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran -- traveled to Kabul on June 6 to discuss the delivery of humanitarian aid with Taliban leaders. With the exception of sending such aid and indirectly contacting Afghanistan through third countries, New Delhi had not established a formal dialogue with Kabul since the Taliban seized power in August 2021. The diplomatic visit reflects India’s new policy of engagement with the...

The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, opens new tab when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington to counter China, political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies discriminating against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - aim to benefit all Indians.

The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups. Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced. Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population. Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K.

The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

    "full_text": "There is a big change happening in India’s power sector; lines of code are now making decisions that engineers and bureaucrats used to make. The country’s electricity grid, which has long been associated with outages, inefficiency, and high losses, is evolving into a digitally empowered network in which real-time data, sensors, and automation drive supply, demand, and distribution. However, as this change accelerates, the essential question is no longer whether India can develop a smart grid, but how and who controls it, particularly as technology replaces current institutional structures. The National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and the Ministry of Power intend to transform India’s electrical system into a “secure, adaptive, sustainable, and digitally enabled ecosystem” via stakeholder perception. India has deployed over 40 million smart meters by mid-2025, indicating progress in the development of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). However, despite lofty goals and hardware deployment, obstacles remain. FSR Global’s March 2025 research identified a fundamental problem in developing an interoperable smart grid ecosystem, including limitations in standards, insufficient data governance, vendor fragmentation, and cyber-security concerns. Smart grids usher in a fundamentally new form of “governance”—one mediated by algorithms. AI-powered systems predict loads, reroute supply, detect defects, and (in some situations) determine dynamic tariffs. Cities like Delhi are the first to use these kinds of technologies, and state utilities are working with companies from around the world to use advanced analytics. For example, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (MSEDCL) made a deal with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to improve its system with AI, machine learning, and battery energy storage devices. But this choice makes it hard to tell who is at fault. If an algorithm sends out goods incorrectly, places businesses ahead of families, or charges a peak surcharge, who is to blame? The rules and laws haven’t been updated to align with how technology operates in the real world. If algorithmic decisions aren’t clear, operations might not be clear either. In the smart grid, data is as important as copper lines. Smart meters collect specific consumption patterns down to the appliance level; an analytics tool interprets the data and utilises it to improve network performance. But this makes people worry about privacy, security, and fairness. A recent poll by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) found that consumers are worried about billing accuracy, connectivity issues, and data privacy, which are all making it harder to roll out smart meters. Regulatory frameworks also fall behind. While the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2022, includes significant structural reforms, it does not address data ownership rights, algorithmic transparency, or consumer redress. Unless these loopholes are bridged, smart grids may recreate existing hierarchies in a new digital format. India is switching to smart grids for a number of reasons, but one of the most important is to deal with the growing amount of renewable energy, largely solar and wind, that is being used more and more at the distribution level. Smart systems help balance energy generation that happens at different times, control battery storage, and make prosumer (consumer-plus-producer) possible. The government also recently extended the interstate transmission system (ISTS) charge waiver for battery energy storage projects until June 2028. This is a big incentive for stabilising grids with a lot of renewable energy. However, as one FT analysis on the “solar village” project in Gujarat highlighted, storage capacity remains a bottleneck: India needs 336 GWh by 2030, but predictions for 2026-27 are just 82 GWh. Not every state is moving at the same rate. In Karnataka, the implementation of smart meters under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) has suffered delays. A state official recently stated that even with subsidies, costs will not drop below Rs 1,000 per meter in Bengaluru. The state is still reviewing whether to opt in. In another example, India’s transmission authority recently withdrew grid access for approximately 17 GW of delayed clean-energy projects in states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in order to prioritise projects that are ready for implementation. For areas experiencing energy poverty, the transition to smart grids is about more than just efficiency; it’s about justice. The promise of increased reliability, lower losses, and lower tariffs exists, but only if the transformation is equitable. The key dimensions of justice include distributive, procedural, and recognitional. These measures demonstrate that, even as smart grid technology advances, execution limits. If smart grid governance remains opaque, the risk is a two-tier energy system: a “well-connected algorithmic” grid for some and a weak heritage grid for others. To make smart grids work for India, not just utilities, policy must keep up with technology. Algorithmic accountability frameworks require openness, auditability, and human monitoring in grid-decision systems. Data governance regime aims to figure out who owns data about how consumers use electricity, how it can be used and shared, and how to get consent. In systemic cyber resilience, it is needed to ensure that even smaller DISCOMs establish Cyber Security Operations Centers (CSOCs) and undertake regular audits. Equitable rollout options include prioritising states with high energy poverty for meter improvements, analytics tools, and demand-response programs. Secondly, interoperability standards accelerate the integration of grid protocols, vendor systems, and communication networks to prevent smart systems from becoming proprietary silos. Power plants and transmission lines will no longer define India’s energy future; instead, algorithms will play an increasingly important role. But the real test is how those algorithms are run: do they help people or systems? Do they help make things fairer or make things worse? Smart grids provide the basis for the transformation that India needs to make in order to reach its goal of 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. The grid might be getting smarter, but the people in charge need to be too. India’s move to smart grids is more than just a technological leap; it also means a change in how the energy business is run, how people are held accountable, and how justice is served. As computers take over more and more of the control of electricity flows, the decision of who gets energy, when, and for how much money moves from people to machines. This move, although promising to make things more efficient and reliable, also shows some big hazards, such as breaches of data privacy, unequal access, and slow government action. As India moves from physical to digital infrastructure, it needs to make sure that the intelligence that runs its grids is fair, accessible, and overseen by the people.

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Home » Power without passage: How stranded renewables expose cracks in India’s grid planning Power without passage: How stranded renewables expose cracks in India’s grid planning India’s rapid renewable energy growth is outpacing its transmission capacity, leaving gigawatts of clean power stranded across states Over the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy (RE), ranking third behind China and the US in installations and power generation. More than 71 percent of India’s total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately 247 gigawatt (GW), comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India’s power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad reaffirmed the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan’s great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan’s 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The Rajasthan government’s proposal this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour (MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. The need for a strategic roadmap A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.",

Surrounding the golden fortress city of Jaisalmer in India’s Thar desert, a sea of wind turbines stretches out across the arid landscape as far as the eye can see — visibly marking the world’s third-largest carbon emitter’s green power expansion. Engineers at a 30MW wind farm here operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest clean energy developers, speak with pride about contributing to a national renewable capacity goal of 500GW by 2030. Yet not all of the country’s green power can be dispatched, with the energy grid emerging as a choking constraint. Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew, is confident India will “definitely” achieve its renewable capacity target. “I can see that we’ll get to 500GW, but we won’t be able to exceed it because there’s not enough transmission.” While India boasts one of the world’s largest transmission networks, spanning more than 494,000 circuit kilometres, the grid has not kept pace with the surge in renewable projects. More than 50GW of capacity is stranded, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a US-based think-tank, and JMK Research & Analytics, an Indian cleantech research and consulting firm. © Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images “Transmission has become a critical bottleneck . . . causing rising curtailment and commissioning delays in resource-rich states,” says Jyoti Gulia, founder and chief executive of JMK. Earlier this year, Pralhad Joshi, India’s minister for new and renewable energy, hailed a “Historic Green Leap” after the country reached 50 per cent of its [power capacity from renewables](https://www.ft.com/content/a99a5845-9f50-49a3-8c7c-d704b2cf3b95), now totalling 243GW. Even so, Gulia says, grid expansion delays would “lock in higher coal generation”. Nearly three-quarters of India’s power currently comes from coal, which remains central to meeting its growing electricity demand. This is partly due to fragmented planning between state and central authorities, which largely run India’s grid, as well as mismatched build cycles. Renewable projects can be completed in 12 to 18 months, while transmission lines typically take three to five years. Clean power is also predominantly produced in three states: Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while high demand regions such as Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have little capacity, making cross state delivery critical. “To perfect the timing is impossible,” Ashish Khanna, chief executive of Adani Green Energy — the country’s largest renewable power company — said in September at the Financial Times’ Energy Transition Summit in New Delhi. “You can’t first wait for a grid to come and then build a renewable project.” Those constraints have become the most visible in the northwestern wind and sun-rich state of Rajasthan and development heavy areas there such as Jaisalmer. IEEFA and JMK estimate that 8GW of clean power capacity in the state currently cannot be transmitted. One renewable industry executive in Rajasthan says the “spurt” of green projects, paired with slow grid growth, will probably slow further capacity build out for at least a couple of years. Developers also face obstacles from environmental blockages and grinding [difficulties acquiring contiguous land](https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e) in a country with hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers. In parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat, a years-long legal ban has prevented new overhead transmission lines from being laid across more than 100,000 sq km to protect the Great Indian Bustard, a [highly endangered and poor-sighted bird](https://www.ft.com/content/cec843fe-804a-43a4-b89a-4f7970c3a6a4) known to fly into power cables. In key areas, smaller players have also exploited those time lags, pre-booking chunks of transmission capacity with no intention of building power plants — driving up premiums to secure connectivity, which they then sell to developers. This delays projects and further burdens genuine operators. Gulia says the bureaucratic need for multi-agency clearances and right-of-way permits that are frequently initiated post-award cause “months to years of delay”. Ideally there should be a single-window regulatory clearance system with strict timelines, she says, as well as performance-based incentives and disincentives. Last year India announced a plan to bolster the power grid and deploy the vast amounts of renewable energy coming online. The expansion is expected to cost Rs9.15tr ($104bn) to allow the transmission of 600GW of green power capacity by 2032. However, India’s Central Electricity Authority agency has acknowledged that public funding will not be sufficient to cover the build-out, which means the private sector is likely to have to step in. Private investment from the likes of Adani and Tata Power is already starting to reshape the sector, Khanna at Adani Green says. About 9 per cent of the grid is operated by corporates. “They are going to bring their own efficiencies to the system,” adds Khanna, “so I am hopeful that in times to come we will have less \\[of a\\] gap.” ### Europe’s Climate Leaders _The FT is compiling its sixth annual list of Europe’s climate leaders.

    "full_text": "Indias power grid faces significant challenges absorbing a surge in solar installations, leading to record curtailment rates. India’s power grid is struggling to absorb a surge in solar power installations, leading to more curtailment that threatens the build-out of renewables and underscores the need for energy storage. The curtailment rate for solar generation in October rose to about 12 per cent, the highest since May when Grid Controller of India Ltd. started publishing the data. On some days, about 40 per cent of solar power output was denied access to the national network. Curtailments measure how much electricity was generated without finding its way to customers. The data points to a deepening mismatch between supply and demand when solar generation floods the grid during the day time. Coal power plants can’t reduce output fast enough to make room for surging solar output, and the fossil fuel must be kept in operation as it’s needed to meet demand after the sun sets. The month also saw rare curtailments of wind power, the data showed. This highlights the need to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources with storage, like grid-scale batteries, so that excess electricity can be dispatched in the evening. India has about 44-gigawatts worth of green projects that are struggling to find state utilities to buy their electricity. The government is considering canceling projects where prospects of an offtake deal looks minimal, threatening a goal of doubling clean power capacity to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade.

India's power grid is struggling to absorb a rapid surge in solar installations, leading to increased curtailment that threatens the pace of renewable expansion and underscores the urgent need for large-scale energy storage. The curtailment rate for solar generation in October rose to about 12 per cent, the highest since May when Grid Controller of India Ltd. began publishing such data. On some days, as much as 40 per cent of solar power output was denied access to the national grid. Curtailment measures the share of electricity generated but not delivered to consumers. The data highlights a growing mismatch between supply and demand during daytime hours when solar output peaks. Coal-fired plants, which provide base-load power, cannot reduce generation quickly enough to accommodate the solar surge - yet must remain operational to meet demand after sunset. The month also witnessed wind power curtailment, reinforcing the need to integrate intermittent renewable sources with energy storage systems, such as grid-scale batteries, that can dispatch excess electricity in the evening. Currently, about 44 GW of renewable projects in India are struggling to secure PPAs with state utilities.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets, and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama, and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...
