These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India [CPI]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external secu\u0002rity partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of do\u0002mestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an In\u0002dian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime secu\u0002rity activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counter\u0002terrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington. 2 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Introduction This paper frames the contours of the recent and ongoing expansion in U.S.-India security ties. Then it briefly sketches the trajectory of the Naxalite insurgency through its first two phases and then focuses on the factors that made its third phase—from 2004 to the present—such a serious security challenge. The paper highlights the unique domestic factors that allowed the Naxalite rebellion’s rise to the status of India’s most significant internal security challenge from 2007 to 2010. It also identifies those domestic factors that enabled effective counterinsurgency actions beginning in 2011 and effective containment of the threat by 2014. After indicating the kinds of bilateral security assistance offered by the United States to India in recent years, the paper indicates the limited appeal of outside assistance to India in the domestic counterinsur\u0002gency arena and assesses why India’s self-selected counterinsurgency partnership limitations remain firmly in place. It concludes with some lessons learned for U.S. policymakers in terms of the opportunities and limitations for working with India in matters of domestic insurgency, advising that these limitations make sense on many levels. It also asserts that India’s limitations should be respected in Washington and Honolulu to avoid backlash from New Delhi. Any such backlash might threaten far more important U.S.-India bilateral interests in which shared mari\u0002time and other strategic interests seem to increasingly diverge with those of China and in areas of mutual benefit from global counterterrorism cooperation. The analysis in this paper is based on 3 years of author research into the unique features of the Naxalite insurgency in India. The research includes field interviews conducted on three visits to India during 2014 and 2015, one of which featured time in Kolkata and West Bengal. Expanding U.S.-India Security Framework, with Limits Growing for more than a decade, bilateral defense and security cooperation between the United States and India began accelerating quickly in 2014 and continued into 2016. Much of this acceleration, although not all of it, owed to the tone and tenor of the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected and seated in 2014. Modi’s government, which is Indian nationalist with a dynamic economic, diplomatic, and security agenda, followed a decade-long Indian National Congress (INC) government that had become sclerotic in its dealings with the United States and other global partners from 2009 to 2013. The INC government set the table for U.S.-India defense and security cooperation during the mid-2000s, demonstrating a broad\u0002based Indian commitment to improved bilateral relations with the United States after decades 3 India’s Naxalite Insurgency of limited transactions. But the nationalist government of Prime Minister Modi has been driv\u0002ing it forward vigorously. The ongoing acceleration in broad Indo-American relations has taken many forms, in\u0002cluding high diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi made visiting the United States a priority, travel\u0002ing to America within 4 months of his May 2014 accession to the position of prime minister. Modi then made President Barack Obama the first ever U.S. President bestowed the high honor as chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade in January 2015. During this visit, Obama and Modi signed a historic Joint U.S.-India Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.1 Modi made a third informal visit to the United States in September 2015, using this historically rapid return to enhance economic relations between the national private and public sectors.2 The United States has committed to a wide array of economic projects in India fea\u0002turing public-private innovation, deeper financial cooperation and inclusive digital networks, “smart city” development in selected Indian cities, and support for increasing economic con\u0002nectivity between India and the states of South and Southeast Asia.3 The acceleration of broad bilateral ties has been showcased by the steady increase in de\u0002fense and security cooperation between the two countries. In June 2016, on a historic fourth visit to the United States and in conjunction with a third bilateral summit,4 Prime Minister Modi made a joint statement with President Obama declaring India and the United States to be “major defense partners,” expressing aspirations for expanded exchange of dual-use technolo\u0002gies and maritime security cooperation.5 The outcomes from this mid-2016 leadership engage\u0002ment underscored the fact that there have been noteworthy enhancements in military technol\u0002ogy interaction processes, basic military logistics and administrative arrangements, and joint military exercises. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi has accelerated the process of bilateral security collabo\u0002ration on military modernization with emphasis on greater foreign investment in the Indian defense sector than ever before. Modi’s government covets American participation in India’s defense industry build-out to a degree not seen in the previous Indian government. The United States has worked to expand its 2012 bilateral defense initiative with India known as the U.S.- India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Pursuant to President Obama’s January 2015 visit for Republic Day, the United States has focused DTTI in pursuit of six major defense technology co-development and co-production efforts. There has been a particular focus on deeper cooperation in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.6 The United States and India also have done serious work on establishing basic frame\u0002work defense agreements that would enable closer cooperation and collaboration between their 4 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 militaries. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, both governments worked hard to develop mutu\u0002ally acceptable text for three critical military-to-military agreements. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), Basic Exchange and Coopera\u0002tion Agreement (BECA), and—perhaps the most consequential of the three—Logistics Supply Agreement.7 Aimed to move beyond the limited U.S.-India 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement that underpinned modest U.S.-India defense interactions for more than a decade, the bilateral effort on these documents demonstrated important forward prog\u0002ress. Yet this progress did not beget culmination in formal agreements. Many observers hoped that these arrangements would be ready for signature during Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s April 2016 visit to New Delhi for discussions with Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar. But Indian sensitivities and complications in language and trust limited the April joint announce\u0002ment to one confirming that the defense leaders were agreed in principal—but had not yet signed—a modified Logistics Supply Agreement, known as a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement.8 It also signaled that both parties must continue to work on “other” agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer. The CISMOA and BECA were not formally mentioned in the final statement of the meeting.9 In the area of joint military exercises, the U.S.-India partnership has been expanding. In 2015, India conducted more joint military exercises with the U.S. military than any other in the world.10 India and United States agreed in 2015 to extend a permanent invitation for Japanese naval forces to participate annually in Exercise Malabar. The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations. While agreeing to participate in the 2016 Malabar exercise with Japan and the United States in the northern Philippines, India firmly declined an offer by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, to sign on for joint naval patrols with the United States, Japan, and Aus\u0002tralia in the South Pacific.12 India also has remained wary of any firm commitment to a bilateral defense CISMOA or BECA. Despite more than 2 years of bilateral effort, there remains no real progress on the joint development of jet engines or aircraft carrier technologies—both of which are target technologies for joint development.13 Each of these factors and more demonstrate that crafting a bilateral defense partnership between the United States and India will be a slow process 5 India’s Naxalite Insurgency that requires better understanding of differing critical equities. This process requires sustained, patient leadership in both countries in the face of certain frustrations moving forward. Scoping Bilateral Security Collaboration Limits: Indian Domestic Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism The U.S. and Indian militaries have their own detailed and unique experiences in counter\u0002insurgency operations, so counterinsurgency seems a logical focal point for greater U.S.-India defense collaboration and partnership, and in many ways it is. But in other ways, it is not. U.S. policymakers and security analysts should understand the differences. When it comes to outside assistance and security partnership collaboration with India in its ongoing experiences with domestic insurgency, U.S. policymakers and military leaders must remain aware that India does not—and likely will not—treat U.S. military offers of direct assis\u0002tance with a warm welcome. India’s experiences with its long-running domestic Naxalite insur\u0002gency provide a powerful example about the limited scope for U.S. military engagement and the circumspect manner in which any U.S. security assistance must be approached with New Delhi. The lessons about context, tenor, and tone found in the example of the Naxalite insurgency over the past 10 years demonstrate that the United States is a better partner for India when remaining at distance, as New Delhi deals with its unique domestic insurgency challenges. India’s Approach to Domestic Insurgency Over the past 60 years, India has confronted three major domestic insurgencies.14 In Jam\u0002mu and Kashmir, disaffected Muslim groups and unsatisfied local populations have contested India’s so-called occupation of its territories on the southeastern side of the Line of Control. India’s northeast has undergone multiple, overlapping waves of tribal, socioethnic-based insur\u0002gent movements since the mid-1950s. These northeastern separatist insurgencies have ebbed and flowed as Indian military and political approaches to their grievances eliminated some and catalyzed others. India also has been confronted with economic class–based violence and armed confrontation in its eastern regions, violence referred to as a Naxalite or Maoist insurgency. Numerous Indian analysts, and some outsiders, argue that India has among the best re\u0002cords in the world when combating insurgencies.15 The claim is debatable on many levels. Yet it does accurately reflect that India has persistent experience with a variety of domestic insurgencies over a considerable period of time. Official Indian counterinsurgency doctrine formally espouses a population-centric strategy focused on winning “hearts and minds.”16 A more detailed examination of India’s record reveals that India often does take a political 6 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 approach in combination with a military one when facing domestic insurgencies. However, India’s political approaches often are less about hearts and minds and more often feature ex\u0002tended periods of national-level tolerance of state- and local-level politician and police leader\u0002ship manipulation of insurgent groups. Often this manipulation is in the pursuit of regional and local vote banks (or vote blocks). Frequently manipulation is followed by the co-option of rebellion elites in an effort to buy-out, or limit the insurgency once it festers to a level beyond the ability of the state and regional authorities to manage. Co-option approaches have taken the forms of turning insurgents through monetary compensation, creating new political space for a “turned” insurgent group, or abducting and torturing key insurgent leaders.17 Quite often these nonkinetic approaches have created their own problems with corrupt security forces, increased criminal activity, and a litany of human rights complaints and investigations.18 India’s employment of military forces in domestic counterinsurgency operations has fea\u0002tured a number of innovative practices, some successful and others counterproductive. When engaged fully, the Indian national response tends to feature a combination of state police forces, Central Armed Police Forces, special paramilitary units, and—in some cases such as Kashmir and India’s Northeast—the introduction of regular army units. India’s federal statutes mandate that the chief minister (or governor) of a state formally request national police (including Cen\u0002tral Armed Police Forces units), paramilitary, or national army support before such forces can be introduced into a counterinsurgency fight. In those cases when the army is introduced, it must be authorized by the prime minister and given authorities by the Indian parliament to operate under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which includes the authority for military forces to make arrests, search without warrants, and shoot to kill civilians when required.19 In\u0002dia’s martial counterinsurgency activities are normally “enemy centric” and have been assessed to regularly feature a strategy of attrition and raw coercion where overwhelming numbers of security forces attempt to suffocate the insurgency at the same time that political activities are conducted to co-opt its leadership.20 There are several important conclusions to be drawn about India’s historical approach to domestic counterinsurgency. First, India does pursue varied counterinsurgency approaches to its multiple domestic insurgencies, depending on the unique context of each. Some respons\u0002es—such as those in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast India—have featured a permanent deployment of the Indian army. Other responses, such as those toward the respective phases of the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India, have been limited to national central armed police forces (mainly but not exclusively Central Reserve Police Forces [CRPF]) deployment into the unsettled states from the central government (see appendix B for detail on national special 7 India’s Naxalite Insurgency police units). Second, India’s political and military approaches toward domestic insurgency generally do not follow a classic hearts and minds approach. Instead, they normally feature enemy-centric and highly kinetic military operations combined with creative, and often con\u0002troversial, political co-option of selected insurgent groups and group leaders. Third, India’s federal democratic structure often drives domestic counterinsurgency responses that feature uncomfortable political tradeoffs at the local level, state level, and between the state and the national governments. The political mobilization aspect of domestic insurgent groups creates incentives for political parties to harness these groups for their own ends.21 Invariably, this political utility makes them hard to counter in a timely manner and then difficult to address in the face of growing corruption, illegal activities, and often human rights questions as they embed into the political and social space. In general, Indian domestic counterinsurgency has worked for the country out and its distinctive system of governance and its complex national ethnic makeup. India’s approaches have contained, but not eliminated, the three major insurgencies that it has faced since inde\u0002pendence. But for many Westerners, India’s domestic counterinsurgency “successes” can look exceptionally violent and uncomfortably incomplete.22 This divergence in perspectives is im\u0002portant. It indicates why India prefers strict autonomy in the conduct of its domestic counterin\u0002surgent operations, routinely brushing aside the limited offers of direct outside military support that it receives. It also demonstrates why outside partners, including the United States, should realize that if they push too aggressively in offering well-intentioned direct assistance in these areas, they could encounter significant resistance in New Delhi—possible to the point where security cooperation could be dampened in other more important areas of mutual interest. India’s deep past and recent experiences with the Naxalite insurgency demonstrate the wisdom of these conclusions. The Naxalite Insurgency—History and Context: Phases 1 and 2 The Naxalite insurgency started as a communist peasant revolt in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It later evolved into a combination of ethnic-, caste-, and class-based political violence across a number of the poorest provinces in India’s east.23 It became known as Naxalism, or the Naxalite movement, given its late 1950s origins as a Maoist movement struggling for in\u0002dependence in the small village of Naxalbari in the state of West Bengal, along the Indo-Nepal border (see map 1).24 The 1967 Naxalbari uprising against feudal landlords sowed the seeds for insurgency in India.25 8 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 The Naxalites were a group of far-left radical communists who promoted Maoist political sentiment and ideology to fight exploitation by landlords in India’s feudal postcolonial socio\u0002economic system. In this approach, the Naxalites broke from the tradition of Indian communist Map 1. States and Union Territories of India 9 India’s Naxalite Insurgency political participation in the electoral system supplemented by general worker strikes that had been the staple of Communist Party of India activity from the 1920s through the 1950s.26 Dur\u0002ing the 1940s and 1950s, the CPI had become aligned with Moscow in its international leanings, functioning in India mainly as a political party. Around the same time, communism in India split in a third direction, with the CPI-Marxist group taking a more radical approach to its po\u0002litical rhetoric but mainly pursuing its own independent parliamentary path.27 Naxalism is based upon an extremist belief that the Indian government is a semicolonial, feudalistic, and imperial entity that needs to be overthrown. Naxalism’s objective is to seize state power through a protracted armed struggle against big landlords and petty government of\u0002ficials. Naxalism takes up the cause of the marginalized sections of society. It often opposes the implementation of various developmental projects such as construction of roads, rails, schools, and hospitals in affected areas in order to demonstrate to the people the ineffectiveness of the state. When successful, the Naxalite movement has operated in a vacuum created by the absence or collapse of the administrative structure at the local, provincial, or state level.28 The Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. A short review of the first two phases of the Naxalite insurgency establishes its patterns and India’s preferred security framework for dealing with this domestic stability threat. A more detailed review of the third and most noteworthy phase of the Naxalite insurgency follows in a subsequent section. First Phase, 1967–1973 Inspired by Maoist revolutionary tactics and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Naxalite movement gained momentum and began in the late 1960s and 1970s. Initially the movement centered in the Indian states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh (map 1). It featured peasants seizing land by force and then taking up arms to protect themselves against police and landlord response.29 Soon these rural activities merged with politically disillusioned and ideologically driven university students from Kolkata and other urban areas in India’s Far East—with active cells stretching from the state of Bihar in the north to Adhra Pradesh in the south. By 1969 un\u0002der charismatic leader Charu Mazumdar, the Naxalites organized as the CPI–Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) and attempted more centralized and violent tactics.30 CPI-ML moved to organize peasants and seize political power through guerilla warfare while focusing on annihilation of its class enemies.31 In urban areas such as Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), Naxalite insurgents 10 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 targeted police and local constables, attacking police outposts and patrols with an aim to cap\u0002ture weapons.32 Despite some limited weapons assistance and rhetorical support from Mao’s Communist government in the 1960s, China never undertook a strong campaign of support for the Nax\u0002alites.33 The Naxalites remained fragmented and without much training or organization. This first wave of Naxalite violence peaked in 1971 when over 3,650 acts of class-based attacks were reported and more than 850 people were reported killed. But it quickly succumbed to its own weaknesses and a state counterinsurgency response that featured two waves of activity. From the summer of 1969 through the end of 1971, state-led counterinsurgency campaigns against the rural Naxalite cadres decimated much of those insurgency cadres. State police, as\u0002sisted by the CRPF, moved against poorly armed Naxalites with great effect. By 1971 these po\u0002lice forces were joined by army units deployed into West Bengal. It took the failure of local and state police to contain Naxalite insurgents for more than 2 years before the West Bengal deputy chief minister—himself a politician from the CPI-Maoist party—requested assistance from a central paramilitary force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles, to assist state security forces. Then in July and August of 1971 a more dangerous component of the Naxalite insurgency in West Ben\u0002gal’s Birbhum District was put down by a joint campaign led by the army known as Operation Steeplechase. Army involvement only came after the collapse of an Indian National Congress– led coalition government in West Bengal and the New Delhi declaration of “President’s Rule” throughout the region. This made the central government responsible for the fight against the Naxalites and enabled Prime Minister Indira Ghandi to divert elements of the army massing along the East Pakistan border for what would become the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani War that assisted local police in decisive counterinsurgency operations.34 The urban dimension of the first wave of the Naxalite insurgency remained violent throughout 1971 and festered into the next 2 years, even as the rural component succumbed to Operation Steeplechase. Interparty political violence in Kolkata among the INC, CPI-M, and CPI-ML led to a swirl of assassinations and attacks against security forces and political leaders across urban areas. The election of a new West Bengal chief minister from the INC in March 1972 turned the tide on the urban Naxals. The law and order platform of Chief Minister Sid\u0002dharth Shankar Ray played out in a much more muscular police role across Kolkata and its surroundings throughout mid-1972 and into mid-1973. Kolkata police apprehended Naxalite leader Charu Maumdar in July 1972, and he died in custody several weeks later. Naxalite lead\u0002ers across the city succumbed to increasing police and state paramilitary presence. By 1973 the main cadres of the Naxalites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars.35 11 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In this first Naxalite insurgent phase, the national government followed a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent phases. It did not forcibly intervene in the beginning. In keep\u0002ing with the federalist framework of the constitution, the government in New Delhi left it to local and state officials in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and other afflicted states to take their own security actions to stop the threat. In the late 1960s, these state and local responses were often inadequate and ineffective.36 The central government only engaged with security forces once it had a critical mass of army forces in the region for the 1971–1972 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh and when the President’s Rule special authorities were in place, which enabled the military the power to make preventative arrests, search premises without a warrant, and shoot to kill civilians. Once engaged, the slowly evolving national response became one featuring intense force and coercion, eradicating the violence without eliminating the insurgency’s socio\u0002economic preconditions. Second Phase, 1977–1994 India’s first wave of insurgent violence ended badly for this domestic left-wing extremist movement but did not eliminate the conditions inspiring the movement or all of those willing to hold to the Naxalite cause. The movement fractured into more than 40 separate small groups.37 Slowly—over the course of a decade—these groups began to remobilize and consolidate. Par\u0002ticularly in the southeastern Indian state of Adhra Pradesh, a new Naxalite organization called People’s War emerged. Its leader, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, sought a more efficient structure to boost morale, recruitment, and funding. By 1978 Naxalite peasant revolts had spread to the Karimnagar District of Telangana and Adilabad District of Adhra Pradesh. The major grievance was unpaid wages. Second-wave Naxalite insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early 1980s insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked North Telangana village and Dan\u0002dakaranya forests areas along the Adhra Pradesh and Orissa border.38 In 1985 Naxalite insurgents began ambushing police. After they killed a police sub-inspec\u0002tor in Warangal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh responded by creating a special task force called the Greyhounds to establish control in the seven worst affected districts. An elite anti-Naxalite commando unit that still exists today, the Greyhounds were drawn from within the Andhra Pradesh police forces and given special treatment. A 2,000-strong force in 2015, the Grey\u0002hounds were given preferred payment and training—better than federal or state paramilitary forces. They were also highly supported by the entire state police force. The Greyhounds played a minimal role in combatting the Naxalites during the second phase of the Maoist insurgency.39 12 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In 1987 the Naxalite political party (People’s War) and other Maoist groups in Andhra Pradesh were barred from elections after kidnapped government officials were exchanged for Naxalite prisoners. The ban was briefly lifted in 1991. In December of that year, however, insur\u0002gent attacks increased. Affected states responded by establishing special laws that enabled police to focus on capture, detention, and extra-normal means of violence against Naxalite cadres— fighters and presumed supporters.40 Adhra Pradesh and Orissa invited additional central para\u0002military forces in Telangana to augment state and federal government security forces already there. Besides brute force, the state set up rival mass organizations to attract youth away from the Naxalites, started rehabilitation programs, and established new informant networks.41 The new counterinsurgency strategy reduced violent incidents, and nearly 9,000 Naxalites surrendered. Consequently in 1994 the ban on ostensibly moderate Naxalite political parties was lifted.42 The second wave of the Naxalite insurgency had been stopped. However, and as at the end of the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency, the socioeconomic conditions underpin\u0002ning Naxalism remained largely unchanged in many regions of eastern India. Third Phase, 2004–2015 From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s the Naxalite insurgency remained largely out of the public eye, but the movement had not gone away. Taking advantage of rising local support for violent response to economic conditions, fragmented Naxalite groups created a united front: the People’s War, Party Unity, and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) combined to form the People’s War Group (PWG). Naxalism manifested itself in episodic spurts of violence by the PWG, which had its most pronounced presence in Adhra Pradesh. From 1999–2002, local level violence increased. The PWG accelerated attacks on state government locations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. By 2000 an estimated 3,000 armed Naxalite rebels were re\u0002portedly active in India’s east.43 During this time, Indian government agencies took actions that accelerated grievances among the poor and displaced with sympathies for left-wing violence. First, economic growth and development led to local and state government appropriation of land for infrastructure and resource development, displacing many underprivileged people who had no political voice. Second, governments responded to Naxalite violence with acute violence, reportedly includ\u0002ing the extra-judicial murder and torture of suspected rebels and rebel families.44 The MCC intensified its campaign of violence against Indian security forces and government agencies in 2002–2003 after its leader was killed by police.45 13 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In 2004, the PWG was superseded by the CPI-M.46 From this 2004 merger of the two larg\u0002est Naxalite factions—the PWG and MCC—into the CPI-M, Maoist ideology was fused with a cadre of armed groups for the first time.47 A third and more lethal wave of violence—more sophisticated and more destructive—rapidly spread throughout eastern India. Naxalite leaders expanded control over natural resource rich areas (for example, coal, gas, precious minerals, and timber). They also collected taxes and extortion money to fund weapons production, including the production of crude but effective improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Estimates from 2004 to 2011 suggest the Naxalites extracted at least $18.4 million annually from government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.They embarked upon more choreographed terror campaigns including the murder of local politicians, overwhelming attacks on local police sta\u0002tions, impressment of child soldiers, and a general campaign to scare away outside investors. By the second half of 2005, Naxalites demonstrated a lethality and reach far beyond the capacity of other domestic terrorist and insurgent groups. They destroyed buildings, captured weapons, and killed several local policemen in an attack on a village in Uttar Pradesh. They also attacked the Jehanabad Prison in Bihar, killing two, freeing more than 300 inmates, and abduct\u0002ing about 30 inmates who were members of an anti-Naxalite group. Total deaths from Naxalite\u0002attributed insurgency and terrorism grew to more than 800 in the impacted east and north\u0002eastern regions.48 In 2006 and 2007, this trend expanded. In 2006, Naxalite groups launched several high-profile attacks against civilians and security forces, expanding the rural territory under Maoist control and under threat of extreme violence. In one event, an attack by some 800 armed Naxalites in Chhattisgarh killed 25, injured 80 more, and saw some 250 people declared missing.49 In 2006, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh grew concerned about the mounting threat posed by Naxalite groups to internal stability and democratic traditions across the east and southeast of India. The Naxalite menace had grown such that 18 of India’s federal states and 194 of its total districts were effected by Naxalite violence. For the first time Prime Minister Singh called the Naxalite/Maoist insurgency and associated terrorism “the sin\u0002gle biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”50 In 2007 Naxalite and Maoist violence reached an apex where it would remain for the next 4 years through 2010 (see map 2). Over 971 Naxalite attacks were recorded in the first seven months of 2007. That number would grow to over 1,500 attacks by the end of the year (see table51). Left-wing extremists began target\u0002ing elected officials including a member of the Indian parliament from Jharkhand state and the son of a former chief minister (or governor) of Andhra Pradesh.52 By 2010 the Naxalites were active in nine Indian states and reported to have a strong foot\u0002hold in parts of seven: West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, 14 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 and Maharashtra. This region happened to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric power potential. Across these states there were more than 2,200 incidents of Naxalite violence and almost 1,200 killed in 2010 alone (table).53 Map 2. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2007 15 India’s Naxalite Insurgency The threat to Indian national interests became obvious to the federal government and more co\u0002ordinated actions followed. From 2005 through 2010, Naxalite violence and the insufficient state-led, federally sup\u0002ported efforts to counter it cost India an average of more than 700 deaths per year. Most of these individuals were classified as civilian (see appendix A). Recruited from the disaffected rural poor, Naxalite cadres grew by 2010 to an estimated 20,000 armed fighters and an additional 50,000 supporters.54 In 2010, as he had first done in 2006, Prime Minister Singh trumpeted the risks of Naxalite violence to the stability and the ever important economic growth for the country. In May of that year, Prime Minister Singh referred to Naxalism as the “biggest internal security challenge” India has ever faced.55 The national government was understandably frustrated. From January to June 2009, India witnessed over 1,100 Naxalite-generated incidents of violence. These would double by the end of 2009 (table). Major violence occurred during national elections held from April to May 2009 as Naxalites called for an election boycott, attacked polling places, set off land mines, and even took control of a region of West Bengal known as Lalgarh. Paramilitary and police response operations against Naxalite locations were largely unsuccessful.56 Naxalite atrocities gained national notoriety. But simultaneously, accusations of systematic local police brutality and local and federal police human rights abuses against innocent civilians grew more vocal throughout the affected zones.57 In 2010 Naxalite violence inflicted 9 separate states of India and over 200 individual districts.58 Year 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 All Incidents 1,088 1,091 1,136 1,415 1,760 2,212 2,258 1,591 1,565 1,509 1,608 1,533 Attacks on Police 118 155 143 135 131 230 250 192 N/A 210 194 N/A Total Deaths 251 280 376 321 532 1,138 907 648 650 685 846 636 N/A = specific data not available Sources: “Left Wing Extremist (LWE) Data,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of Naxal Violence During 2008 to 2012,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of LWE Violence During 2011 to 2016 (up to 31.03.2016),” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs, “Annual Reports,” available at. Table. Major Incidents During Naxalite Insurgency, Third Phase 16 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In March 2010, after months of prevarication and confusion, the national government launched Operation Green Hunt. The initiative added an additional estimated 20,000 federal paramilitary troops, mainly from the CRPF battalions, to existing state, local, and already pres\u0002ent Ministry of Home Affairs forces from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Forc\u0002es, and Shashastra Seema Bal.59 (See appendix B for detail on MHA special police units.) The operation sent federal, state, and local police and paramilitary forces into former no-go zones deep in the forests of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states to rid them of militants, but these operations struggled. In April 2010, Naxalite insurgents ambushed 80 troops of the Indian Cen\u0002tral Police Security Forces (CPSF) in Chhattisgarh, killing an estimated 75 in the worst attack on Indian security forces since the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency began.60 In February 2011 Naxalites kidnapped two Indian government officials, demanding a halt to Green Hunt. The government agreed. The Naxalites also demanded the release of seven top imprisoned lead\u0002ers in exchange for the two officials. After a May 2011 Naxalite attack, 10 bodies of policemen were found dismembered in dense forest.61 Despite the major setbacks of 2010–2011, Indian federal and state authorities made some headway against a Naxalite insurgency now generating international headlines.62 Better coordi\u0002nated joint federal-state anti-Naxalite security operations killed a prominent Naxalite military leader, Koteswara Rao, in a November 2011 operation. In 2012 government paramilitary and police operations in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh began to produce results, with more than 1,800 Naxalite insurgents reported arrested and another 440 surrendered during the year.63 In late 2012 several Naxalite regional military leaders were captured and killed in those provinces. Acts of extreme violence continued during 2012 and 2013, but the expanse of the insur\u0002gency began to abate. Insurgency-related fatalities declined in 2012 and remained below 400 in 2013 (table). West Bengal reported sharp declines in Naxalite presence and activities dur\u0002ing 2013, although some observers declared that the decline in those states was offset by a corresponding increase of Naxalite violence in neighboring states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (appendix A). The Naxalites began the practice of including booby-trapping the bodies of dead Indian soldiers with IEDs in their stomachs. They killed national Congressman, and an\u0002ti-Naxalite militia Salwa Judum founder, Mahendra Karma in an attack on his convoy while he was campaigning for election in rural Chhattisgarh communities. Prime Minister Singh called for a two-pronged approach to dismantle the Naxalite network: sustaining joint and proactive military operations with greater economic development and responsible governance programs in the areas with strongest Maoist support. The CRPF successfully launched a 5-day interstate offensive in late December 2013 to dismantle core Maoist groups.64 It shut down a gun manu- 17 India’s Naxalite Insurgency facturing factory and recovered numerous weapons and explosives. Remote triggering devices were also found, indicating that the insurgency was using more advanced weaponry. By 2014 fatalities from Naxalite violence dropped below 300 for the first time in more than a decade (table). Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh remained most affected by the violence, and some Naxalite groups conducted operations and expanded into southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka states. But a review of the map in 2013 of Naxalite-impacted areas revealed a significant drop in the overall number of affected districts since 2007—from 165 to 120 overall—and an even more significant drop in districts categorized as experiencing severe or moderate amounts of violence from Naxalite activities over the same period—from 69 dis\u0002tricts in 2007 to just 28 in 2013 (see map 3). Eighty percent of Naxalite violence now afflicted only three states of India, down from the nine states impacted by serious Naxalite violence in 2010. On balance the tide had turned. By the end of 2014 the Naxalite insurgency was down if not out.65 In 2015, Indian joint security and economic efforts to counter the remaining Naxalite threat focused on 30 key districts in these 3 most impacted states, enabling more concentrated efforts matching gradually applied paramilitary enforcement with legal reforms and develop\u0002ment activities.66 As in the first two waves of Naxalite insurgency, the Indian federal-state government dis\u0002connect hampered its counterinsurgency efforts throughout the 2000s. Under the Indian con\u0002stitution, states bear the responsibility for enforcing law and order. When required, however, the federal government can send police and—under more limited conditions—military troops. In the case of federal police, assistance can come only upon request from the state government. In the case of military troops, assistance can come in the event of a state of emergency declara\u0002tion—as during the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency. Throughout the period from 2000 to 2010, the federal and state home (interior) ministries supervised multiple police and intelligence agencies without much unity of effort or command. An operation against Naxalite groups in the state of Bihar early in the 2000s faltered. Federal paramilitary border security forces in seven districts helped the local police, and millions of ru\u0002pees were promised in economic development opportunities. But the economic promises were broken, and poorly coordinated security operations only further alienated Naxalite moderates, derailing hoped for results by early 2002. In advance of 2004 elections in Chhattisgarh, the fed\u0002eral government sent 180 companies of paramilitary forces armed with helicopters and other advanced equipment. The Naxalites disappeared. Once the elections were over, federal troops and equipment departed and the Naxalites returned. 18 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 From the 2004 merger of Naxalite groups, the Indian government, particularly at the federal level, applied both carrots and sticks, incentivizing insurgents to pick constitutional remedies and brutally punishing those who refused. But the splits between state and federal authorities limited effectiveness. In part, state and local governments saw themselves in a co\u0002nundrum; they wanted an end to the organized Naxalite violence targeting them, their infra\u0002Map 3. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2013 19 India’s Naxalite Insurgency structure, and their legal enforcement structure. However, they did not want to alienate the vote banks across their states who sympathized with the Naxalite view of economic injustice but did not actively participate in violence. In one notable but far from unique instance, the chief minister (or governor) of the Naxalite-wracked state of Jharkhand won election in 2009 with strong insurgent sympathizer and insurgent vote bank support.67 State-level leaders de\u0002sired greater economic support from the central government, not overwhelming force, as the primary means to redress deeply held communist sympathies in their vote constituencies. Na\u0002tional political leaders within the INC empathized with these state-level concerns, offering some economic support and some additional policing support—but too little of either to make significant headway prior to 2010–2011. The politics of left-wing issues and voter concerns made effective coordination of counterinsurgency versus the Naxalites difficult. It took the extensive violence and loss of life between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate the failure of an ill-coordinated approach. In 2009 the central government signaled that it wanted to provide 80,000 paramilitary and federal police to help in the fight, but these were too slowly fed into the region without strong local coordination. From the desperation of the peak year of Naxalite (CPI-Maoist) violence in 2010, and then–Prime Minister Singh’s second declaration that Maoist violence was India’s most grave internal security threat, a combination of state\u0002level requests and federal-level policy improvements paved the way for late-arriving successes against the Naxalites.68 The path to success was also paved by corresponding Naxalite failures. Beginning in 2010, the Indian federal government finally undertook several successful ini\u0002tiatives that slowly but steadily spanned the coordination gap between federal and state security forces and linked with improved local economic development aid.69 First, the government took steps to increase the costs to Maoist insurgent group operations—both financial and physical. Second, the central government deployed an additional 66 federal paramilitary security battal\u0002ions, CPSF and others, into the field where the insurgency had been winning against small and poorly trained local police. As noted above, these came slowly and in tranches between 2010 and 2014 but reached an impressive number of more than 200,000 by early 2014.70 India’s mili\u0002tary and its special operations forces (SOF) have not participated directly in the third phase of Naxalite counterinsurgency operations. Instead, SOF units have provided indirect assistance— offering specialized training to Indian Central Armed Police Forces (see appendix B) preparing to deploy to the anti-Maoist counterinsurgency fight.71 Third, the federal government built 444 new police stations in affected areas and regenerated the policing capability in them.72 Fourth, the government established a civil development program in the worst affected areas. Finally, government security forces worked more effectively in a combined action environment where 20 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 economic development and human rights were established in the communities most vulnerable to Naxalite recruiting and propaganda.73 These five national factors interacted with several organizational failures by the Naxalites themselves. First, the Maoists failed to generate a message of systematic economic exploitation to the degree necessary for serious attention in Indian urban areas, where the gulf between rich and poor was great and growing every year. Second, despite their highly publicized violence, the Naxalites never won the “mindspace” in India; the Maoist ideology of class conflict gener\u0002ated limited appeal outside of primitive and tribal areas in India, never resonating in urban ar\u0002eas other than with a marginalized group of activist university students.74 Indian youth moved onto other causes and other areas of activism in the wider Indian economy.75 Third, Naxalites proved to be their own worst enemies. They often splintered into criminal syndicates deal\u0002ing narcotics and running both extortion and kidnapping rackets. This profiteering, evident from as early as 2009–2010, revealed that Naxalism was less about communist ideology or well-coordinated violent insurgent activity and much more about local and regional organized criminal activity, which exploits rather than benefits the lower class (and lower caste) Indian Hindus who live there.76 In self-reflective statements, ministry-level officials in the Indian federal government ac\u0002knowledged that most Naxalite gains before 2010 had come too often because local govern\u0002ments and security officials incorrectly assessed and mishandled the problems of the disgrun\u0002tled Indian minority groups in rural areas. At the same time the central government remained tepid in its involvement—unable to induce state governments to request more assertive federal security assistance and caught in a political conundrum where some of the state government leadership was both courting Naxalite sympathizer votes while simultaneously fighting Naxalite militant cadres. Once the federal government got serious and increased paramilitary security presence with a wider number of local economic development programs, the Naxalites began to wane.77 Attention to a holistic approach by the Indian central government caused the worst of the Naxalite insurgency to recede in a visible manner.78 In 2016 the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India remains a security factor, but one far from the menace publicly announced by then–Prime Minister Singh in 2006 and again in 2010.79 Instead it is now much more of a nuisance, largely a constellation of organized criminal enter\u0002prises with a loose affiliation to a Maoist credo than an ideological insurgency. The socioeco\u0002nomic factors that inspire Naxalite groups remain in place, and this insurgency could again evolve into a more serious threat to local security agents in India. In the poor eastern districts of India, the possibility of a fourth wave of Naxalite insurgency cannot be dismissed if the rich 21 India’s Naxalite Insurgency continue to get richer without the benefits of economic growth filtering down to the people who really need it.80 India’s long slog toward corralling the third phase of its Naxalite insurgency again demon\u0002strated the challenges and strengths of its counterinsurgency framework. State and local govern\u0002ment police forces must fail obviously and admit to their failures before major federal assistance can come forward. Left-wing (or communist) inspired violence mixes awkwardly with Indian electoral politics in many eastern states of the country. Communist political party voters often sympathize with Naxalite grievances but not their violent means. State and local officials thus have incentives to take uncertain and indecisive action with their police and security forces. Too often, they can tolerate incompetence and even human rights abuses by local-level counterin\u0002surgency police and militias, exacerbating wider grievances. They appeal for national economic help while avoiding national security help out of a fear that too much outside intervention might harm their local political interests. Federal-level forces, when these do arrive, come with their own issues. They can lack local knowledge and fail to be sensitive to popular culture and traditions. This leaves them vulnerable to insurgent ambush and to charges of torture or human rights abuses from an uncertain or frightened local population. U.S. Security Engagement with Indian Ministry of Home Affairs U.S. engagement with India in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has developed over a 16-year period from January 2000. This engagement has advanced along three parallel lines of interaction. One line has been through bilateral dialogue and exercises between U.S. and Indian SOF, which have focused on counterterrorism training events and conversa\u0002tions. A second line has been through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This collaboration has focused on criminal investigative techniques; port, rail, and maritime security training and best practices; and a general growth in liaison and information exchange between respective special police and border security agencies. A third line of interaction has evolved in more general bilateral military-to-military exchanges between the national armies, navies, air forces, and coast guards. Advancements in each of these areas have been noteworthy but not comprehensive. For all the noteworthy advances, limitations have remained, especially when it comes to the matter of outside assistance for Indian units and organizations conducting domestic counterinsurgency. The history of special operations training and exercising is most noteworthy. Bilateral U.S.- Indian SOF have undertaken joint exercises that work on interoperability in counterterror\u0002ism and counterinsurgency operation skills and drills. Small-scale counterterrorism training 22 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 exercises have been conducted on a recurring basis since 2002, including exercises in India’s northeast territories where longstanding domestic insurgencies continue.81 Under the broad definition of U.S.-India maritime security cooperation, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) SOF also have been training Indian military special forces officers in counterterrorism, learning from Indian counterterrorism experiences at the same time. In the main, these exercises have focused upon special techniques and capabilities for SOF activities in counterterrorism opera\u0002tions (see appendix C). Despite a decade of offers by U.S. senior commanders and defense officials, Indian leaders declined to have U.S. SOF engage with or provide direct assistance to the MHA paramilitary and police forces optimized for domestic counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations.82 But in October 2015, India, for the first time, welcomed U.S. SOF to a joint training exercise with its MHA counterterrorism unit, the National Security Guards (NSG).83 This was a meaningful step forward and, as most observers believe, became possible only after the change in perspective ac\u0002companying the government of Prime Minister Modi. Yet the limit of U.S. SOF interaction with that of only the NSG—the single special police unit focused on counterterrorism rather than counterinsurgency operations—is telling. After more than a decade of U.S. offers, the Indian government still remains uncomfortable about direct bilateral counterinsurgency training with its large array of MHA domestic counterinsurgency forces. Washington and New Delhi first established the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Work\u0002ing Group (JWG) in January 2000. Among more than a dozen major steps, the United States and India initiated antiterrorism training programs for Indian law enforcement officials and began a dialogue on cooperation in homeland and internal security.84 First, these programs involved lim\u0002ited military-to-military counterterrorism engagements. Then, after the November 2008 Mum\u0002bai terrorist attack, a more formal set of interactions between DHS and MHA counterterrorism and law enforcement officials began to take shape. Notably, however, neither of these lines of engagement have witnessed the MHA welcoming direct U.S. military or special police assistance for its special police or border police engaged in combating the Naxalite insurgency. In September 2005, USPACOM conducted a counterterrorism tabletop exercise that brought together Indian and American military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitari\u0002an assistance leaders. A U.S. National Guard unit co-trained with Indian troops at India’s Coun\u0002ter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram. U.S. antiterrorism assistance advanced again after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the commercial district of Mumbai. The U.S. Department of State’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) provided enhanced training 23 India’s Naxalite Insurgency consultations with senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials on the topics of hotel security, rail security, responses to an active shooter incident, as well as major event security management.85 In 2010, the two governments began the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Since then the dialogue has enabled bilateral cooperation on mutual strategic interests and strengthened “security cooperation through expanded dialogues and exercises as well as shar\u0002ing of advanced technologies.”86 A subsequent 2010 U.S.-India Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative allows the United States to facilitate capacity-building and training in India across a number of specific areas, including but not limited to: ■ developing investigative skills ■ promoting cooperation between forensic science laboratories ■ establishing procedures to provide mutual investigative assistance ■ improving capabilities to act against money-laundering, counterfeit currency, and terrorist financing ■ trading best practices on mass transit and rail security ■ increasing interactions between coast guards and navies on maritime security ■ exchanging experience and expertise on port and border security ■ enhancing liaison and training between specialist counterterrorism units, including the National Security Guard and its U.S. counterparts.87 Beginning in February 2012, American trainers under the ATA have been training Indian police in cooperation with the MHA. This training includes forensic examination of terrorist crime scenes and advanced explosives incident countermeasures. These courses are also available to state police, for example, in Kolkata (West Bengal). Intelligence agencies of both countries are sharing resources to support specific counterterrorism operations.88 These training courses have had a positive impact upon hundreds of Indian local and national police, including IPS. They have also engaged some members of the MHA special police units such as the Indo-Tibetan Bor\u0002der Police and CPSF. Noteworthy and prudent, these bits of individual training have occurred 24 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 with individual Indian police and paramilitary officers and jawans (junior paramilitary soldiers) who have later participated in counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites and other rebel groups.89 At the same time, though, direct U.S. military engagement with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and security forces units involved in domestic counterinsurgency has remained limited. American military interactions with regular Indian army units also have grown in an im\u0002pressive manner over the past decade. As discussed earlier, Indian, just as American, military and defense leaders are keen to state that India has more joint military training events and exer\u0002cises with the United States than with any other defense partner worldwide.90 Yet India’s civilian defense establishment leadership appears amenable to many military-to-military training and exercise interactions with the United States but continues to view access to military technology to be the litmus test of fruitful bilateral defense relations.91 Although the Indian military highly prizes joint service-to-service interactions and exer\u0002cises, no U.S. military units have been engaged with or even indirectly assisted Indian central police or paramilitary units directly involved in the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the Naxalites. In those instances in which the U.S. military and DHS per\u0002sonnel have had interaction with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and paramilitary forces, the rule has been that indirect general skills training is acceptable for Indian leadership, but specific engagement and activities directly with Indian domestic insurgency forces is alto\u0002gether something else. Some analysts have recommended that the United States formally inject direct domestic counterinsurgency assistance into the U.S.-India security relationship. In 2013, one such ana\u0002lyst, Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, made a robust proposal, stating that the United States should formally generate a $400 million India counterinsurgency initiative, jointly run by the Depart\u0002ment of Defense (DOD), State, and DHS.92 He proposed that this initiative should bundle to\u0002gether the indirect assistance provided by the ATA and DOD International Military Education and Training program, as well as establish a Foreign Military Finance Account for India (where one then did not exist) and apportion other money into DHS and Justice department accounts to better enable Federal Bureau of Information resources for its India-focused international po\u0002lice training program. In this well-intentioned recommendation, U.S. largesse could be used to provide vital equipment to India’s CRPF, including armored personnel vehicles, mine-resistant vehicles, flak jackets, GPS trackers, and night-vision goggles. As Indian attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deemed vital for providing counterinsurgency ground 25 India’s Naxalite Insurgency support, this proposal provided for U.S. funding to assist the Indian air force in creating dedi\u0002cated air surveillance and support for the CRPF—including helicopter and UAV support.93 Noble in intent, Mullick’s recommendation of a major U.S. push to provide direct assis\u0002tance to Indian domestic counterinsurgency units and operations remains as misguided today as it was in 2013. Likewise, periodic offers by U.S. defense officials of direct U.S. military assis\u0002tance to Indian counterinsurgency forces are similarly well intentioned but off target.94 These and similar initiatives ultimately push unhelpfully against Indian protection of its absolute sov\u0002ereignty in domestic counterinsurgency operations. Moreover, even if India were to unexpect\u0002edly welcome direct U.S. military and whole-of-government support for its domestic counter\u0002insurgency activities, that very success would create significant problems for the growing but delicate U.S.-India security relationship. These problems are evident in the patterns observed during Indian counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites. Direct American support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations (such as those against the Naxalites) would quickly expose significant divergence between views in Washington and Indian cultural and political concerns with its domestic insurgents. First, In\u0002dians are historically tolerant of long, protracted counterinsurgency operations, including the four-and-a-half-decade Naxalite rebellion, a six-decade swirl of insurgency in northeast India, and the insurgency and rebellion extant in Jammu and Kashmir since 1947. American patience with such protracted counterinsurgency operations has not been a hallmark of its international ventures over the past century. Second, Indian domestic insurgencies have a political cadence and rhythm about them that is alien to American sensibilities. In all three phases of the Naxalite insurgency, state and local political dynamics played to Naxalite sympathizer vote banks, allowing insurgent activi\u0002ties to grow to an uncomfortable level. In the second phase and especially the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency, Indian national police and paramilitary assistance began with limited but targeted security help for local authorities that focused upon managing major events—like election security—but then quickly vanished. Only when the political calculus of local, state, and national officials aligned did coordinated and effective policing, paramilitary, and local as\u0002sistance programs come together. American patience with the dynamics of this Indian political rhythm would be sorely tried. Third, with much of India’s Naxalite insurgency featuring organized criminal activity as its underpinning by 2014–2016, it is arguably more useful and feasible for the United States and India to focus meaningful collaboration on individual policing techniques and investigative activities to counter these dimensions of residual Naxalism. There will be less Indian resistance 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 to this kind of DHS-to-MHA support. Thereafter, the focus of the U.S. military and its SOF can then better orient on wider regional and international counterterrorism activities. In addition to these historically supported cautions, direct American training and equip\u0002ment support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations might run afoul of U.S. legisla\u0002tive mandates and human rights standards. All U.S. assistance to foreign security forces must conform to what is known as the Leahy Law, named for legislative author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). One part of the law applies to State Department foreign assistance programs and the second applies to DOD training and assistance programs for the security forces of a foreign country. Both versions prohibit any U.S. security assistance if the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense have credible information that a military, paramilitary, or police unit of a foreign government has committed a gross violation of human rights in the conduct of its activities— past or present. The law allows for an exception (or waiver) permitting resumption of security assistance if the Secretary of State or Defense reports to Congress that the government of the assisted country is taking effective steps to bring the violating members of the security forces to justice.95 Direct U.S. assistance to India’s paramilitary and police units combatting the Naxalite insurgency (as others) could quickly run into a problem with the Leahy Law. There have been frequent reports of Indian local police units’ involvement in human rights violations against innocents in the Naxalite insurgency areas.96 Indian central policy forces, including units from the CRPF, have been accused of human rights abuses and torture against apprehended militants and presumed supporters in Naxalite-afflicted areas.97 It is hard to imagine Indian pride react\u0002ing well to American demands for certification of the human rights corrections made on its national counterinsurgency paramilitary forces. It also is hard to imagine the U.S.-India security relationship holding up well if, in order to secure training and equipment for its already well-supported national paramilitary units, New Delhi must face repetitive Leahy Law inquiries. Indeed, in a country with growing wealth and a proud belief in the relative successes of its autonomous, indigenous paramilitary counterin\u0002surgency forces, U.S. direct assistance (with strings) is not likely to be well received.98 At the least, such conditioned assistance would strain security relations that both sides desire to see improve. At the worst, the outcome might set back bilateral security progress on far more im\u0002portant U.S.-India security initiatives including those involving joint maritime security activi\u0002ties in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence sharing and broader operations. 27 India’s Naxalite Insurgency Lessons Learned and Policy Implications for U.S.-India Relations A review of the history of Indian approach to dealing with its Naxalite insurgency indi\u0002cates the unique nature of New Delhi’s approach to domestic security. The limited engagement with the United States on military and security assistance offers also indicates the continuing barriers inhibiting a deep and unbridled bilateral security alliance at this time. A decade of U.S. interaction with India on the Naxalite insurgency reinforces the notion that Washington should not expect New Delhi to become a tightly coupled military ally anytime soon. Instead, New Del\u0002hi is more likely to be a friendly strategic partner with the United States where mutual security interests align, while interacting more often in a restrained and limited manner where U.S. and Indian security interests and prerogatives do not well align—as in the case of the Naxalites.99 Given this insight, U.S. policymakers should focus on bilateral counterterrorism and coun\u0002terinsurgency security cooperation efforts toward externally sponsored Islamist terrorist groups and, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, against actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns. As a complement, U.S. military assistance programs focusing on technical skills and practices for individual Indian police, paramilitary, and SOF will remain most promising and prominent for the foreseeable future. 28 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Appendix A.

Under the reciprocal agreement, both New Delhi and Washington would have the ability, but not the obligation, to assist each other’s armed forces with simple military logistics. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India.

On May 22, there were nearly simultaneous bombings of two movie theaters in New Delhi by a Sikh terrorist organization, Babbar Khalsa International, which many thought was defunct. The attacks left 1 person dead and more than 60 injured. On October 29, a series of explosions in crowded marketplaces and on a public bus in New Delhi killed approximately 60 and injured more than 150 on the eve of Diwali, India’s most important Hindu holiday. The Indian government blamed the designated foreign terrorist organiza\u0002tion Lashkar e-Tayyiba for the attack.

While the incident occurred earlier, the attribution was made public this May. **May 2025:** Russian hackers conducted an espionage campaign against educational, government, and research-related entities in Tajikistan. The hackers reportedly used an HTML application to implant file-based malware. **May 2025:** A Turkish espionage group exploited a vulnerability in a messaging app to spy on Kurdish military forces operating in Iraq over the last year. The hackers used a zero-day bug in the applications to gain access to Kurdish military messages. **May 2025:** The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Center named China as the dominant threat to national cybersecurity after a series of hacks and breaches involving British government departments and critical infrastructure, including alleged attacks against the Electoral Commission and Members of Parliament. **May 2025:** The United States, Britain, France, Germany, and other allies issued an advisory warning of a Russian cyber campaign targeting the delivery of defense support to Ukraine and other NATO defense and tech sectors. **April 2025:** Algeria-linked hackers launched a cyberattack against Morocco's National Social Security Fund, leaking sensitive data online. The breach reportedly exposed personal and financial details for nearly two million people from roughly 500,000 companies. **April 2025:** Hackers spied on the emails of roughly 103 U.S. bank regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for over a year, ending in early 2025. The attackers gained access via a compromised administrator account, accessing roughly 150,000 emails containing highly sensitive financial institution data. The hacks have yet to be attributed. **April 2025:** U.S. Cyber Command discovered Chinese malware implanted on partner networks in multiple Latin American nations during a series of 'hunt forward' operations, according to Lt. Gen.

The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

    "title": "Weaponizing Markets: India’s Naxalite Insurgency",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future.

Today's spy doesn't wear a trench coat or sneak across borders — they slip into servers. A few lines of malicious code, a cleverly worded phishing email, and one careless click are enough to open a backdoor into power grids, defence networks, or corporate vaults. There's no gunfire, no alarm — just a silent invasion across cyberspace.Modern espionage no longer focuses on state secrets alone. It can paralyse ports, jam telecoms, empty bank accounts, and hold critical infrastructure hostage, all from thousands of miles away. Many of these attacks aren't random pranks but well-coordinated operations by advanced persistent threats (APTs) — hacker groups often backed by nation-states who monitor systems for months and even years — or by ‘Spider gangs', the global cybercrime cartels who chase profit, not politics.In Feb 2025, a hacker collective calling itself ‘Keymous+' targeted Gujarat's civic systems, according to FalconFeeds.io, a threat actor repository. The group overwhelmed the websites of Ahmedabad and Surat municipal corporations with fake web traffic in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that crashed the portals for hours. Analysts found that Keymous+ boasted of 700 global attacks in 2025, 27.6% of which were govt entities while the rest ranged from finance and telecom to education. **You Can Also Check: [Ahmedabad AQI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-aqi-level-air-quality-index-today/3252) \\| [Weather in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-weather-forecast-today/380001) \\| [Gold Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/gold-rates-today/gold-price-in-ahemadabad) \\| [Silver Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/silver-rates-today/silver-price-in-ahemadabad)** But others aimed far deeper. In 2020, RedEcho, a group suspected to be backed by a nation-state, infiltrated India's power grid. They did not cause blackouts, but mapped out critical systems like the regional and state load despatch centres (RLDCs and SLDCs) — the nerve centres managing electricity supply — in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and several northern states. Cybersecurity experts at Recorded Future's Insikt group believe the hackers were creating digital \"backdoors\" — hidden entry points — \"to cause potential blackouts in the future\".Then came, TAG-38, another elite adversary sponsored by an enemy nation. Between Sep 2021 and March 2022, \"they targeted at least seven SLDCs in northern and western India, including areas near sensitive border zones\", states the Inskit group report. They cleverly hid their tracks by using hacked DVRs and IP cameras in Taiwan and South Korea to control their attacks remotely. These groups use advanced tools like ShadowPad (a modular malware that can be customised for different attacks) and remote access trojan (RAT) software that lets hackers control a computer from afar. They often get in through spear phishing — tricking someone into clicking a fake email link — or by exploiting weak spots in websites.India also faces threats from APT36 known as ‘Transparent Tribe', another group backed by an enemy nation and active since 2013. In March and April 2025, they disguised malware as updates on the ‘Pahalgam terror attack' to trick officials into opening infected files. They even created fake ministry of defence websites and used a sneaky trick called ClickFix, where malicious code is copied from a user's clipboard without them knowing.Meanwhile, SideCopy, another group, used fake social media profiles and phishing emails to target India's defence personnel. And APT41, also backed by an enemy nation, has been spying on India's healthcare and tech sectors, while also [hacking](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hacking) for money, even manipulating virtual currencies in online games.To combat such threats, Gujarat's science and technology department issued a circular this year, urging all govt employees to strengthen cyber hygiene. \"Do not share official photos or documents online, and never link work emails to personal apps,\" warned principal secretary Mona Kandhar. Officials were reminded that one careless click can compromise an entire department.The war is invisible, but it is already here. Every click, download, or forwarded file could be the entry point for a breach waiting to happen.

    "full_text": "### Global Power Grid Failure: The Ultimate Test of a Disaster Economy ## The Unthinkable Scenario: A Worldwide Blackout Imagine waking up one morning to find every screen dark, every city silent, and every connection gone. No internet, no phone signal, no electricity — anywhere. Airports grounded. Hospitals dark. Satellites flickering. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the nightmare scenario energy planners call a \\*\\* [global grid failure](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=global+grid+failure&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549)\\*\\*. While localized outages are common, a systemic, cross-continental blackout would be unlike anything humanity has faced. It would disrupt water systems, banking, logistics, and communications in a single, cascading event. Within days, cities would struggle for food, fuel, and medical supplies. Within weeks, society would test the limits of order and survival. As impossible as it sounds, the risk isn’t zero. In an era of cyberwarfare, extreme [solar storms](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=solar+storms+electrical+grid&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), and geopolitical instability, experts are quietly asking a chilling question: What if the grid we depend on — globally — simply went dark? ## How the Power Grid Became the World’s Weakest Link The global electrical system was never designed as one coherent network. It’s a loose patchwork of regional grids — the U.S. Eastern, Western, and ERCOT systems, the European [ENTSO-E network](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=ENTSO-E+network&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), and massive interconnections across Asia. Each operates independently yet relies on the same fragile foundations: transmission lines, transformers, substations, and digital control systems. The more connected the world becomes, the more interdependent and vulnerable these systems grow. A cyberattack on one nation’s control nodes, a geomagnetic storm from the sun, or a chain-reaction equipment failure could disable multiple regions simultaneously. In the 21st century, electricity isn’t just energy — it’s existence. Food, transportation, defense, and finance all depend on uninterrupted power. The more sophisticated the grid, the more catastrophic its absence becomes. ## How a Global Grid Failure Could Happen Energy researchers identify three primary pathways for a worldwide electrical collapse: 1. **Cyberattack on control infrastructure:** The world’s grids are managed by industrial control systems (ICS) and [SCADA software](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=define+SCADA+software&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) — often decades old, insecure, and connected to the internet. Coordinated malware could disable protective relays and trip breakers across continents in seconds. 2. **Solar storm or electromagnetic pulse (EMP):** A strong coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun could induce geomagnetic currents that burn out transformers globally. The [1859 Carrington Event](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=1859+Carrington+Event&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) produced auroras as far south as Cuba — today, that same intensity could cripple satellites and transmission lines for years. 3. **Systemic equipment collapse:** With aging infrastructure, spare parts like high-voltage transformers take months to replace. A simultaneous series of failures across continents could outstrip manufacturing capacity and delay recovery indefinitely. Each scenario is improbable on its own — but together, they represent a plausible convergence risk in an age of climate stress, cyber conflict, and geopolitical fragmentation. ## The Domino Effect: 72 Hours to Chaos Most people underestimate how fast modern life unravels when electricity stops. Within hours, pumps at gas stations, water treatment plants, and supermarkets cease functioning. Hospitals switch to limited backup power. ATMs and credit systems go offline, halting commerce. By the third day, refrigerated food spoils, cell towers die, and transportation grinds to a halt. In dense urban areas, law enforcement becomes overwhelmed as communications fail and panic spreads. PowerPlantMaps’ research into past blackouts — from Texas 2021 to India’s 2012 outage affecting 620 million people — shows that even regional failures can paralyze entire economies. A global outage would multiply those effects a thousandfold. ## The Disaster Industrial Complex: Who Profits When the Lights Go Out? Ironically, every blackout fuels a surge of economic activity. Investors, insurers, and infrastructure firms stand ready to profit from reconstruction. Bloomberg estimates that U.S. disaster-related spending now exceeds \\*\\*$1 trillion annually\\*\\*, much of it directed toward energy restoration and backup systems. In this “ [disaster industrial complex](https://www.disasterreliefmaps.com/2025/10/the-rise-of-americas-disaster-economy.html),” every storm, fire, or grid failure becomes an opportunity — a market built on resilience, but driven by collapse. A global power failure would ignite the largest mobilization of resources in human history: satellite launches, microgrid installations, generator sales, and the reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Companies that build batteries, data centers, and private [microgrids](https://blog.solarenergymaps.com/2025/10/the-rise-of-microgrids-and-energy.html) could emerge as the next trillion-dollar winners. The question isn’t whether there will be profits — but who can survive long enough to earn them. ## What Would You Do Without Power? Preparedness experts categorize survival into five pillars: \\*\\*water, food, heat, communication, and mobility.\\*\\* A global outage would test all five simultaneously. - **Water:** Without electricity, municipal pumping stations fail. Gravity-fed systems run dry within days. Households would need stored water or filtration devices. - **Food:** Refrigeration halts and grocery supply chains collapse. Non-perishable goods and local agriculture become survival essentials. - **Heat and cooling:** In extreme climates, lack of HVAC can turn deadly within hours. Wood, propane, and solar heating become vital. - **Communication:** With no cellular or internet networks, shortwave and ham radios become the only long-range communication tools. - **Mobility:** Electric vehicles, gas pumps, and traffic systems stop. Bicycles and manually operated transport regain value. In essence, a total grid failure would revert modern life to the pre-industrial age — but with 8 billion people unprepared to live that way. ## Mapping the Impact: Where Blackouts Hit Hardest At [PowerPlantMaps.com](https://www.powerplantmaps.com), we use historical outage data to identify regions most vulnerable to cascading grid failures. The top risk clusters include: - **[U.S. Gulf Coast](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=US+Gulf+Coast+power+grid+resilience&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549):** Storm-driven outages and coastal grid fragility. - **Europe’s Rhine Corridor:** Flood-induced substation failures. - **South and East Asia:** Overloaded networks from rapid urbanization. - **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Chronic underinvestment and low redundancy. Visualizing these data layers reveals a pattern: the world’s most industrialized zones are also its most grid-dependent. The more developed the region, the steeper the fall when power vanishes. ## The Hidden Players of the Global Grid Few realize that a handful of corporations control the flow of global electricity hardware: [Siemens](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Siemens+electrical+grid+equipment&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), ABB, Hitachi Energy, General Electric, and Schneider Electric manufacture most of the world’s high-voltage equipment. The supply chains for transformers, capacitors, and relays are so concentrated that a single global event could wipe out production capacity. In that case, rebuilding the world’s grid wouldn’t take months — it could take decades. This concentration of control turns grid resilience into both an engineering and geopolitical issue. ## The Rise of Microgrids and Energy Islands To prepare for the unthinkable, nations and cities are experimenting with \\*\\*microgrids\\*\\* — small, self-sufficient energy networks capable of operating independently from the main grid. Universities, hospitals, military bases, and even island nations are building localized systems powered by solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage. During a global grid crisis, these microgrids could form the backbone of recovery. They represent both a technological safeguard and a commercial gold rush: a new frontier in decentralized energy economics. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates over $50 billion in microgrid investment pipelines through 2030. The disaster industrial complex is already betting that the next generation of “resilience infrastructure” will come from these autonomous systems. ## Cybersecurity: The Invisible Battlefield In a hyperconnected world, power grids are no longer physical assets alone — they’re digital battlegrounds. State-sponsored hackers have targeted energy systems from Ukraine to the U.S. since 2015. A coordinated global cyberstrike could compromise grid stability faster than any storm. Governments and utilities now spend billions annually on cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and backup control centers. Yet even the most secure systems remain vulnerable to insider error, outdated software, and the sheer complexity of interconnected networks. In a global failure scenario, cyber resilience would be as important as physical repair. ## Rebuilding After the Global Blackout If a global power failure occurred, recovery would be uneven. Wealthier nations with manufacturing capacity could restore power in months, while others might remain dark for years. The United Nations and World Bank have already modeled post-catastrophe frameworks for global energy recovery — including emergency grids powered by floating nuclear reactors, airborne solar drones, and modular hydro plants. A global blackout could paradoxically accelerate renewable adoption as nations rebuild from scratch using distributed systems instead of centralized grids. In other words, from collapse could come reinvention — if humanity learns the right lessons. ## Personal and Community Resilience For individuals, preparedness is no longer paranoia; it’s prudence. A small investment in off-grid capacity — solar panels, portable batteries, [manual tools](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=manual+tools+survival&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) — can mean survival in prolonged outages. Communities can organize local power cooperatives, stockpile resources, and create neighborhood emergency protocols. On a larger scale, mapping and data transparency are essential. PowerPlantMaps encourages citizens to document blackouts, share outage data, and contribute to public resilience mapping. Knowledge is the first step toward preparedness. ## The Global Wake-Up Call A global grid failure may seem unlikely, but every regional blackout, cyber breach, or solar flare is a warning sign. Humanity’s greatest invention — the electric grid — is also its Achilles’ heel. The \\*\\*disaster industrial complex\\*\\* profits from repair, but resilience demands prevention. The choice facing governments and corporations is clear: invest now in modernization, or pay exponentially later in reconstruction. The world’s survival isn’t about avoiding the dark — it’s about learning how to rebuild the light.

    "full_text": "### BW Communities # India Faces Highest Ransomware Threat In APJ Region: CrowdStrike Report [BW Online Bureau](javascript:void(0);) Oct 21, 2025 - [\\# Ransomware](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/ransomware) - [\\# India](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/india) - [\\# Cyberattack](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cyberattack) - [\\# Cybersecurity](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cybersecurity) - [\\# APJ](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/apj) Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

Total power generation fell to 142.45 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh), as a rainier-than-usual October lowered demand for cooling and the Diwali festival reduced power demand from industries. “Continued rainfall in most parts of the country compared to last year led to lower demand,” Bhanu Patni, associate director at India Ratings and Research, told Reuters. As a result of subdued demand, power output dropped, with coal-fired generation also falling at the steepest pace since 2020, per the data from grid regulator Grid-India analyzed by Reuters. But India’s renewable energy generation soared by 30.2% from a year earlier to 19.75 billion kWh in October, according to the data. Despite the surge in renewables, coal remains the dominant power-generating source in India accounting for about 60% of total electricity output. India’s annual installations of new coal-fired power capacity [hit 4 gigawatts](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/India-Adds-4GW-of-New-Coal-Power-Capacity-in-2024.html) (GW) in 2024, flat on the five-year high of 2023 and the highest level since 2019, according to official government figures. India plans to add as much as 90 GW of coal capacity by 2032 as it looks to meet its surging power demand with reliable baseload electricity. Despite booming renewable capacity additions, India continues to rely on coal to meet most of its power demand as authorities also look to avoid blackouts in cases of severe heat waves. In July, India [boasted](https://www.pib.gov.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=28) achieving five years ahead of schedule its target to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity coming from non-fossil fuel sources.

Formed from a 1967 split within the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the insurgency has been responsible for decades of violence throughout eastern and central India’s “Red Corridor.” These loosely affiliated Maoist rebels claim to fight on behalf of the landless poor, virulently opposing the injustice and oppression of the Indian state. In response to attacks on police officers, government officials, and landlords, India has employed an assortment of counterinsurgency strategies that, over the years, have met varied levels of success. As the modern Naxalite movement continues to develop, the Indian government faces new complications related to one of its most destabilizing internal security challenges. Adequately addressing this threat will prove essential in solidifying India’s status as a rising world power, as well as demonstrating its capacity to effectively combat militancy. #### Tags [India](https://csis.org/regions/asia/india),[Defense and Security](https://csis.org/topics/defense-and-security), and[Counterterrorism and Homeland Security](https://csis.org/topics/defense-and-security/counterterrorism-and-homeland-security) ### William Magioncalda",

The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. CPI-Maoist and all other Naxal groups are designated as terrorist organizations. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States. The affected States have approached the insurgency with a mixture of policies including negotiation, development programs, and security programs. The Center government has also instituted programs to assist affected states, primarily through funding State programs.

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India \\[CPI\\]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external security partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of domestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an Indian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime security activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington.

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

Some of the most violent attacks conducted by the Naxalites have been against police transport and freight trains, killing dozens of people at a time. The Naxalites specifically inhabit an area known as the \"Red Corridor,\" which stretches from West Bengal state southwest to Karnataka state. The most violent states in this corridor have been Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. The region is defined by rolling hills covered in dense forest and has few improved roads, which allows the Naxalites to control access. The dense foliage also protects them from government aircraft.

(AHMAD SAHEL ARMAN/AFP via Getty Images) By improving ties with the Taliban, India is seeking to reduce security risks, counterbalance Pakistan’s influence and improve economic opportunities in Afghanistan. But this strategy is likely to achieve only modest results because of Afghanistan’s fragile economic and security environment, as well as New Delhi’s enduring ideological and cultural differences with the Taliban. Indian officials recently visited Afghanistan for the first time since the Taliban took control of the country last year. A delegation led by J.P. Singh -- a secretary overseeing India’s external affairs with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran -- traveled to Kabul on June 6 to discuss the delivery of humanitarian aid with Taliban leaders. With the exception of sending such aid and indirectly contacting Afghanistan through third countries, New Delhi had not established a formal dialogue with Kabul since the Taliban seized power in August 2021. The diplomatic visit reflects India’s new policy of engagement with the...

The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, opens new tab when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington to counter China, political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies discriminating against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - aim to benefit all Indians. Rights advocates contest that and point to anti-Muslim hate speeches, opens new tab, the revoking, opens new tab of Muslim-majority Kashmir's special status, a citizenship law, opens new tab that the U.N. calls \"fundamentally discriminatory\" and the demolition of Muslim properties, opens new tab in the name of removing illegal construction. The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups. Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced. Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population. Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan.

(NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

Surrounding the golden fortress city of Jaisalmer in India’s Thar desert, a sea of wind turbines stretches out across the arid landscape as far as the eye can see — visibly marking the world’s third-largest carbon emitter’s green power expansion. Engineers at a 30MW wind farm here operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest clean energy developers, speak with pride about contributing to a national renewable capacity goal of 500GW by 2030. Yet not all of the country’s green power can be dispatched, with the energy grid emerging as a choking constraint. Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew, is confident India will “definitely” achieve its renewable capacity target. “I can see that we’ll get to 500GW, but we won’t be able to exceed it because there’s not enough transmission.” While India boasts one of the world’s largest transmission networks, spanning more than 494,000 circuit kilometres, the grid has not kept pace with the surge in renewable projects. More than 50GW of capacity is stranded, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a US-based think-tank, and JMK Research & Analytics, an Indian cleantech research and consulting firm. © Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images “Transmission has become a critical bottleneck . . . causing rising curtailment and commissioning delays in resource-rich states,” says Jyoti Gulia, founder and chief executive of JMK. Earlier this year, Pralhad Joshi, India’s minister for new and renewable energy, hailed a “Historic Green Leap” after the country reached 50 per cent of its [power capacity from renewables](https://www.ft.com/content/a99a5845-9f50-49a3-8c7c-d704b2cf3b95), now totalling 243GW. Even so, Gulia says, grid expansion delays would “lock in higher coal generation”. Nearly three-quarters of India’s power currently comes from coal, which remains central to meeting its growing electricity demand. This is partly due to fragmented planning between state and central authorities, which largely run India’s grid, as well as mismatched build cycles. Renewable projects can be completed in 12 to 18 months, while transmission lines typically take three to five years. Clean power is also predominantly produced in three states: Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while high demand regions such as Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have little capacity, making cross state delivery critical. “To perfect the timing is impossible,” Ashish Khanna, chief executive of Adani Green Energy — the country’s largest renewable power company — said in September at the Financial Times’ Energy Transition Summit in New Delhi. “You can’t first wait for a grid to come and then build a renewable project.” Those constraints have become the most visible in the northwestern wind and sun-rich state of Rajasthan and development heavy areas there such as Jaisalmer. IEEFA and JMK estimate that 8GW of clean power capacity in the state currently cannot be transmitted. One renewable industry executive in Rajasthan says the “spurt” of green projects, paired with slow grid growth, will probably slow further capacity build out for at least a couple of years. Developers also face obstacles from environmental blockages and grinding [difficulties acquiring contiguous land](https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e) in a country with hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers. In parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat, a years-long legal ban has prevented new overhead transmission lines from being laid across more than 100,000 sq km to protect the Great Indian Bustard, a [highly endangered and poor-sighted bird](https://www.ft.com/content/cec843fe-804a-43a4-b89a-4f7970c3a6a4) known to fly into power cables. In key areas, smaller players have also exploited those time lags, pre-booking chunks of transmission capacity with no intention of building power plants — driving up premiums to secure connectivity, which they then sell to developers. This delays projects and further burdens genuine operators. Gulia says the bureaucratic need for multi-agency clearances and right-of-way permits that are frequently initiated post-award cause “months to years of delay”. Ideally there should be a single-window regulatory clearance system with strict timelines, she says, as well as performance-based incentives and disincentives. Last year India announced a plan to bolster the power grid and deploy the vast amounts of renewable energy coming online. The expansion is expected to cost Rs9.15tr ($104bn) to allow the transmission of 600GW of green power capacity by 2032. However, India’s Central Electricity Authority agency has acknowledged that public funding will not be sufficient to cover the build-out, which means the private sector is likely to have to step in. Private investment from the likes of Adani and Tata Power is already starting to reshape the sector, Khanna at Adani Green says. About 9 per cent of the grid is operated by corporates. “They are going to bring their own efficiencies to the system,” adds Khanna, “so I am hopeful that in times to come we will have less \\[of a\\] gap.” ### Europe’s Climate Leaders _The FT is compiling its sixth annual list of Europe’s climate leaders.

The situation threatens the nation's clean energy goals. Renewable Powered by - [Bloomberg](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675367/Bloomberg) - Published On Nov 10, 2025 at 03:37 PM IST - - Copy Link - Share on WhatsApp - Share on Linkedin - Share on X - Share on Telegram - Share on Facebook Indias power grid faces significant challenges absorbing a surge in solar installations, leading to record curtailment rates.India’s power grid is struggling to absorb a surge in solar power installations, leading to more curtailment that threatens the build-out of renewables and underscores the need for energy storage.The curtailment rate for solar generation in October rose to about 12 per cent, the highest since May when [Grid Controller of India Ltd.](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/grid+controller+of+india+ltd.) started publishing the data. On some days, about 40 per cent of solar power output was denied access to the national network. Curtailments measure how much electricity was generated without finding its way to customers. Advt The data points to a deepening mismatch between supply and demand when solar generation floods the grid during the day time. Coal power plants can’t reduce output fast enough to make room for surging solar output, and the fossil fuel must be kept in operation as it’s needed to meet demand after the sun sets.The month also saw rare curtailments of wind power, the data showed. This highlights the need to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources with storage, like grid-scale batteries, so that excess electricity can be dispatched in the evening.India has about 44-gigawatts worth of green projects that are struggling to find state utilities to buy their electricity. The government is considering canceling projects where prospects of an offtake deal looks minimal, threatening a goal of doubling clean power capacity to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade. - [Bloomberg](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675367/Bloomberg) - Published On Nov 10, 2025 at 03:37 PM IST - - Telegram - Facebook - Copy Link ## Comments What are your thoughts?

Renewable Powered by - [Bloomberg](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675367/Bloomberg) - Published On Nov 13, 2025 at 03:12 PM IST - - Copy Link - Share on WhatsApp - Share on Linkedin - Share on X - Share on Telegram - Share on Facebook The data highlights a growing mismatch between supply and demand during daytime hours when solar output peaks.India's power grid is struggling to absorb a rapid surge in solar installations, leading to increased curtailment that threatens the pace of renewable expansion and underscores the urgent need for large-scale energy storage. The curtailment rate for solar generation in October rose to about 12 per cent, the highest since May when [Grid Controller of India Ltd.](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/grid+controller+of+india+ltd.) began publishing such data. On some days, as much as 40 per cent of solar power output was denied access to the national grid. Curtailment measures the share of electricity generated but not delivered to consumers. Advt The data highlights a growing mismatch between supply and demand during daytime hours when solar output peaks. Coal-fired plants, which provide base-load power, cannot reduce generation quickly enough to accommodate the solar surge - yet must remain operational to meet demand after sunset.The month also witnessed wind power curtailment, reinforcing the need to integrate intermittent renewable sources with energy storage systems, such as grid-scale batteries, that can dispatch excess electricity in the evening. Currently, about 44 GW of renewable projects in India are struggling to secure PPAs with state utilities. - [Bloomberg](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/agency/88675367/Bloomberg) - Published On Nov 13, 2025 at 03:12 PM IST - - Telegram - Facebook - Copy Link ## Comments What are your thoughts?

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming.

Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....
