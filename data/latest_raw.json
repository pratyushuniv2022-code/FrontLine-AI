The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

    "title": "Weaponizing Markets: India’s Naxalite Insurgency",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "“I have said in the past that left-wing extremism is the single biggest security challenge to the Indian state. It continues to be so.” – Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.[i] From Ideology To Warfare The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. Resurgence Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. A New Strategy “We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.” -Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. Overruns On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • Used improvised explosive devices. Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • Assassinated officials. In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • Destroyed police infrastructure. Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj Systems Disruption At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? The Deviant Economic Engine “The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.” -Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. The Revolutionary Tax In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. A Revolutionary Tax Economy To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • Mining. Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • Narcotics. India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • Informal tolls. Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. A Strategic Half-Life “It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they look to the Naxals for justice.” –Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future.

Today's spy doesn't wear a trench coat or sneak across borders — they slip into servers. A few lines of malicious code, a cleverly worded phishing email, and one careless click are enough to open a backdoor into power grids, defence networks, or corporate vaults. There's no gunfire, no alarm — just a silent invasion across cyberspace.Modern espionage no longer focuses on state secrets alone. It can paralyse ports, jam telecoms, empty bank accounts, and hold critical infrastructure hostage, all from thousands of miles away. Many of these attacks aren't random pranks but well-coordinated operations by advanced persistent threats (APTs) — hacker groups often backed by nation-states who monitor systems for months and even years — or by ‘Spider gangs', the global cybercrime cartels who chase profit, not politics.In Feb 2025, a hacker collective calling itself ‘Keymous+' targeted Gujarat's civic systems, according to FalconFeeds.io, a threat actor repository. The group overwhelmed the websites of Ahmedabad and Surat municipal corporations with fake web traffic in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that crashed the portals for hours. Analysts found that Keymous+ boasted of 700 global attacks in 2025, 27.6% of which were govt entities while the rest ranged from finance and telecom to education. **You Can Also Check: [Ahmedabad AQI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-aqi-level-air-quality-index-today/3252) \\| [Weather in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/weather/ahmedabad-weather-forecast-today/380001) \\| [Gold Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/gold-rates-today/gold-price-in-ahemadabad) \\| [Silver Rate Today in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/silver-rates-today/silver-price-in-ahemadabad)** But others aimed far deeper. In 2020, RedEcho, a group suspected to be backed by a nation-state, infiltrated India's power grid. They did not cause blackouts, but mapped out critical systems like the regional and state load despatch centres (RLDCs and SLDCs) — the nerve centres managing electricity supply — in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and several northern states. Cybersecurity experts at Recorded Future's Insikt group believe the hackers were creating digital \"backdoors\" — hidden entry points — \"to cause potential blackouts in the future\".Then came, TAG-38, another elite adversary sponsored by an enemy nation. Between Sep 2021 and March 2022, \"they targeted at least seven SLDCs in northern and western India, including areas near sensitive border zones\", states the Inskit group report. They cleverly hid their tracks by using hacked DVRs and IP cameras in Taiwan and South Korea to control their attacks remotely. These groups use advanced tools like ShadowPad (a modular malware that can be customised for different attacks) and remote access trojan (RAT) software that lets hackers control a computer from afar. They often get in through spear phishing — tricking someone into clicking a fake email link — or by exploiting weak spots in websites.India also faces threats from APT36 known as ‘Transparent Tribe', another group backed by an enemy nation and active since 2013. In March and April 2025, they disguised malware as updates on the ‘Pahalgam terror attack' to trick officials into opening infected files. They even created fake ministry of defence websites and used a sneaky trick called ClickFix, where malicious code is copied from a user's clipboard without them knowing.Meanwhile, SideCopy, another group, used fake social media profiles and phishing emails to target India's defence personnel. And APT41, also backed by an enemy nation, has been spying on India's healthcare and tech sectors, while also [hacking](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hacking) for money, even manipulating virtual currencies in online games.To combat such threats, Gujarat's science and technology department issued a circular this year, urging all govt employees to strengthen cyber hygiene. \"Do not share official photos or documents online, and never link work emails to personal apps,\" warned principal secretary Mona Kandhar. Officials were reminded that one careless click can compromise an entire department.The war is invisible, but it is already here. Every click, download, or forwarded file could be the entry point for a breach waiting to happen.

    "full_text": "### Global Power Grid Failure: The Ultimate Test of a Disaster Economy ## The Unthinkable Scenario: A Worldwide Blackout Imagine waking up one morning to find every screen dark, every city silent, and every connection gone. No internet, no phone signal, no electricity — anywhere. Airports grounded. Hospitals dark. Satellites flickering. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the nightmare scenario energy planners call a \\*\\* [global grid failure](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=global+grid+failure&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549)\\*\\*. While localized outages are common, a systemic, cross-continental blackout would be unlike anything humanity has faced. It would disrupt water systems, banking, logistics, and communications in a single, cascading event. Within days, cities would struggle for food, fuel, and medical supplies. Within weeks, society would test the limits of order and survival. As impossible as it sounds, the risk isn’t zero. In an era of cyberwarfare, extreme [solar storms](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=solar+storms+electrical+grid&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), and geopolitical instability, experts are quietly asking a chilling question: What if the grid we depend on — globally — simply went dark? ## How the Power Grid Became the World’s Weakest Link The global electrical system was never designed as one coherent network. It’s a loose patchwork of regional grids — the U.S. Eastern, Western, and ERCOT systems, the European [ENTSO-E network](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=ENTSO-E+network&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), and massive interconnections across Asia. Each operates independently yet relies on the same fragile foundations: transmission lines, transformers, substations, and digital control systems. The more connected the world becomes, the more interdependent and vulnerable these systems grow. A cyberattack on one nation’s control nodes, a geomagnetic storm from the sun, or a chain-reaction equipment failure could disable multiple regions simultaneously. In the 21st century, electricity isn’t just energy — it’s existence. Food, transportation, defense, and finance all depend on uninterrupted power. The more sophisticated the grid, the more catastrophic its absence becomes. ## How a Global Grid Failure Could Happen Energy researchers identify three primary pathways for a worldwide electrical collapse: 1. **Cyberattack on control infrastructure:** The world’s grids are managed by industrial control systems (ICS) and [SCADA software](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=define+SCADA+software&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) — often decades old, insecure, and connected to the internet. Coordinated malware could disable protective relays and trip breakers across continents in seconds. 2. **Solar storm or electromagnetic pulse (EMP):** A strong coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun could induce geomagnetic currents that burn out transformers globally. The [1859 Carrington Event](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=1859+Carrington+Event&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) produced auroras as far south as Cuba — today, that same intensity could cripple satellites and transmission lines for years. 3. **Systemic equipment collapse:** With aging infrastructure, spare parts like high-voltage transformers take months to replace. A simultaneous series of failures across continents could outstrip manufacturing capacity and delay recovery indefinitely. Each scenario is improbable on its own — but together, they represent a plausible convergence risk in an age of climate stress, cyber conflict, and geopolitical fragmentation. ## The Domino Effect: 72 Hours to Chaos Most people underestimate how fast modern life unravels when electricity stops. Within hours, pumps at gas stations, water treatment plants, and supermarkets cease functioning. Hospitals switch to limited backup power. ATMs and credit systems go offline, halting commerce. By the third day, refrigerated food spoils, cell towers die, and transportation grinds to a halt. In dense urban areas, law enforcement becomes overwhelmed as communications fail and panic spreads. PowerPlantMaps’ research into past blackouts — from Texas 2021 to India’s 2012 outage affecting 620 million people — shows that even regional failures can paralyze entire economies. A global outage would multiply those effects a thousandfold. ## The Disaster Industrial Complex: Who Profits When the Lights Go Out? Ironically, every blackout fuels a surge of economic activity. Investors, insurers, and infrastructure firms stand ready to profit from reconstruction. Bloomberg estimates that U.S. disaster-related spending now exceeds \\*\\*$1 trillion annually\\*\\*, much of it directed toward energy restoration and backup systems. In this “ [disaster industrial complex](https://www.disasterreliefmaps.com/2025/10/the-rise-of-americas-disaster-economy.html),” every storm, fire, or grid failure becomes an opportunity — a market built on resilience, but driven by collapse. A global power failure would ignite the largest mobilization of resources in human history: satellite launches, microgrid installations, generator sales, and the reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Companies that build batteries, data centers, and private [microgrids](https://blog.solarenergymaps.com/2025/10/the-rise-of-microgrids-and-energy.html) could emerge as the next trillion-dollar winners. The question isn’t whether there will be profits — but who can survive long enough to earn them. ## What Would You Do Without Power? Preparedness experts categorize survival into five pillars: \\*\\*water, food, heat, communication, and mobility.\\*\\* A global outage would test all five simultaneously. - **Water:** Without electricity, municipal pumping stations fail. Gravity-fed systems run dry within days. Households would need stored water or filtration devices. - **Food:** Refrigeration halts and grocery supply chains collapse. Non-perishable goods and local agriculture become survival essentials. - **Heat and cooling:** In extreme climates, lack of HVAC can turn deadly within hours. Wood, propane, and solar heating become vital. - **Communication:** With no cellular or internet networks, shortwave and ham radios become the only long-range communication tools. - **Mobility:** Electric vehicles, gas pumps, and traffic systems stop. Bicycles and manually operated transport regain value. In essence, a total grid failure would revert modern life to the pre-industrial age — but with 8 billion people unprepared to live that way. ## Mapping the Impact: Where Blackouts Hit Hardest At [PowerPlantMaps.com](https://www.powerplantmaps.com), we use historical outage data to identify regions most vulnerable to cascading grid failures. The top risk clusters include: - **[U.S. Gulf Coast](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=US+Gulf+Coast+power+grid+resilience&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549):** Storm-driven outages and coastal grid fragility. - **Europe’s Rhine Corridor:** Flood-induced substation failures. - **South and East Asia:** Overloaded networks from rapid urbanization. - **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Chronic underinvestment and low redundancy. Visualizing these data layers reveals a pattern: the world’s most industrialized zones are also its most grid-dependent. The more developed the region, the steeper the fall when power vanishes. ## The Hidden Players of the Global Grid Few realize that a handful of corporations control the flow of global electricity hardware: [Siemens](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Siemens+electrical+grid+equipment&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), ABB, Hitachi Energy, General Electric, and Schneider Electric manufacture most of the world’s high-voltage equipment. The supply chains for transformers, capacitors, and relays are so concentrated that a single global event could wipe out production capacity. In that case, rebuilding the world’s grid wouldn’t take months — it could take decades. This concentration of control turns grid resilience into both an engineering and geopolitical issue. ## The Rise of Microgrids and Energy Islands To prepare for the unthinkable, nations and cities are experimenting with \\*\\*microgrids\\*\\* — small, self-sufficient energy networks capable of operating independently from the main grid. Universities, hospitals, military bases, and even island nations are building localized systems powered by solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage. During a global grid crisis, these microgrids could form the backbone of recovery. They represent both a technological safeguard and a commercial gold rush: a new frontier in decentralized energy economics. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates over $50 billion in microgrid investment pipelines through 2030. The disaster industrial complex is already betting that the next generation of “resilience infrastructure” will come from these autonomous systems. ## Cybersecurity: The Invisible Battlefield In a hyperconnected world, power grids are no longer physical assets alone — they’re digital battlegrounds. State-sponsored hackers have targeted energy systems from Ukraine to the U.S. since 2015. A coordinated global cyberstrike could compromise grid stability faster than any storm. Governments and utilities now spend billions annually on cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and backup control centers. Yet even the most secure systems remain vulnerable to insider error, outdated software, and the sheer complexity of interconnected networks. In a global failure scenario, cyber resilience would be as important as physical repair. ## Rebuilding After the Global Blackout If a global power failure occurred, recovery would be uneven. Wealthier nations with manufacturing capacity could restore power in months, while others might remain dark for years. The United Nations and World Bank have already modeled post-catastrophe frameworks for global energy recovery — including emergency grids powered by floating nuclear reactors, airborne solar drones, and modular hydro plants. A global blackout could paradoxically accelerate renewable adoption as nations rebuild from scratch using distributed systems instead of centralized grids. In other words, from collapse could come reinvention — if humanity learns the right lessons. ## Personal and Community Resilience For individuals, preparedness is no longer paranoia; it’s prudence. A small investment in off-grid capacity — solar panels, portable batteries, [manual tools](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=manual+tools+survival&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) — can mean survival in prolonged outages. Communities can organize local power cooperatives, stockpile resources, and create neighborhood emergency protocols. On a larger scale, mapping and data transparency are essential. PowerPlantMaps encourages citizens to document blackouts, share outage data, and contribute to public resilience mapping. Knowledge is the first step toward preparedness. ## The Global Wake-Up Call A global grid failure may seem unlikely, but every regional blackout, cyber breach, or solar flare is a warning sign. Humanity’s greatest invention — the electric grid — is also its Achilles’ heel. The \\*\\*disaster industrial complex\\*\\* profits from repair, but resilience demands prevention. The choice facing governments and corporations is clear: invest now in modernization, or pay exponentially later in reconstruction. The world’s survival isn’t about avoiding the dark — it’s about learning how to rebuild the light.

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Ashley, ‘How the Spectre of Hindutva Captured Politics in Kerala,’ The Wire, 30 October 2020](https://thewire.in/politics/kerala-elections-hindutva-muslims) The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement.

Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

    "full_text": "What’s in today’s article? Background Key Events in 2023 India’s Unique Vulnerabilities Earthquake Risks Challenges in Resilience and Insurance Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach Conclusion Background India has witnessed a sharp rise in economic losses due to natural catastrophes, reflecting both the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and the country's vulnerabilities. In 2023, natural disasters caused an estimated $12 billion in economic losses, significantly exceeding the annual average of $8 billion over the past decade, according to a report by global insurance giant Swiss Re. Key Events in 2023 Floods in Northern India and Sikkim (July 2023): Affected Areas: Himachal Pradesh, including Shimla, and Delhi. Impact: Caused extensive damage due to heavy rains between July 10-15, disrupting daily life and infrastructure. Tropical Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023): Landfall: Category 3 cyclone struck Kutch, Gujarat, impacting Maharashtra and Rajasthan as well. Damage: Shut down major ports like Kandla and Mundra, causing extensive damage due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. Tropical Cyclone Michaung (December 2023): Landfall: Hit Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Impact: Brought extreme rainfall, resulting in significant economic losses and urban disruption. India’s Unique Vulnerabilities Monsoon-Driven Floods: Contribution to Losses: Over the past two decades, floods have accounted for an average of 63% of annual economic losses. Monsoon Influence: India's geography and climate expose it to heavy rainfall during: Summer Monsoon (June-September): Causes severe flooding, as seen in Kerala (2018) and Uttarakhand (2013). Northeast Monsoon (October-December): Responsible for floods like Chennai (2015). Economic and Industrial Exposure: States like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu are highly industrialized, contributing 36.8% of India’s total industrial output. These states also face heightened risks: Gujarat: Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. Maharashtra: Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. Tamil Nadu: Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. Earthquake Risks Urban centres like Delhi and Ahmedabad face significant earthquake hazards. A major earthquake in the Himalayas or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the 2001 Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat. Challenges in Resilience and Insurance Despite the scale of economic losses, underinsurance remains a critical issue: Protection Gaps: Over 90% of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. Costliest Flood Events: Mumbai floods (2005): Losses of $5.3 billion (2024 prices) Chennai floods (2015): Losses of $6.6 billion (2024 prices) Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: Hotspot Identification: Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. Risk Assessment: Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. Reinsurance Solutions: Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. Conclusion India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods? Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. Q2. When was NDMA constituted? In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers.

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. ## Document Type Book ## Publication Date 10-2016 ## Publisher National Defense University Press ## City Washington, DC ## Recommended Citation Lynch, Thomas F.

Currently, around 50 GW of renewable energy capacity remains stranded across India due to transmission bottlenecks, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. India needs a comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap that incorporates cluster-level demand forecasting to anticipate emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs. Given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, India must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. Over the past decade, India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy (RE), ranking third behind China and the US in installations and power generation. More than 71% of India's total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately [247 gigawatt (GW),](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/) comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India's power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, [around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/indias-stranded-renewable-projects-double-to-over-50-gw-industry-documents-show/articleshow/123042172.cms?from=mdr), resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad [reaffirmed](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/cea-revises-transmission-plans-every-six-months-for-600-gw-renewables-integration/124114939) the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. **Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system** Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan's great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan's 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The [Rajasthan government’s proposal](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/government-to-establish-2k-mwh-battery-storage-plant-for-solar-power/124316705?utm_source=top_news&utm_medium=sectionListing) this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour(MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. **The need for a strategic roadmap** A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(AHMAD SAHEL ARMAN/AFP via Getty Images) By improving ties with the Taliban, India is seeking to reduce security risks, counterbalance Pakistan’s influence and improve economic opportunities in Afghanistan. But this strategy is likely to achieve only modest results because of Afghanistan’s fragile economic and security environment, as well as New Delhi’s enduring ideological and cultural differences with the Taliban. Indian officials recently visited Afghanistan for the first time since the Taliban took control of the country last year. A delegation led by J.P. Singh -- a secretary overseeing India’s external affairs with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran -- traveled to Kabul on June 6 to discuss the delivery of humanitarian aid with Taliban leaders. With the exception of sending such aid and indirectly contacting Afghanistan through third countries, New Delhi had not established a formal dialogue with Kabul since the Taliban seized power in August 2021. The diplomatic visit reflects India’s new policy of engagement with the...

Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, opens new tab when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington to counter China, political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies discriminating against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - aim to benefit all Indians.

The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups. Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced. Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population. Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

    "full_text": "# India considering $12 billion plan to bail out State power distributors ## The plan marks Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s toughest reform push yet to overhaul the chronically inefficient state-run electricity distribution companies, seen as the weakest link in India’s energy chain Updated \\- October 29, 2025 10:47 pm IST - NEW DELHI Reuters READ LATER [SEE ALL](https://www.thehindu.com/myaccount/?tab=bookmarks) Remove Under the proposal, at least 20% of the State’s total power consumption must be met by private companies and the states must assume part of the retailer’s debt, according to the Power Ministry presentation. File. \\| Photo Credit: K. Bhagya Prakash India is considering a bailout exceeding ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) for debt-laden State-run power distribution companies. To receive the bailout funds, the States will be required to privatise their electric utilities and transfer managerial control or keep control but list them on a stock exchange, according to three government officials and a document outlining the plan prepared by the Ministry of Power. The plan marks Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s toughest reform push yet to overhaul the chronically inefficient state-run electricity distribution companies, seen as the weakest link in India’s energy chain. The Power Ministry and the Ministry of Finance are discussing the final details of the bailout, with an announcement expected in the February budget, said two of the government sources. The Ministries did not immediately respond to _Reuters_’ requests for comments. Under the proposal, at least 20% of the State’s total power consumption must be met by private companies and the states must assume part of the retailer’s debt, according to the Power Ministry presentation. To do so the States can choose to privatise their distribution operations for access to loans to pay off existing debt under two options. First, the States can create a new distribution company, divest 51% of the equity, which will enable them to access a 50-year interest-free loan for the privatised company’s debt, along with access to low-interest Central loans for five years, the presentation showed. The second option would let states privatise up to 26% of the equity of an existing State-owned power distribution company in exchange for access to low-interest loans from the Central government for five years, it showed. Alternatively, states that do not decide to transfer managerial control through privatisation must list their utilities on a recognised stock exchange within three years. States that choose to list would receive low-interest loans from the Central government for infrastructure management, the presentation showed. #### DEBT AND LOSSES The state power retailers have accumulated losses of ₹7.08 trillion ($80.6 billion) and outstanding debt of ₹7.42 trillion ($84.4 billion) as of March 2024, the document showed. Despite three Central bailouts worth billions of dollars over two decades, State-run power distributors remain financially strained, unable to recover costs due to deeply subsidised tariffs. Private companies such as Adani Power, Reliance Power, Tata Power, CESC and Torrent Power are expected to benefit from the reforms as they are likely to gain stakes in the state companies. Past efforts to privatise India’s State-run power distribution firms have faced resistance from employees and opposition parties, which has stalled reforms. “Privatisation is much needed to improve both financial and operational metrics of many power distribution companies. However, this move could face some resistance and will require strong political will,” said Debabrat Ghosh, Head of India, Aurora Energy. Only a handful of distribution zones — including national capital Delhi and industrial states like Maharashtra and Gujarat — are privatised. The government is working on amending the law in the next parliament session to allow private firms to use existing state-run networks.

Hindu nationalist sentiment in the country is increasingly influencing its politics. (NARINDER NANU/AFP/GettyImages) Editor’s Note: Stratfor is republishing this foundational analysis from March 2016 in light of a recent flare-up of Hindu nationalist violence in India. On June 2, police clashed with armed protesters from the Hindu Netaji sect occupying a park in the city of Mathura. At least 24 people were killed and more than 300 protesters were arrested. The Hindu protesters had held the park for the past two years, demanding that India's parliament disband and that the posts of president and prime minister be abolished. In recent months, a surging wave of Hindu nationalism has challenged India's bedrock philosophy of secular pluralism, touching off a raging national debate about the fundamental nature of the country's political identity. This so-called intolerance debate has pitted traditional pluralism against a more strident, conservative religious-based conception of Indian nationhood that seeks to change the underlying principles the nation was founded upon....

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

The country’s electricity grid, which has long been associated with outages, inefficiency, and high losses, is evolving into a digitally empowered network in which real-time data, sensors, and automation drive supply, demand, and distribution. However, as this change accelerates, the essential question is no longer whether India can develop a smart grid, but how and who controls it, particularly as technology replaces current institutional structures. The National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and the Ministry of Power intend to transform India’s electrical system into a “secure, adaptive, sustainable, and digitally enabled ecosystem” via stakeholder perception. India has deployed over 40 million smart meters by mid-2025, indicating progress in the development of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). However, despite lofty goals and hardware deployment, obstacles remain. FSR Global’s March 2025 research identified a fundamental problem in developing an interoperable smart grid ecosystem, including limitations in standards, insufficient data governance, vendor fragmentation, and cyber-security concerns. Smart grids usher in a fundamentally new form of “governance”—one mediated by algorithms. AI-powered systems predict loads, reroute supply, detect defects, and (in some situations) determine dynamic tariffs. Cities like Delhi are the first to use these kinds of technologies, and state utilities are working with companies from around the world to use advanced analytics. For example, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (MSEDCL) made a deal with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to improve its system with AI, machine learning, and battery energy storage devices. But this choice makes it hard to tell who is at fault. If an algorithm sends out goods incorrectly, places businesses ahead of families, or charges a peak surcharge, who is to blame? The rules and laws haven’t been updated to align with how technology operates in the real world. If algorithmic decisions aren’t clear, operations might not be clear either. In the smart grid, data is as important as copper lines. Smart meters collect specific consumption patterns down to the appliance level; an analytics tool interprets the data and utilises it to improve network performance. But this makes people worry about privacy, security, and fairness. A recent poll by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) found that consumers are worried about billing accuracy, connectivity issues, and data privacy, which are all making it harder to roll out smart meters. Regulatory frameworks also fall behind. While the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2022, includes significant structural reforms, it does not address data ownership rights, algorithmic transparency, or consumer redress. Unless these loopholes are bridged, smart grids may recreate existing hierarchies in a new digital format. India is switching to smart grids for a number of reasons, but one of the most important is to deal with the growing amount of renewable energy, largely solar and wind, that is being used more and more at the distribution level. Smart systems help balance energy generation that happens at different times, control battery storage, and make prosumer (consumer-plus-producer) possible. The government also recently extended the interstate transmission system (ISTS) charge waiver for battery energy storage projects until June 2028. This is a big incentive for stabilising grids with a lot of renewable energy. However, as one _FT_ analysis on the “solar village” project in Gujarat highlighted, storage capacity remains a bottleneck: India needs 336 GWh by 2030, but predictions for 2026-27 are just 82 GWh. Not every state is moving at the same rate. In Karnataka, the implementation of smart meters under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) has suffered delays. A state official recently stated that even with subsidies, costs will not drop below Rs 1,000 per meter in Bengaluru. The state is still reviewing whether to opt in. In another example, India’s transmission authority recently withdrew grid access for approximately 17 GW of delayed clean-energy projects in states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in order to prioritise projects that are ready for implementation. For areas experiencing energy poverty, the transition to smart grids is about more than just efficiency; it’s about justice. The promise of increased reliability, lower losses, and lower tariffs exists, but only if the transformation is equitable. The key dimensions of justice include distributive, procedural, and recognitional. These measures demonstrate that, even as smart grid technology advances, execution limits. If smart grid governance remains opaque, the risk is a two-tier energy system: a “well-connected algorithmic” grid for some and a weak heritage grid for others. To make smart grids work for India, not just utilities, policy must keep up with technology. Algorithmic accountability frameworks require openness, auditability, and human monitoring in grid-decision systems. Data governance regime aims to figure out who owns data about how consumers use electricity, how it can be used and shared, and how to get consent. In systemic cyber resilience, it is needed to ensure that even smaller DISCOMs establish Cyber Security Operations Centers (CSOCs) and undertake regular audits. Equitable rollout options include prioritising states with high energy poverty for meter improvements, analytics tools, and demand-response programs. Secondly, interoperability standards accelerate the integration of grid protocols, vendor systems, and communication networks to prevent smart systems from becoming proprietary silos. Power plants and transmission lines will no longer define India’s energy future; instead, algorithms will play an increasingly important role. But the real test is how those algorithms are run: do they help people or systems? Do they help make things fairer or make things worse? Smart grids provide the basis for the transformation that India needs to make in order to reach its goal of 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. The grid might be getting smarter, but the people in charge need to be too. India’s move to smart grids is more than just a technological leap; it also means a change in how the energy business is run, how people are held accountable, and how justice is served. As computers take over more and more of the control of electricity flows, the decision of who gets energy, when, and for how much money moves from people to machines. This move, although promising to make things more efficient and reliable, also shows some big hazards, such as breaches of data privacy, unequal access, and slow government action. As India moves from physical to digital infrastructure, it needs to make sure that the intelligence that runs its grids is fair, accessible, and overseen by the people. _Anusreeta Dutta is a columnist and climate researcher with prior experience as a political researcher and ESG analyst._ _Aakash Bajpai is Student, Indian Institute of Forest Management._ _Views expressed are the author’s own and don’t necessarily reflect those of_ Down To Earth [power](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/power) [Privacy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/privacy) [security](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/security) [algorithms](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/algorithms) [fairness](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/fairness) Show Comments Down To Earth www.downtoearth.org.in INSTALL APP",

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) In early fall, we examined the implications of increasing energy prices, including their potential to generate social unrest. Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

More than 71 percent of India’s total installed renewable energy capacity, which stands at approximately 247 gigawatt (GW), comes from solar and wind installations. This surge in clean energy generation, particularly from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like solar and wind, is prompting a paradigm shift in power transmission dynamics. Power transmission is a critical component of the electricity value chain, and a robust and resilient network is essential for integrating the increasing RE capacity into the grid. Historically, India’s power transmission network has been among the most advanced in the world, characterised by proactive planning and upgrades that have resulted in minimal congestion and strong operational performance. However, the significantly shorter gestation periods of VRE installations have left the transmission network struggling to keep pace with RE deployment. The result is a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of energy evacuation infrastructure. The diurnal and seasonal variability of VRE further complicates transmission planning, leading to stranded RE assets and underutilisation of transmission infrastructure. Currently, around 50 GW of RE capacity is stranded across India, resulting in cost overruns, delayed returns, and diminished investor confidence. The rising complications in VRE evacuation and its integration into the power transmission network have prompted power regulators to ramp up their transmission planning efforts. In September 2025, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad reaffirmed the goal of integrating 600 GW of renewables into India’s power grid by 2032. He noted that to ensure seamless integration, the CEA has shifted to potential-based planning, adding that the plans will be revised every six months to reflect continuously evolving ground realities. Monthly meetings are also being held to expedite investment planning and prevent delays in approvals and execution. ## Obstacles to an efficient power transmission system Turning the increased planning efforts into actual implementation will require addressing the persistent challenges that hinder the development of green power transmission, like difficulties in land acquisition for right of way, and overseas transmission equipment procurement constraints, among other issues. Also, state-specific issues—such as Rajasthan’s great Indian bustard (GIB) case concerning the critically endangered bird’s deaths from collisions with overhead power lines—further demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of delays that transmission network expansion can face, stretching gestation periods of transmission projects further vis-à-vis solar and wind. Rajasthan, in particular, is grappling with significant transmission bottlenecks, making it a hotspot of stranded RE assets. The primary reasons for this include delayed commissioning of transmission infrastructure, technical and ecological hurdles, and speculative grid access. As of July 2025, around 8 GW out of Rajasthan’s 22 GW of operational inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected RE projects remained stranded. Additionally, these projects also faced generation curtailment of roughly 3.8 GW in the same month. These issues underscore the broader problem of rapidly developing geographically concentrated RE capacity without adequate planning and growth of evacuation infrastructure. The Rajasthan government’s proposal this year to establish 2,000 megawatt-hour (MWh) of grid-scale battery energy storage aims to mitigate RE power curtailments and improve state grid utilisation. ## The need for a strategic roadmap A comprehensive state-wise green power transmission roadmap is essential to ensure that Rajasthan and other RE-rich states can sustainably integrate future RE capacity additions. This roadmap should be target-oriented and timeline-bound with clearly specified deadlines and associated penalties. It should incorporate cluster-level demand forecasting by coordinating with state IT, industry, and urban development agencies to identify emerging high-intensity loads like data centres and electric vehicle charging (EV) hubs. Moreover, given the ongoing rise in electricity demand and land prices, the roadmap must prioritise overbuilding of transmission assets, even at the cost of initial underutilisation. The roadmap should also recognise the importance of energy storage systems (ESS). Critical in power generation and distribution, ESSs will also play a vital role in the green power transmission sector. At key transmission nodes, storage systems can provide valuable ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage stability, congestion management, and black start capabilities. The roadmap must incorporate and clearly specify the state-wise transmission-focused energy storage requirements. India’s power transmission sector is highly concentrated and averse to foreign and private sector investment. Encouraging participation and fostering an investor-friendly climate will be essential to build the requisite transmission capacity organically. Transmission planning and operations must leverage advanced forecasting, load-flow modelling, and real-time monitoring to enhance predictability and operational efficiency. Additionally, there is a need to move beyond conventional power purchase agreement (PPA) or merit-order based dispatch systems and transition to a security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) model. SCED optimises real-time generation schedules by accounting for constraints such as transmission limits, generator ramp rates, and reserve requirements. Ultimately, a modern and robust transmission network will form the invisible backbone of India’s power sector, one that is flexible, resilient, and fully aligned with the country’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

Surrounding the golden fortress city of Jaisalmer in India’s Thar desert, a sea of wind turbines stretches out across the arid landscape as far as the eye can see — visibly marking the world’s third-largest carbon emitter’s green power expansion. Engineers at a 30MW wind farm here operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest clean energy developers, speak with pride about contributing to a national renewable capacity goal of 500GW by 2030. Yet not all of the country’s green power can be dispatched, with the energy grid emerging as a choking constraint. Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew, is confident India will “definitely” achieve its renewable capacity target. “I can see that we’ll get to 500GW, but we won’t be able to exceed it because there’s not enough transmission.” While India boasts one of the world’s largest transmission networks, spanning more than 494,000 circuit kilometres, the grid has not kept pace with the surge in renewable projects. More than 50GW of capacity is stranded, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a US-based think-tank, and JMK Research & Analytics, an Indian cleantech research and consulting firm. © Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images “Transmission has become a critical bottleneck . . . causing rising curtailment and commissioning delays in resource-rich states,” says Jyoti Gulia, founder and chief executive of JMK. Earlier this year, Pralhad Joshi, India’s minister for new and renewable energy, hailed a “Historic Green Leap” after the country reached 50 per cent of its [power capacity from renewables](https://www.ft.com/content/a99a5845-9f50-49a3-8c7c-d704b2cf3b95), now totalling 243GW. Even so, Gulia says, grid expansion delays would “lock in higher coal generation”. Nearly three-quarters of India’s power currently comes from coal, which remains central to meeting its growing electricity demand. This is partly due to fragmented planning between state and central authorities, which largely run India’s grid, as well as mismatched build cycles. Renewable projects can be completed in 12 to 18 months, while transmission lines typically take three to five years. Clean power is also predominantly produced in three states: Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while high demand regions such as Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have little capacity, making cross state delivery critical. “To perfect the timing is impossible,” Ashish Khanna, chief executive of Adani Green Energy — the country’s largest renewable power company — said in September at the Financial Times’ Energy Transition Summit in New Delhi. “You can’t first wait for a grid to come and then build a renewable project.” Those constraints have become the most visible in the northwestern wind and sun-rich state of Rajasthan and development heavy areas there such as Jaisalmer. IEEFA and JMK estimate that 8GW of clean power capacity in the state currently cannot be transmitted. One renewable industry executive in Rajasthan says the “spurt” of green projects, paired with slow grid growth, will probably slow further capacity build out for at least a couple of years. Developers also face obstacles from environmental blockages and grinding [difficulties acquiring contiguous land](https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e) in a country with hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers. In parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat, a years-long legal ban has prevented new overhead transmission lines from being laid across more than 100,000 sq km to protect the Great Indian Bustard, a [highly endangered and poor-sighted bird](https://www.ft.com/content/cec843fe-804a-43a4-b89a-4f7970c3a6a4) known to fly into power cables. In key areas, smaller players have also exploited those time lags, pre-booking chunks of transmission capacity with no intention of building power plants — driving up premiums to secure connectivity, which they then sell to developers. This delays projects and further burdens genuine operators. Gulia says the bureaucratic need for multi-agency clearances and right-of-way permits that are frequently initiated post-award cause “months to years of delay”. Ideally there should be a single-window regulatory clearance system with strict timelines, she says, as well as performance-based incentives and disincentives. Last year India announced a plan to bolster the power grid and deploy the vast amounts of renewable energy coming online. The expansion is expected to cost Rs9.15tr ($104bn) to allow the transmission of 600GW of green power capacity by 2032. However, India’s Central Electricity Authority agency has acknowledged that public funding will not be sufficient to cover the build-out, which means the private sector is likely to have to step in. Private investment from the likes of Adani and Tata Power is already starting to reshape the sector, Khanna at Adani Green says. About 9 per cent of the grid is operated by corporates. “They are going to bring their own efficiencies to the system,” adds Khanna, “so I am hopeful that in times to come we will have less \\[of a\\] gap.” ### Europe’s Climate Leaders _The FT is compiling its sixth annual list of Europe’s climate leaders.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints.

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply.

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ...",

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "With Washington launching its protectionist trade offensive, New Delhi faces a pivotal test in balancing national interests and global market access. **Impact of US tariffs**: The much-dreaded Liberation Day, Washington’s euphemism for a sweeping wave of tariffs, finally arrived on April 2. As anticipated, India found itself on the receiving end, with a 26% tariff slapped on its exports to the United States. The move has raised serious concerns about the future of trade ties between New Delhi and its largest export destination. In a dramatic shift from traditional diplomacy, President Donald Trump announced that the US would impose tariffs equal to half of what other countries charge on American goods. Since India levies a cumulative 52% tariff on US products, the new White House annexure listed a reciprocal 27% tariff on Indian goods. But this is only the beginning. According to a White House fact sheet, a 10% base tariff on all imports will take effect from April 5. From April 9, countries running the highest trade deficits with the US — including India — will face even steeper levies. A total of 185 countries are expected to be impacted. With these moves, the average US tariff rate has now surged to 29% — its highest level in over a century. **READ \\| [Ayushman Bharat: A grand promise undone by poor execution](https://www.policycircle.org/society/ayushman-bharat-scheme-pmjay/)** ### **Blow to India’s export ambitions** The fallout for India is likely to be significant. The US is one of the few major economies with which India enjoys a trade surplus — $46 billion as of 2024. However, these gains now stand threatened. India had already been in Washington’s crosshairs, featuring in Trump’s infamous Dirty 15 list — countries deemed the worst offenders in terms of trade practices. The sectors expected to be hit hardest include agriculture, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and precious stones. #### Trump effect: Additional US tariffs on India Compiled by Murali Kallummal, Professor, Centre for WTO Studies, IIFT According to a recent study by the Global Trade Research Initiative ( [GTRI](https://gtri.co.in/)), the most affected agricultural segments will be fish, meat, and processed seafood — which together accounted for $2.58 billion in exports to the US last year. Notably, America absorbs 40% of India’s total shrimp exports. Higher tariffs will erode competitiveness and shrink market share. India’s gains in electronics could also unravel. The Indian government had worked to position the country as a viable alternative to China under the China+1 strategy, especially in smartphone manufacturing. Finished smartphones currently attract a 16-20% import duty in India, while Indian exports to the US enjoy zero duty. But if US tariffs now apply to Indian phones, the fledgling sector may suffer a blow in its early growth phase, potentially reversing hard-won progress. One silver lining, however, is that India’s IT services — which form a large chunk of exports — are exempt from goods-specific tariffs, at least for now. ### **Navigating a rising trade storm** The pressing question for India’s policymakers is: how to counter mounting trade pressure from Washington without derailing its export-led growth strategy? A crucial step would be to fast-track the ongoing negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US. Talks have been in motion, and both sides have incentives to reach an accord quickly. A successful BTA could offer exemptions or relief from some of the punitive measures. India has already taken pre-emptive steps. In March, New Delhi signed the terms of reference for a BTA following a push from the Prime Minister’s Office. It also lowered duties on select American products — including high-end motorcycles, agricultural goods, and Bourbon whiskey — in its Union Budget, signalling a willingness to negotiate. Still, New Delhi must tread carefully. While India’s tariff levels may appear high, they reflect domestic development goals and the need to protect vulnerable industries. The US prioritises its commercial interests. India too must evaluate each demand against its own national priorities — development, industrialisation, and cultural values. A recent PwC report recommended that Indian businesses build long-term resilience strategies — including diversification of markets and value chain upgrades — to mitigate the impact of US protectionism. ### **Strategic realignments** Amid this backdrop, an intriguing diplomatic overture emerged. On April 2 — coinciding with the US tariff announcement — China and India marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a message to Indian President Droupadi Murmu, called for a “dragon-elephant tango” to strengthen cooperation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed the sentiment, noting that stronger India-China ties would support a stable, multipolar world. Observers see this as a subtle signal to Washington: major developing economies are willing to explore alternative alliances if pushed too hard. Xi emphasised the need for mutual modernisation between China and India as leading voices of the Global South — perhaps suggesting a pivot away from overreliance on Western markets. ### **The road ahead** The 26% reciprocal tariff may compel India to re-examine its own tariff structures, not just in response to the US, but to remain competitive in global markets. The coming weeks will be critical as New Delhi awaits a formal list of US demands and considers its options. India remains an essential market for US companies across sectors — from tech to pharmaceuticals — and this mutual interdependence offers room for compromise. India’s strategy should be to engage the US in negotiations rather than escalate into a full-blown trade war. As noted in a Bernstein report, India’s measured, diplomatic approach could help it navigate the turbulent waters of trade protectionism, preserving both economic stability and strategic autonomy.

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....
