These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India [CPI]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external secu\u0002rity partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of do\u0002mestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an In\u0002dian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime secu\u0002rity activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counter\u0002terrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington. 2 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Introduction This paper frames the contours of the recent and ongoing expansion in U.S.-India security ties. Then it briefly sketches the trajectory of the Naxalite insurgency through its first two phases and then focuses on the factors that made its third phase—from 2004 to the present—such a serious security challenge. The paper highlights the unique domestic factors that allowed the Naxalite rebellion’s rise to the status of India’s most significant internal security challenge from 2007 to 2010. It also identifies those domestic factors that enabled effective counterinsurgency actions beginning in 2011 and effective containment of the threat by 2014. After indicating the kinds of bilateral security assistance offered by the United States to India in recent years, the paper indicates the limited appeal of outside assistance to India in the domestic counterinsur\u0002gency arena and assesses why India’s self-selected counterinsurgency partnership limitations remain firmly in place. It concludes with some lessons learned for U.S. policymakers in terms of the opportunities and limitations for working with India in matters of domestic insurgency, advising that these limitations make sense on many levels. It also asserts that India’s limitations should be respected in Washington and Honolulu to avoid backlash from New Delhi. Any such backlash might threaten far more important U.S.-India bilateral interests in which shared mari\u0002time and other strategic interests seem to increasingly diverge with those of China and in areas of mutual benefit from global counterterrorism cooperation. The analysis in this paper is based on 3 years of author research into the unique features of the Naxalite insurgency in India. The research includes field interviews conducted on three visits to India during 2014 and 2015, one of which featured time in Kolkata and West Bengal. Expanding U.S.-India Security Framework, with Limits Growing for more than a decade, bilateral defense and security cooperation between the United States and India began accelerating quickly in 2014 and continued into 2016. Much of this acceleration, although not all of it, owed to the tone and tenor of the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected and seated in 2014. Modi’s government, which is Indian nationalist with a dynamic economic, diplomatic, and security agenda, followed a decade-long Indian National Congress (INC) government that had become sclerotic in its dealings with the United States and other global partners from 2009 to 2013. The INC government set the table for U.S.-India defense and security cooperation during the mid-2000s, demonstrating a broad\u0002based Indian commitment to improved bilateral relations with the United States after decades 3 India’s Naxalite Insurgency of limited transactions. But the nationalist government of Prime Minister Modi has been driv\u0002ing it forward vigorously. The ongoing acceleration in broad Indo-American relations has taken many forms, in\u0002cluding high diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi made visiting the United States a priority, travel\u0002ing to America within 4 months of his May 2014 accession to the position of prime minister. Modi then made President Barack Obama the first ever U.S. President bestowed the high honor as chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade in January 2015. During this visit, Obama and Modi signed a historic Joint U.S.-India Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.1 Modi made a third informal visit to the United States in September 2015, using this historically rapid return to enhance economic relations between the national private and public sectors.2 The United States has committed to a wide array of economic projects in India fea\u0002turing public-private innovation, deeper financial cooperation and inclusive digital networks, “smart city” development in selected Indian cities, and support for increasing economic con\u0002nectivity between India and the states of South and Southeast Asia.3 The acceleration of broad bilateral ties has been showcased by the steady increase in de\u0002fense and security cooperation between the two countries. In June 2016, on a historic fourth visit to the United States and in conjunction with a third bilateral summit,4 Prime Minister Modi made a joint statement with President Obama declaring India and the United States to be “major defense partners,” expressing aspirations for expanded exchange of dual-use technolo\u0002gies and maritime security cooperation.5 The outcomes from this mid-2016 leadership engage\u0002ment underscored the fact that there have been noteworthy enhancements in military technol\u0002ogy interaction processes, basic military logistics and administrative arrangements, and joint military exercises. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi has accelerated the process of bilateral security collabo\u0002ration on military modernization with emphasis on greater foreign investment in the Indian defense sector than ever before. Modi’s government covets American participation in India’s defense industry build-out to a degree not seen in the previous Indian government. The United States has worked to expand its 2012 bilateral defense initiative with India known as the U.S.- India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Pursuant to President Obama’s January 2015 visit for Republic Day, the United States has focused DTTI in pursuit of six major defense technology co-development and co-production efforts. There has been a particular focus on deeper cooperation in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.6 The United States and India also have done serious work on establishing basic frame\u0002work defense agreements that would enable closer cooperation and collaboration between their 4 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 militaries. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, both governments worked hard to develop mutu\u0002ally acceptable text for three critical military-to-military agreements. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), Basic Exchange and Coopera\u0002tion Agreement (BECA), and—perhaps the most consequential of the three—Logistics Supply Agreement.7 Aimed to move beyond the limited U.S.-India 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement that underpinned modest U.S.-India defense interactions for more than a decade, the bilateral effort on these documents demonstrated important forward prog\u0002ress. Yet this progress did not beget culmination in formal agreements. Many observers hoped that these arrangements would be ready for signature during Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s April 2016 visit to New Delhi for discussions with Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar. But Indian sensitivities and complications in language and trust limited the April joint announce\u0002ment to one confirming that the defense leaders were agreed in principal—but had not yet signed—a modified Logistics Supply Agreement, known as a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement.8 It also signaled that both parties must continue to work on “other” agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer. The CISMOA and BECA were not formally mentioned in the final statement of the meeting.9 In the area of joint military exercises, the U.S.-India partnership has been expanding. In 2015, India conducted more joint military exercises with the U.S. military than any other in the world.10 India and United States agreed in 2015 to extend a permanent invitation for Japanese naval forces to participate annually in Exercise Malabar. The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations. While agreeing to participate in the 2016 Malabar exercise with Japan and the United States in the northern Philippines, India firmly declined an offer by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, to sign on for joint naval patrols with the United States, Japan, and Aus\u0002tralia in the South Pacific.12 India also has remained wary of any firm commitment to a bilateral defense CISMOA or BECA. Despite more than 2 years of bilateral effort, there remains no real progress on the joint development of jet engines or aircraft carrier technologies—both of which are target technologies for joint development.13 Each of these factors and more demonstrate that crafting a bilateral defense partnership between the United States and India will be a slow process 5 India’s Naxalite Insurgency that requires better understanding of differing critical equities. This process requires sustained, patient leadership in both countries in the face of certain frustrations moving forward. Scoping Bilateral Security Collaboration Limits: Indian Domestic Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism The U.S. and Indian militaries have their own detailed and unique experiences in counter\u0002insurgency operations, so counterinsurgency seems a logical focal point for greater U.S.-India defense collaboration and partnership, and in many ways it is. But in other ways, it is not. U.S. policymakers and security analysts should understand the differences. When it comes to outside assistance and security partnership collaboration with India in its ongoing experiences with domestic insurgency, U.S. policymakers and military leaders must remain aware that India does not—and likely will not—treat U.S. military offers of direct assis\u0002tance with a warm welcome. India’s experiences with its long-running domestic Naxalite insur\u0002gency provide a powerful example about the limited scope for U.S. military engagement and the circumspect manner in which any U.S. security assistance must be approached with New Delhi. The lessons about context, tenor, and tone found in the example of the Naxalite insurgency over the past 10 years demonstrate that the United States is a better partner for India when remaining at distance, as New Delhi deals with its unique domestic insurgency challenges. India’s Approach to Domestic Insurgency Over the past 60 years, India has confronted three major domestic insurgencies.14 In Jam\u0002mu and Kashmir, disaffected Muslim groups and unsatisfied local populations have contested India’s so-called occupation of its territories on the southeastern side of the Line of Control. India’s northeast has undergone multiple, overlapping waves of tribal, socioethnic-based insur\u0002gent movements since the mid-1950s. These northeastern separatist insurgencies have ebbed and flowed as Indian military and political approaches to their grievances eliminated some and catalyzed others. India also has been confronted with economic class–based violence and armed confrontation in its eastern regions, violence referred to as a Naxalite or Maoist insurgency. Numerous Indian analysts, and some outsiders, argue that India has among the best re\u0002cords in the world when combating insurgencies.15 The claim is debatable on many levels. Yet it does accurately reflect that India has persistent experience with a variety of domestic insurgencies over a considerable period of time. Official Indian counterinsurgency doctrine formally espouses a population-centric strategy focused on winning “hearts and minds.”16 A more detailed examination of India’s record reveals that India often does take a political 6 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 approach in combination with a military one when facing domestic insurgencies. However, India’s political approaches often are less about hearts and minds and more often feature ex\u0002tended periods of national-level tolerance of state- and local-level politician and police leader\u0002ship manipulation of insurgent groups. Often this manipulation is in the pursuit of regional and local vote banks (or vote blocks). Frequently manipulation is followed by the co-option of rebellion elites in an effort to buy-out, or limit the insurgency once it festers to a level beyond the ability of the state and regional authorities to manage. Co-option approaches have taken the forms of turning insurgents through monetary compensation, creating new political space for a “turned” insurgent group, or abducting and torturing key insurgent leaders.17 Quite often these nonkinetic approaches have created their own problems with corrupt security forces, increased criminal activity, and a litany of human rights complaints and investigations.18 India’s employment of military forces in domestic counterinsurgency operations has fea\u0002tured a number of innovative practices, some successful and others counterproductive. When engaged fully, the Indian national response tends to feature a combination of state police forces, Central Armed Police Forces, special paramilitary units, and—in some cases such as Kashmir and India’s Northeast—the introduction of regular army units. India’s federal statutes mandate that the chief minister (or governor) of a state formally request national police (including Cen\u0002tral Armed Police Forces units), paramilitary, or national army support before such forces can be introduced into a counterinsurgency fight. In those cases when the army is introduced, it must be authorized by the prime minister and given authorities by the Indian parliament to operate under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which includes the authority for military forces to make arrests, search without warrants, and shoot to kill civilians when required.19 In\u0002dia’s martial counterinsurgency activities are normally “enemy centric” and have been assessed to regularly feature a strategy of attrition and raw coercion where overwhelming numbers of security forces attempt to suffocate the insurgency at the same time that political activities are conducted to co-opt its leadership.20 There are several important conclusions to be drawn about India’s historical approach to domestic counterinsurgency. First, India does pursue varied counterinsurgency approaches to its multiple domestic insurgencies, depending on the unique context of each. Some respons\u0002es—such as those in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast India—have featured a permanent deployment of the Indian army. Other responses, such as those toward the respective phases of the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India, have been limited to national central armed police forces (mainly but not exclusively Central Reserve Police Forces [CRPF]) deployment into the unsettled states from the central government (see appendix B for detail on national special 7 India’s Naxalite Insurgency police units). Second, India’s political and military approaches toward domestic insurgency generally do not follow a classic hearts and minds approach. Instead, they normally feature enemy-centric and highly kinetic military operations combined with creative, and often con\u0002troversial, political co-option of selected insurgent groups and group leaders. Third, India’s federal democratic structure often drives domestic counterinsurgency responses that feature uncomfortable political tradeoffs at the local level, state level, and between the state and the national governments. The political mobilization aspect of domestic insurgent groups creates incentives for political parties to harness these groups for their own ends.21 Invariably, this political utility makes them hard to counter in a timely manner and then difficult to address in the face of growing corruption, illegal activities, and often human rights questions as they embed into the political and social space. In general, Indian domestic counterinsurgency has worked for the country out and its distinctive system of governance and its complex national ethnic makeup. India’s approaches have contained, but not eliminated, the three major insurgencies that it has faced since inde\u0002pendence. But for many Westerners, India’s domestic counterinsurgency “successes” can look exceptionally violent and uncomfortably incomplete.22 This divergence in perspectives is im\u0002portant. It indicates why India prefers strict autonomy in the conduct of its domestic counterin\u0002surgent operations, routinely brushing aside the limited offers of direct outside military support that it receives. It also demonstrates why outside partners, including the United States, should realize that if they push too aggressively in offering well-intentioned direct assistance in these areas, they could encounter significant resistance in New Delhi—possible to the point where security cooperation could be dampened in other more important areas of mutual interest. India’s deep past and recent experiences with the Naxalite insurgency demonstrate the wisdom of these conclusions. The Naxalite Insurgency—History and Context: Phases 1 and 2 The Naxalite insurgency started as a communist peasant revolt in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It later evolved into a combination of ethnic-, caste-, and class-based political violence across a number of the poorest provinces in India’s east.23 It became known as Naxalism, or the Naxalite movement, given its late 1950s origins as a Maoist movement struggling for in\u0002dependence in the small village of Naxalbari in the state of West Bengal, along the Indo-Nepal border (see map 1).24 The 1967 Naxalbari uprising against feudal landlords sowed the seeds for insurgency in India.25 8 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 The Naxalites were a group of far-left radical communists who promoted Maoist political sentiment and ideology to fight exploitation by landlords in India’s feudal postcolonial socio\u0002economic system. In this approach, the Naxalites broke from the tradition of Indian communist Map 1. States and Union Territories of India 9 India’s Naxalite Insurgency political participation in the electoral system supplemented by general worker strikes that had been the staple of Communist Party of India activity from the 1920s through the 1950s.26 Dur\u0002ing the 1940s and 1950s, the CPI had become aligned with Moscow in its international leanings, functioning in India mainly as a political party. Around the same time, communism in India split in a third direction, with the CPI-Marxist group taking a more radical approach to its po\u0002litical rhetoric but mainly pursuing its own independent parliamentary path.27 Naxalism is based upon an extremist belief that the Indian government is a semicolonial, feudalistic, and imperial entity that needs to be overthrown. Naxalism’s objective is to seize state power through a protracted armed struggle against big landlords and petty government of\u0002ficials. Naxalism takes up the cause of the marginalized sections of society. It often opposes the implementation of various developmental projects such as construction of roads, rails, schools, and hospitals in affected areas in order to demonstrate to the people the ineffectiveness of the state. When successful, the Naxalite movement has operated in a vacuum created by the absence or collapse of the administrative structure at the local, provincial, or state level.28 The Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. A short review of the first two phases of the Naxalite insurgency establishes its patterns and India’s preferred security framework for dealing with this domestic stability threat. A more detailed review of the third and most noteworthy phase of the Naxalite insurgency follows in a subsequent section. First Phase, 1967–1973 Inspired by Maoist revolutionary tactics and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Naxalite movement gained momentum and began in the late 1960s and 1970s. Initially the movement centered in the Indian states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh (map 1). It featured peasants seizing land by force and then taking up arms to protect themselves against police and landlord response.29 Soon these rural activities merged with politically disillusioned and ideologically driven university students from Kolkata and other urban areas in India’s Far East—with active cells stretching from the state of Bihar in the north to Adhra Pradesh in the south. By 1969 un\u0002der charismatic leader Charu Mazumdar, the Naxalites organized as the CPI–Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) and attempted more centralized and violent tactics.30 CPI-ML moved to organize peasants and seize political power through guerilla warfare while focusing on annihilation of its class enemies.31 In urban areas such as Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), Naxalite insurgents 10 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 targeted police and local constables, attacking police outposts and patrols with an aim to cap\u0002ture weapons.32 Despite some limited weapons assistance and rhetorical support from Mao’s Communist government in the 1960s, China never undertook a strong campaign of support for the Nax\u0002alites.33 The Naxalites remained fragmented and without much training or organization. This first wave of Naxalite violence peaked in 1971 when over 3,650 acts of class-based attacks were reported and more than 850 people were reported killed. But it quickly succumbed to its own weaknesses and a state counterinsurgency response that featured two waves of activity. From the summer of 1969 through the end of 1971, state-led counterinsurgency campaigns against the rural Naxalite cadres decimated much of those insurgency cadres. State police, as\u0002sisted by the CRPF, moved against poorly armed Naxalites with great effect. By 1971 these po\u0002lice forces were joined by army units deployed into West Bengal. It took the failure of local and state police to contain Naxalite insurgents for more than 2 years before the West Bengal deputy chief minister—himself a politician from the CPI-Maoist party—requested assistance from a central paramilitary force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles, to assist state security forces. Then in July and August of 1971 a more dangerous component of the Naxalite insurgency in West Ben\u0002gal’s Birbhum District was put down by a joint campaign led by the army known as Operation Steeplechase. Army involvement only came after the collapse of an Indian National Congress– led coalition government in West Bengal and the New Delhi declaration of “President’s Rule” throughout the region. This made the central government responsible for the fight against the Naxalites and enabled Prime Minister Indira Ghandi to divert elements of the army massing along the East Pakistan border for what would become the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani War that assisted local police in decisive counterinsurgency operations.34 The urban dimension of the first wave of the Naxalite insurgency remained violent throughout 1971 and festered into the next 2 years, even as the rural component succumbed to Operation Steeplechase. Interparty political violence in Kolkata among the INC, CPI-M, and CPI-ML led to a swirl of assassinations and attacks against security forces and political leaders across urban areas. The election of a new West Bengal chief minister from the INC in March 1972 turned the tide on the urban Naxals. The law and order platform of Chief Minister Sid\u0002dharth Shankar Ray played out in a much more muscular police role across Kolkata and its surroundings throughout mid-1972 and into mid-1973. Kolkata police apprehended Naxalite leader Charu Maumdar in July 1972, and he died in custody several weeks later. Naxalite lead\u0002ers across the city succumbed to increasing police and state paramilitary presence. By 1973 the main cadres of the Naxalites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars.35 11 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In this first Naxalite insurgent phase, the national government followed a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent phases. It did not forcibly intervene in the beginning. In keep\u0002ing with the federalist framework of the constitution, the government in New Delhi left it to local and state officials in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and other afflicted states to take their own security actions to stop the threat. In the late 1960s, these state and local responses were often inadequate and ineffective.36 The central government only engaged with security forces once it had a critical mass of army forces in the region for the 1971–1972 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh and when the President’s Rule special authorities were in place, which enabled the military the power to make preventative arrests, search premises without a warrant, and shoot to kill civilians. Once engaged, the slowly evolving national response became one featuring intense force and coercion, eradicating the violence without eliminating the insurgency’s socio\u0002economic preconditions. Second Phase, 1977–1994 India’s first wave of insurgent violence ended badly for this domestic left-wing extremist movement but did not eliminate the conditions inspiring the movement or all of those willing to hold to the Naxalite cause. The movement fractured into more than 40 separate small groups.37 Slowly—over the course of a decade—these groups began to remobilize and consolidate. Par\u0002ticularly in the southeastern Indian state of Adhra Pradesh, a new Naxalite organization called People’s War emerged. Its leader, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, sought a more efficient structure to boost morale, recruitment, and funding. By 1978 Naxalite peasant revolts had spread to the Karimnagar District of Telangana and Adilabad District of Adhra Pradesh. The major grievance was unpaid wages. Second-wave Naxalite insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early 1980s insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked North Telangana village and Dan\u0002dakaranya forests areas along the Adhra Pradesh and Orissa border.38 In 1985 Naxalite insurgents began ambushing police. After they killed a police sub-inspec\u0002tor in Warangal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh responded by creating a special task force called the Greyhounds to establish control in the seven worst affected districts. An elite anti-Naxalite commando unit that still exists today, the Greyhounds were drawn from within the Andhra Pradesh police forces and given special treatment. A 2,000-strong force in 2015, the Grey\u0002hounds were given preferred payment and training—better than federal or state paramilitary forces. They were also highly supported by the entire state police force. The Greyhounds played a minimal role in combatting the Naxalites during the second phase of the Maoist insurgency.39 12 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In 1987 the Naxalite political party (People’s War) and other Maoist groups in Andhra Pradesh were barred from elections after kidnapped government officials were exchanged for Naxalite prisoners. The ban was briefly lifted in 1991. In December of that year, however, insur\u0002gent attacks increased. Affected states responded by establishing special laws that enabled police to focus on capture, detention, and extra-normal means of violence against Naxalite cadres— fighters and presumed supporters.40 Adhra Pradesh and Orissa invited additional central para\u0002military forces in Telangana to augment state and federal government security forces already there. Besides brute force, the state set up rival mass organizations to attract youth away from the Naxalites, started rehabilitation programs, and established new informant networks.41 The new counterinsurgency strategy reduced violent incidents, and nearly 9,000 Naxalites surrendered. Consequently in 1994 the ban on ostensibly moderate Naxalite political parties was lifted.42 The second wave of the Naxalite insurgency had been stopped. However, and as at the end of the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency, the socioeconomic conditions underpin\u0002ning Naxalism remained largely unchanged in many regions of eastern India. Third Phase, 2004–2015 From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s the Naxalite insurgency remained largely out of the public eye, but the movement had not gone away. Taking advantage of rising local support for violent response to economic conditions, fragmented Naxalite groups created a united front: the People’s War, Party Unity, and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) combined to form the People’s War Group (PWG). Naxalism manifested itself in episodic spurts of violence by the PWG, which had its most pronounced presence in Adhra Pradesh. From 1999–2002, local level violence increased. The PWG accelerated attacks on state government locations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. By 2000 an estimated 3,000 armed Naxalite rebels were re\u0002portedly active in India’s east.43 During this time, Indian government agencies took actions that accelerated grievances among the poor and displaced with sympathies for left-wing violence. First, economic growth and development led to local and state government appropriation of land for infrastructure and resource development, displacing many underprivileged people who had no political voice. Second, governments responded to Naxalite violence with acute violence, reportedly includ\u0002ing the extra-judicial murder and torture of suspected rebels and rebel families.44 The MCC intensified its campaign of violence against Indian security forces and government agencies in 2002–2003 after its leader was killed by police.45 13 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In 2004, the PWG was superseded by the CPI-M.46 From this 2004 merger of the two larg\u0002est Naxalite factions—the PWG and MCC—into the CPI-M, Maoist ideology was fused with a cadre of armed groups for the first time.47 A third and more lethal wave of violence—more sophisticated and more destructive—rapidly spread throughout eastern India. Naxalite leaders expanded control over natural resource rich areas (for example, coal, gas, precious minerals, and timber). They also collected taxes and extortion money to fund weapons production, including the production of crude but effective improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Estimates from 2004 to 2011 suggest the Naxalites extracted at least $18.4 million annually from government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.They embarked upon more choreographed terror campaigns including the murder of local politicians, overwhelming attacks on local police sta\u0002tions, impressment of child soldiers, and a general campaign to scare away outside investors. By the second half of 2005, Naxalites demonstrated a lethality and reach far beyond the capacity of other domestic terrorist and insurgent groups. They destroyed buildings, captured weapons, and killed several local policemen in an attack on a village in Uttar Pradesh. They also attacked the Jehanabad Prison in Bihar, killing two, freeing more than 300 inmates, and abduct\u0002ing about 30 inmates who were members of an anti-Naxalite group. Total deaths from Naxalite\u0002attributed insurgency and terrorism grew to more than 800 in the impacted east and north\u0002eastern regions.48 In 2006 and 2007, this trend expanded. In 2006, Naxalite groups launched several high-profile attacks against civilians and security forces, expanding the rural territory under Maoist control and under threat of extreme violence. In one event, an attack by some 800 armed Naxalites in Chhattisgarh killed 25, injured 80 more, and saw some 250 people declared missing.49 In 2006, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh grew concerned about the mounting threat posed by Naxalite groups to internal stability and democratic traditions across the east and southeast of India. The Naxalite menace had grown such that 18 of India’s federal states and 194 of its total districts were effected by Naxalite violence. For the first time Prime Minister Singh called the Naxalite/Maoist insurgency and associated terrorism “the sin\u0002gle biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”50 In 2007 Naxalite and Maoist violence reached an apex where it would remain for the next 4 years through 2010 (see map 2). Over 971 Naxalite attacks were recorded in the first seven months of 2007. That number would grow to over 1,500 attacks by the end of the year (see table51). Left-wing extremists began target\u0002ing elected officials including a member of the Indian parliament from Jharkhand state and the son of a former chief minister (or governor) of Andhra Pradesh.52 By 2010 the Naxalites were active in nine Indian states and reported to have a strong foot\u0002hold in parts of seven: West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, 14 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 and Maharashtra. This region happened to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric power potential. Across these states there were more than 2,200 incidents of Naxalite violence and almost 1,200 killed in 2010 alone (table).53 Map 2. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2007 15 India’s Naxalite Insurgency The threat to Indian national interests became obvious to the federal government and more co\u0002ordinated actions followed. From 2005 through 2010, Naxalite violence and the insufficient state-led, federally sup\u0002ported efforts to counter it cost India an average of more than 700 deaths per year. Most of these individuals were classified as civilian (see appendix A). Recruited from the disaffected rural poor, Naxalite cadres grew by 2010 to an estimated 20,000 armed fighters and an additional 50,000 supporters.54 In 2010, as he had first done in 2006, Prime Minister Singh trumpeted the risks of Naxalite violence to the stability and the ever important economic growth for the country. In May of that year, Prime Minister Singh referred to Naxalism as the “biggest internal security challenge” India has ever faced.55 The national government was understandably frustrated. From January to June 2009, India witnessed over 1,100 Naxalite-generated incidents of violence. These would double by the end of 2009 (table). Major violence occurred during national elections held from April to May 2009 as Naxalites called for an election boycott, attacked polling places, set off land mines, and even took control of a region of West Bengal known as Lalgarh. Paramilitary and police response operations against Naxalite locations were largely unsuccessful.56 Naxalite atrocities gained national notoriety. But simultaneously, accusations of systematic local police brutality and local and federal police human rights abuses against innocent civilians grew more vocal throughout the affected zones.57 In 2010 Naxalite violence inflicted 9 separate states of India and over 200 individual districts.58 Year 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 All Incidents 1,088 1,091 1,136 1,415 1,760 2,212 2,258 1,591 1,565 1,509 1,608 1,533 Attacks on Police 118 155 143 135 131 230 250 192 N/A 210 194 N/A Total Deaths 251 280 376 321 532 1,138 907 648 650 685 846 636 N/A = specific data not available Sources: “Left Wing Extremist (LWE) Data,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of Naxal Violence During 2008 to 2012,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of LWE Violence During 2011 to 2016 (up to 31.03.2016),” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs, “Annual Reports,” available at. Table. Major Incidents During Naxalite Insurgency, Third Phase 16 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In March 2010, after months of prevarication and confusion, the national government launched Operation Green Hunt. The initiative added an additional estimated 20,000 federal paramilitary troops, mainly from the CRPF battalions, to existing state, local, and already pres\u0002ent Ministry of Home Affairs forces from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Forc\u0002es, and Shashastra Seema Bal.59 (See appendix B for detail on MHA special police units.) The operation sent federal, state, and local police and paramilitary forces into former no-go zones deep in the forests of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states to rid them of militants, but these operations struggled. In April 2010, Naxalite insurgents ambushed 80 troops of the Indian Cen\u0002tral Police Security Forces (CPSF) in Chhattisgarh, killing an estimated 75 in the worst attack on Indian security forces since the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency began.60 In February 2011 Naxalites kidnapped two Indian government officials, demanding a halt to Green Hunt. The government agreed. The Naxalites also demanded the release of seven top imprisoned lead\u0002ers in exchange for the two officials. After a May 2011 Naxalite attack, 10 bodies of policemen were found dismembered in dense forest.61 Despite the major setbacks of 2010–2011, Indian federal and state authorities made some headway against a Naxalite insurgency now generating international headlines.62 Better coordi\u0002nated joint federal-state anti-Naxalite security operations killed a prominent Naxalite military leader, Koteswara Rao, in a November 2011 operation. In 2012 government paramilitary and police operations in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh began to produce results, with more than 1,800 Naxalite insurgents reported arrested and another 440 surrendered during the year.63 In late 2012 several Naxalite regional military leaders were captured and killed in those provinces. Acts of extreme violence continued during 2012 and 2013, but the expanse of the insur\u0002gency began to abate. Insurgency-related fatalities declined in 2012 and remained below 400 in 2013 (table). West Bengal reported sharp declines in Naxalite presence and activities dur\u0002ing 2013, although some observers declared that the decline in those states was offset by a corresponding increase of Naxalite violence in neighboring states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (appendix A). The Naxalites began the practice of including booby-trapping the bodies of dead Indian soldiers with IEDs in their stomachs. They killed national Congressman, and an\u0002ti-Naxalite militia Salwa Judum founder, Mahendra Karma in an attack on his convoy while he was campaigning for election in rural Chhattisgarh communities. Prime Minister Singh called for a two-pronged approach to dismantle the Naxalite network: sustaining joint and proactive military operations with greater economic development and responsible governance programs in the areas with strongest Maoist support. The CRPF successfully launched a 5-day interstate offensive in late December 2013 to dismantle core Maoist groups.64 It shut down a gun manu- 17 India’s Naxalite Insurgency facturing factory and recovered numerous weapons and explosives. Remote triggering devices were also found, indicating that the insurgency was using more advanced weaponry. By 2014 fatalities from Naxalite violence dropped below 300 for the first time in more than a decade (table). Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh remained most affected by the violence, and some Naxalite groups conducted operations and expanded into southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka states. But a review of the map in 2013 of Naxalite-impacted areas revealed a significant drop in the overall number of affected districts since 2007—from 165 to 120 overall—and an even more significant drop in districts categorized as experiencing severe or moderate amounts of violence from Naxalite activities over the same period—from 69 dis\u0002tricts in 2007 to just 28 in 2013 (see map 3). Eighty percent of Naxalite violence now afflicted only three states of India, down from the nine states impacted by serious Naxalite violence in 2010. On balance the tide had turned. By the end of 2014 the Naxalite insurgency was down if not out.65 In 2015, Indian joint security and economic efforts to counter the remaining Naxalite threat focused on 30 key districts in these 3 most impacted states, enabling more concentrated efforts matching gradually applied paramilitary enforcement with legal reforms and develop\u0002ment activities.66 As in the first two waves of Naxalite insurgency, the Indian federal-state government dis\u0002connect hampered its counterinsurgency efforts throughout the 2000s. Under the Indian con\u0002stitution, states bear the responsibility for enforcing law and order. When required, however, the federal government can send police and—under more limited conditions—military troops. In the case of federal police, assistance can come only upon request from the state government. In the case of military troops, assistance can come in the event of a state of emergency declara\u0002tion—as during the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency. Throughout the period from 2000 to 2010, the federal and state home (interior) ministries supervised multiple police and intelligence agencies without much unity of effort or command. An operation against Naxalite groups in the state of Bihar early in the 2000s faltered. Federal paramilitary border security forces in seven districts helped the local police, and millions of ru\u0002pees were promised in economic development opportunities. But the economic promises were broken, and poorly coordinated security operations only further alienated Naxalite moderates, derailing hoped for results by early 2002. In advance of 2004 elections in Chhattisgarh, the fed\u0002eral government sent 180 companies of paramilitary forces armed with helicopters and other advanced equipment. The Naxalites disappeared. Once the elections were over, federal troops and equipment departed and the Naxalites returned. 18 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 From the 2004 merger of Naxalite groups, the Indian government, particularly at the federal level, applied both carrots and sticks, incentivizing insurgents to pick constitutional remedies and brutally punishing those who refused. But the splits between state and federal authorities limited effectiveness. In part, state and local governments saw themselves in a co\u0002nundrum; they wanted an end to the organized Naxalite violence targeting them, their infra\u0002Map 3. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2013 19 India’s Naxalite Insurgency structure, and their legal enforcement structure. However, they did not want to alienate the vote banks across their states who sympathized with the Naxalite view of economic injustice but did not actively participate in violence. In one notable but far from unique instance, the chief minister (or governor) of the Naxalite-wracked state of Jharkhand won election in 2009 with strong insurgent sympathizer and insurgent vote bank support.67 State-level leaders de\u0002sired greater economic support from the central government, not overwhelming force, as the primary means to redress deeply held communist sympathies in their vote constituencies. Na\u0002tional political leaders within the INC empathized with these state-level concerns, offering some economic support and some additional policing support—but too little of either to make significant headway prior to 2010–2011. The politics of left-wing issues and voter concerns made effective coordination of counterinsurgency versus the Naxalites difficult. It took the extensive violence and loss of life between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate the failure of an ill-coordinated approach. In 2009 the central government signaled that it wanted to provide 80,000 paramilitary and federal police to help in the fight, but these were too slowly fed into the region without strong local coordination. From the desperation of the peak year of Naxalite (CPI-Maoist) violence in 2010, and then–Prime Minister Singh’s second declaration that Maoist violence was India’s most grave internal security threat, a combination of state\u0002level requests and federal-level policy improvements paved the way for late-arriving successes against the Naxalites.68 The path to success was also paved by corresponding Naxalite failures. Beginning in 2010, the Indian federal government finally undertook several successful ini\u0002tiatives that slowly but steadily spanned the coordination gap between federal and state security forces and linked with improved local economic development aid.69 First, the government took steps to increase the costs to Maoist insurgent group operations—both financial and physical. Second, the central government deployed an additional 66 federal paramilitary security battal\u0002ions, CPSF and others, into the field where the insurgency had been winning against small and poorly trained local police. As noted above, these came slowly and in tranches between 2010 and 2014 but reached an impressive number of more than 200,000 by early 2014.70 India’s mili\u0002tary and its special operations forces (SOF) have not participated directly in the third phase of Naxalite counterinsurgency operations. Instead, SOF units have provided indirect assistance— offering specialized training to Indian Central Armed Police Forces (see appendix B) preparing to deploy to the anti-Maoist counterinsurgency fight.71 Third, the federal government built 444 new police stations in affected areas and regenerated the policing capability in them.72 Fourth, the government established a civil development program in the worst affected areas. Finally, government security forces worked more effectively in a combined action environment where 20 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 economic development and human rights were established in the communities most vulnerable to Naxalite recruiting and propaganda.73 These five national factors interacted with several organizational failures by the Naxalites themselves. First, the Maoists failed to generate a message of systematic economic exploitation to the degree necessary for serious attention in Indian urban areas, where the gulf between rich and poor was great and growing every year. Second, despite their highly publicized violence, the Naxalites never won the “mindspace” in India; the Maoist ideology of class conflict gener\u0002ated limited appeal outside of primitive and tribal areas in India, never resonating in urban ar\u0002eas other than with a marginalized group of activist university students.74 Indian youth moved onto other causes and other areas of activism in the wider Indian economy.75 Third, Naxalites proved to be their own worst enemies. They often splintered into criminal syndicates deal\u0002ing narcotics and running both extortion and kidnapping rackets. This profiteering, evident from as early as 2009–2010, revealed that Naxalism was less about communist ideology or well-coordinated violent insurgent activity and much more about local and regional organized criminal activity, which exploits rather than benefits the lower class (and lower caste) Indian Hindus who live there.76 In self-reflective statements, ministry-level officials in the Indian federal government ac\u0002knowledged that most Naxalite gains before 2010 had come too often because local govern\u0002ments and security officials incorrectly assessed and mishandled the problems of the disgrun\u0002tled Indian minority groups in rural areas. At the same time the central government remained tepid in its involvement—unable to induce state governments to request more assertive federal security assistance and caught in a political conundrum where some of the state government leadership was both courting Naxalite sympathizer votes while simultaneously fighting Naxalite militant cadres. Once the federal government got serious and increased paramilitary security presence with a wider number of local economic development programs, the Naxalites began to wane.77 Attention to a holistic approach by the Indian central government caused the worst of the Naxalite insurgency to recede in a visible manner.78 In 2016 the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India remains a security factor, but one far from the menace publicly announced by then–Prime Minister Singh in 2006 and again in 2010.79 Instead it is now much more of a nuisance, largely a constellation of organized criminal enter\u0002prises with a loose affiliation to a Maoist credo than an ideological insurgency. The socioeco\u0002nomic factors that inspire Naxalite groups remain in place, and this insurgency could again evolve into a more serious threat to local security agents in India. In the poor eastern districts of India, the possibility of a fourth wave of Naxalite insurgency cannot be dismissed if the rich 21 India’s Naxalite Insurgency continue to get richer without the benefits of economic growth filtering down to the people who really need it.80 India’s long slog toward corralling the third phase of its Naxalite insurgency again demon\u0002strated the challenges and strengths of its counterinsurgency framework. State and local govern\u0002ment police forces must fail obviously and admit to their failures before major federal assistance can come forward. Left-wing (or communist) inspired violence mixes awkwardly with Indian electoral politics in many eastern states of the country. Communist political party voters often sympathize with Naxalite grievances but not their violent means. State and local officials thus have incentives to take uncertain and indecisive action with their police and security forces. Too often, they can tolerate incompetence and even human rights abuses by local-level counterin\u0002surgency police and militias, exacerbating wider grievances. They appeal for national economic help while avoiding national security help out of a fear that too much outside intervention might harm their local political interests. Federal-level forces, when these do arrive, come with their own issues. They can lack local knowledge and fail to be sensitive to popular culture and traditions. This leaves them vulnerable to insurgent ambush and to charges of torture or human rights abuses from an uncertain or frightened local population. U.S. Security Engagement with Indian Ministry of Home Affairs U.S. engagement with India in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has developed over a 16-year period from January 2000. This engagement has advanced along three parallel lines of interaction. One line has been through bilateral dialogue and exercises between U.S. and Indian SOF, which have focused on counterterrorism training events and conversa\u0002tions. A second line has been through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This collaboration has focused on criminal investigative techniques; port, rail, and maritime security training and best practices; and a general growth in liaison and information exchange between respective special police and border security agencies. A third line of interaction has evolved in more general bilateral military-to-military exchanges between the national armies, navies, air forces, and coast guards. Advancements in each of these areas have been noteworthy but not comprehensive. For all the noteworthy advances, limitations have remained, especially when it comes to the matter of outside assistance for Indian units and organizations conducting domestic counterinsurgency. The history of special operations training and exercising is most noteworthy. Bilateral U.S.- Indian SOF have undertaken joint exercises that work on interoperability in counterterror\u0002ism and counterinsurgency operation skills and drills. Small-scale counterterrorism training 22 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 exercises have been conducted on a recurring basis since 2002, including exercises in India’s northeast territories where longstanding domestic insurgencies continue.81 Under the broad definition of U.S.-India maritime security cooperation, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) SOF also have been training Indian military special forces officers in counterterrorism, learning from Indian counterterrorism experiences at the same time. In the main, these exercises have focused upon special techniques and capabilities for SOF activities in counterterrorism opera\u0002tions (see appendix C). Despite a decade of offers by U.S. senior commanders and defense officials, Indian leaders declined to have U.S. SOF engage with or provide direct assistance to the MHA paramilitary and police forces optimized for domestic counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations.82 But in October 2015, India, for the first time, welcomed U.S. SOF to a joint training exercise with its MHA counterterrorism unit, the National Security Guards (NSG).83 This was a meaningful step forward and, as most observers believe, became possible only after the change in perspective ac\u0002companying the government of Prime Minister Modi. Yet the limit of U.S. SOF interaction with that of only the NSG—the single special police unit focused on counterterrorism rather than counterinsurgency operations—is telling. After more than a decade of U.S. offers, the Indian government still remains uncomfortable about direct bilateral counterinsurgency training with its large array of MHA domestic counterinsurgency forces. Washington and New Delhi first established the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Work\u0002ing Group (JWG) in January 2000. Among more than a dozen major steps, the United States and India initiated antiterrorism training programs for Indian law enforcement officials and began a dialogue on cooperation in homeland and internal security.84 First, these programs involved lim\u0002ited military-to-military counterterrorism engagements. Then, after the November 2008 Mum\u0002bai terrorist attack, a more formal set of interactions between DHS and MHA counterterrorism and law enforcement officials began to take shape. Notably, however, neither of these lines of engagement have witnessed the MHA welcoming direct U.S. military or special police assistance for its special police or border police engaged in combating the Naxalite insurgency. In September 2005, USPACOM conducted a counterterrorism tabletop exercise that brought together Indian and American military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitari\u0002an assistance leaders. A U.S. National Guard unit co-trained with Indian troops at India’s Coun\u0002ter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram. U.S. antiterrorism assistance advanced again after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the commercial district of Mumbai. The U.S. Department of State’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) provided enhanced training 23 India’s Naxalite Insurgency consultations with senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials on the topics of hotel security, rail security, responses to an active shooter incident, as well as major event security management.85 In 2010, the two governments began the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Since then the dialogue has enabled bilateral cooperation on mutual strategic interests and strengthened “security cooperation through expanded dialogues and exercises as well as shar\u0002ing of advanced technologies.”86 A subsequent 2010 U.S.-India Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative allows the United States to facilitate capacity-building and training in India across a number of specific areas, including but not limited to: ■ developing investigative skills ■ promoting cooperation between forensic science laboratories ■ establishing procedures to provide mutual investigative assistance ■ improving capabilities to act against money-laundering, counterfeit currency, and terrorist financing ■ trading best practices on mass transit and rail security ■ increasing interactions between coast guards and navies on maritime security ■ exchanging experience and expertise on port and border security ■ enhancing liaison and training between specialist counterterrorism units, including the National Security Guard and its U.S. counterparts.87 Beginning in February 2012, American trainers under the ATA have been training Indian police in cooperation with the MHA. This training includes forensic examination of terrorist crime scenes and advanced explosives incident countermeasures. These courses are also available to state police, for example, in Kolkata (West Bengal). Intelligence agencies of both countries are sharing resources to support specific counterterrorism operations.88 These training courses have had a positive impact upon hundreds of Indian local and national police, including IPS. They have also engaged some members of the MHA special police units such as the Indo-Tibetan Bor\u0002der Police and CPSF. Noteworthy and prudent, these bits of individual training have occurred 24 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 with individual Indian police and paramilitary officers and jawans (junior paramilitary soldiers) who have later participated in counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites and other rebel groups.89 At the same time, though, direct U.S. military engagement with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and security forces units involved in domestic counterinsurgency has remained limited. American military interactions with regular Indian army units also have grown in an im\u0002pressive manner over the past decade. As discussed earlier, Indian, just as American, military and defense leaders are keen to state that India has more joint military training events and exer\u0002cises with the United States than with any other defense partner worldwide.90 Yet India’s civilian defense establishment leadership appears amenable to many military-to-military training and exercise interactions with the United States but continues to view access to military technology to be the litmus test of fruitful bilateral defense relations.91 Although the Indian military highly prizes joint service-to-service interactions and exer\u0002cises, no U.S. military units have been engaged with or even indirectly assisted Indian central police or paramilitary units directly involved in the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the Naxalites. In those instances in which the U.S. military and DHS per\u0002sonnel have had interaction with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and paramilitary forces, the rule has been that indirect general skills training is acceptable for Indian leadership, but specific engagement and activities directly with Indian domestic insurgency forces is alto\u0002gether something else. Some analysts have recommended that the United States formally inject direct domestic counterinsurgency assistance into the U.S.-India security relationship. In 2013, one such ana\u0002lyst, Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, made a robust proposal, stating that the United States should formally generate a $400 million India counterinsurgency initiative, jointly run by the Depart\u0002ment of Defense (DOD), State, and DHS.92 He proposed that this initiative should bundle to\u0002gether the indirect assistance provided by the ATA and DOD International Military Education and Training program, as well as establish a Foreign Military Finance Account for India (where one then did not exist) and apportion other money into DHS and Justice department accounts to better enable Federal Bureau of Information resources for its India-focused international po\u0002lice training program. In this well-intentioned recommendation, U.S. largesse could be used to provide vital equipment to India’s CRPF, including armored personnel vehicles, mine-resistant vehicles, flak jackets, GPS trackers, and night-vision goggles. As Indian attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deemed vital for providing counterinsurgency ground 25 India’s Naxalite Insurgency support, this proposal provided for U.S. funding to assist the Indian air force in creating dedi\u0002cated air surveillance and support for the CRPF—including helicopter and UAV support.93 Noble in intent, Mullick’s recommendation of a major U.S. push to provide direct assis\u0002tance to Indian domestic counterinsurgency units and operations remains as misguided today as it was in 2013. Likewise, periodic offers by U.S. defense officials of direct U.S. military assis\u0002tance to Indian counterinsurgency forces are similarly well intentioned but off target.94 These and similar initiatives ultimately push unhelpfully against Indian protection of its absolute sov\u0002ereignty in domestic counterinsurgency operations. Moreover, even if India were to unexpect\u0002edly welcome direct U.S. military and whole-of-government support for its domestic counter\u0002insurgency activities, that very success would create significant problems for the growing but delicate U.S.-India security relationship. These problems are evident in the patterns observed during Indian counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites. Direct American support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations (such as those against the Naxalites) would quickly expose significant divergence between views in Washington and Indian cultural and political concerns with its domestic insurgents. First, In\u0002dians are historically tolerant of long, protracted counterinsurgency operations, including the four-and-a-half-decade Naxalite rebellion, a six-decade swirl of insurgency in northeast India, and the insurgency and rebellion extant in Jammu and Kashmir since 1947. American patience with such protracted counterinsurgency operations has not been a hallmark of its international ventures over the past century. Second, Indian domestic insurgencies have a political cadence and rhythm about them that is alien to American sensibilities. In all three phases of the Naxalite insurgency, state and local political dynamics played to Naxalite sympathizer vote banks, allowing insurgent activi\u0002ties to grow to an uncomfortable level. In the second phase and especially the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency, Indian national police and paramilitary assistance began with limited but targeted security help for local authorities that focused upon managing major events—like election security—but then quickly vanished. Only when the political calculus of local, state, and national officials aligned did coordinated and effective policing, paramilitary, and local as\u0002sistance programs come together. American patience with the dynamics of this Indian political rhythm would be sorely tried. Third, with much of India’s Naxalite insurgency featuring organized criminal activity as its underpinning by 2014–2016, it is arguably more useful and feasible for the United States and India to focus meaningful collaboration on individual policing techniques and investigative activities to counter these dimensions of residual Naxalism. There will be less Indian resistance 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 to this kind of DHS-to-MHA support. Thereafter, the focus of the U.S. military and its SOF can then better orient on wider regional and international counterterrorism activities. In addition to these historically supported cautions, direct American training and equip\u0002ment support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations might run afoul of U.S. legisla\u0002tive mandates and human rights standards. All U.S. assistance to foreign security forces must conform to what is known as the Leahy Law, named for legislative author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). One part of the law applies to State Department foreign assistance programs and the second applies to DOD training and assistance programs for the security forces of a foreign country. Both versions prohibit any U.S. security assistance if the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense have credible information that a military, paramilitary, or police unit of a foreign government has committed a gross violation of human rights in the conduct of its activities— past or present. The law allows for an exception (or waiver) permitting resumption of security assistance if the Secretary of State or Defense reports to Congress that the government of the assisted country is taking effective steps to bring the violating members of the security forces to justice.95 Direct U.S. assistance to India’s paramilitary and police units combatting the Naxalite insurgency (as others) could quickly run into a problem with the Leahy Law. There have been frequent reports of Indian local police units’ involvement in human rights violations against innocents in the Naxalite insurgency areas.96 Indian central policy forces, including units from the CRPF, have been accused of human rights abuses and torture against apprehended militants and presumed supporters in Naxalite-afflicted areas.97 It is hard to imagine Indian pride react\u0002ing well to American demands for certification of the human rights corrections made on its national counterinsurgency paramilitary forces. It also is hard to imagine the U.S.-India security relationship holding up well if, in order to secure training and equipment for its already well-supported national paramilitary units, New Delhi must face repetitive Leahy Law inquiries. Indeed, in a country with growing wealth and a proud belief in the relative successes of its autonomous, indigenous paramilitary counterin\u0002surgency forces, U.S. direct assistance (with strings) is not likely to be well received.98 At the least, such conditioned assistance would strain security relations that both sides desire to see improve. At the worst, the outcome might set back bilateral security progress on far more im\u0002portant U.S.-India security initiatives including those involving joint maritime security activi\u0002ties in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence sharing and broader operations. 27 India’s Naxalite Insurgency Lessons Learned and Policy Implications for U.S.-India Relations A review of the history of Indian approach to dealing with its Naxalite insurgency indi\u0002cates the unique nature of New Delhi’s approach to domestic security. The limited engagement with the United States on military and security assistance offers also indicates the continuing barriers inhibiting a deep and unbridled bilateral security alliance at this time. A decade of U.S. interaction with India on the Naxalite insurgency reinforces the notion that Washington should not expect New Delhi to become a tightly coupled military ally anytime soon. Instead, New Del\u0002hi is more likely to be a friendly strategic partner with the United States where mutual security interests align, while interacting more often in a restrained and limited manner where U.S. and Indian security interests and prerogatives do not well align—as in the case of the Naxalites.99 Given this insight, U.S. policymakers should focus on bilateral counterterrorism and coun\u0002terinsurgency security cooperation efforts toward externally sponsored Islamist terrorist groups and, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, against actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns. As a complement, U.S. military assistance programs focusing on technical skills and practices for individual Indian police, paramilitary, and SOF will remain most promising and prominent for the foreseeable future. 28 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Appendix A.

Under the reciprocal agreement, both New Delhi and Washington would have the ability, but not the obligation, to assist each other’s armed forces with simple military logistics. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India.

On May 22, there were nearly simultaneous bombings of two movie theaters in New Delhi by a Sikh terrorist organization, Babbar Khalsa International, which many thought was defunct. The attacks left 1 person dead and more than 60 injured. On October 29, a series of explosions in crowded marketplaces and on a public bus in New Delhi killed approximately 60 and injured more than 150 on the eve of Diwali, India’s most important Hindu holiday. The Indian government blamed the designated foreign terrorist organiza\u0002tion Lashkar e-Tayyiba for the attack.

But it also came about after Naxalite groups began to focus on controlling areas rich in natural resources such as iron and destroying state infrastructure such as railroads, telephone exchanges, and industrial plants. By 2010 Naxalite presence overlapped critical areas such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Orissa, which contain the bulk of India’s iron ore, and Andhra Pradesh has large reserves of bauxite, 38 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 key inputs to Indian industry. Naxalites had also come to dominate areas containing 85 percent of the country’s coal resources, which are used to power 55 percent of India’s energy supply and 75 percent of its electricity. These economic realities made piecemeal solutions and state-level toleration of Naxalite activities untenable—driving better coordination. See “Left Wing Extremism (LWE) Division,” available at.

Most recently, U.S. congressional conditionality on the Kerry-Berman-Lugar strategic assistance package to Pakistan of 2009 requiring that Pakistan’s military relinquish absolute control of its general officer selection process to civilian oversight substantially strained U.S.-Pakistan relations at a moment that Washington aimed to make them tighter. India in 2016 is not Pakistan of 2009, but the caution against unhelpful conditionality remains a worthy one. See S. 1707, “Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009,” 111th Cong., 1st sess.

The 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) is the 40th report in an annual series that highlights significant foreign barriers to U.S. exports, U.S. foreign direct investment, and U.S. electronic commerce. This document is a companion piece to the President’s 2025 Trade Policy Agenda and 2024 Annual Report, published by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on February 28, 2025. In accordance with Section 181 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by Section 303 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 and amended by Section 1304 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Section 311 of the Uruguay Round Trade Agreements Act, and Section 1202 of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, USTR is required to submit to the President, the Senate Finance Committee, and appropriate committees in the House of Representatives, an annual report on significant foreign trade barriers. The statute requires an inventory from the previous calendar year of the most important foreign barriers affecting U.S. exports of goods and services, including agricultural commodities and U.S. intellectual property; foreign direct investment by U.S. persons, especially if such investment has implications for trade in goods or services; and U.S. electronic commerce. Such an inventory enhances awareness of these trade restrictions, facilitates U.S. negotiations aimed at reducing or eliminating these barriers, and is a valuable tool in enforcing U.S. trade laws and promoting U.S. economic and security interests. The NTE Report is based upon information compiled within USTR, the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Agriculture, and other U.S. Government agencies, as well as U.S. embassies and supplemented with information provided in response to a notice published in the Federal Register, and by the trade advisory committees. This Report discusses the largest export markets for the United States, covering nearly 60 trading partners. Omission of particular trading partners and barriers does not imply that they are not of concern to the United States. Trade barriers elude fixed definitions, but may be broadly defined as government laws, regulations, policies, or practices—including non-market policies and practices—that distort or undermine fair competition. These include measures that protect domestic goods and services from foreign competition, artificially stimulate exports of particular domestic goods and services, or fail to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights. Non-market policies and practices, such as targeting of industrial sectors for dominance, non-market excess capacity, and distorting activities of state-owned or state- sponsored firms, may create economic and national security risks and undermine U.S. competitiveness. The purpose of the NTE Report is to identify barriers the U.S. Government seeks to remove. The NTE Report classifies foreign trade barriers in 14 categories. These categories cover measures and policies that restrict, prevent, or impede the international exchange of goods and services, U.S. foreign direct investment, or U.S. electronic commerce. The categories covered include: • Import policies (e.g., tariffs and other import charges, quantitative restrictions, import licensing, customs barriers and shortcomings in trade facilitation, and other market access barriers); ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-9-2048.jpg) ![2 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS • Technical barriers to trade (e.g., unnecessarily trade restrictive standards, conformity assessment procedures, or technical regulations, including unnecessary or discriminatory technical regulations or standards for telecommunications products); • Sanitary and phytosanitary measures (e.g., measures that unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering safety objectives because they are applied beyond the extent necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, not based on science, or maintained without sufficient scientific evidence); • Government procurement (e.g., “buy national” policies and closed bidding); • Intellectual property protection (e.g., inadequate patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark regimes and inadequate enforcement of intellectual property rights); • Services barriers (e.g., prohibitions or restrictions on foreign participation in the market, discriminatory licensing requirements or regulatory standards, local-presence requirements, and unreasonable restrictions on what services may be offered); • Electronic commerce / digital trade barriers (e.g., barriers to cross-border data flows, discriminatory practices affecting trade in digital products, restrictions on the provision of Internet-enabled services, and other restrictive technology requirements); • Investment barriers (e.g., limitations on foreign equity participation and on access to foreign government-funded research and development programs, local content requirements, technology transfer requirements and export performance requirements, and restrictions on repatriation of earnings, capital, fees and royalties); • Subsidies, including export subsidies (e.g., export financing on preferential terms and agricultural export subsidies that displace U.S. exports in third country markets) and import substitution subsidies (e.g., subsidies contingent on the purchase or use of domestic rather than imported goods); • Anticompetitive practices (e.g., government-tolerated anticompetitive conduct of state-owned or private firms that restricts the sale or purchase of U.S. goods or services in the foreign country’s markets or abuse of competition laws to inhibit trade, and fairness and due process concerns by companies involved in competition investigatory and enforcement proceedings in the country); • State-owned enterprises (e.g., actions by SOEs and by governments with respect to SOEs involved in the manufacture or production of non-agricultural goods or in the supply of services that constitute significant barriers to, or distortions of, U.S. exports of goods and services, U.S. investments, or U.S. electronic commerce, which may negatively affect U.S. firms and workers. These actions include subsidies and non-commercial advantages provided to and from SOEs and practices with respect to SOEs that discriminate against U.S. goods or services, or actions by SOEs that are inconsistent with commercial considerations in the purchase and sale of goods and services); ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-10-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 3 • Labor (e.g., concerns with failures by a government to protect internationally recognized worker rights1 or to eliminate discrimination in respect of employment or occupation, in cases where these failures influence trade flows or investment decisions in ways that constitute significant barriers to, or distortions of, U.S. exports of goods and services, U.S. investment, or U.S. electronic commerce, which may negatively affect U.S. firms and workers); • Environment (e.g., concerns with a government’s levels of environmental protection, unsustainable stewardship of natural resources, and harmful environmental practices that constitute significant barriers to, or distortions of, U.S. exports of goods and services, U.S. investment, or U.S. electronic commerce, which may negatively affect U.S. firms or workers); and • Other barriers (e.g., barriers or distortions that are not covered in any other category above or that encompass more than one category, such as bribery and corruption, or that affect a single sector). Pursuant to Section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, USTR annually reviews the operation and effectiveness of U.S. telecommunications trade agreements to make a determination on whether any foreign government that is a party to one of those agreements is failing to comply with that government’s obligations or is otherwise denying, within the context of a relevant agreement, “mutually advantageous market opportunities” to U.S. telecommunication products or services suppliers. The NTE Report highlights both ongoing and emerging barriers to U.S. telecommunication services and goods exports from the annual review called for in Section 1377. The prevalence of corruption is a consistent complaint from U.S. firms that trade with or invest in other economies. Corruption takes many forms and affects trade and development in different ways. In many countries and economies, it affects customs practices, licensing decisions, and the award of government procurement contracts. If left unchecked, bribery and corruption can negate market access gained through trade negotiations, frustrate broader reforms and economic stabilization programs, and undermine the foundations of the international trading system. The United States continues to play a leading role in addressing bribery and corruption in international business transactions and has made real progress over the past quarter century building international coalitions to fight bribery and corruption. IMPACT OF FOREIGN BARRIERS ON U.S. TRADE Wherever possible, this report presents estimates of the impact on U.S. exports, U.S. foreign direct investment, or U.S. electronic commerce of specific foreign trade barriers and other trade distorting practices. Where consultations related to specific foreign practices were proceeding at the time of this report’s publication, estimates were excluded in order to avoid prejudice to these consultations. The estimates included in this report constitute an attempt to quantitatively assess the potential effect of removing certain foreign trade barriers to particular U.S. exports. However, the estimates cannot be used to determine the total effect on U.S. exports, either to the country in which a barrier has been identified, or to the world in general. In other words, the estimates contained in this report cannot be aggregated in order to derive a total estimate of gain in U.S. exports to a given country or the world. To provide further statistical context for the reader, Appendix II reports the most recent U.S. Government statistical data on U.S. bilateral trade in goods, U.S. bilateral trade in services, and U.S. bilateral foreign direct investment in rank order. 1 Internationally recognized worker rights include the right of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor, a minimum age for the employment of children, and a prohibition on the worst forms of child labor, and acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-11-2048.jpg) ![4 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Trade barriers or other trade distorting practices affect U.S. exports to foreign markets, as they effectively impose costs on U.S. exports that are not imposed on goods produced in the importing market. These unfair trade practices undermine U.S. exporters’ competitiveness and, in some cases, prevent U.S. goods from entering the foreign market entirely. In theory, estimating the impact of a foreign trade measure on U.S. exports of goods requires knowledge of the (extra) cost the measure imposes on them, as well as knowledge of market conditions in the United States, in the country imposing the measure, and in third countries. In practice, such information often is not available. Where sufficient data exist, an approximate impact of tariffs on U.S. exports can be derived by obtaining estimates of supply and demand price elasticities in the importing country and in the United States. Typically, the U.S. share of imports is assumed constant. When no calculated price elasticities are available, reasonable postulated values are used. The resulting estimate of lost U.S. exports is approximate, depends on the assumed elasticities, and does not necessarily reflect changes in trade patterns with third countries. Similar procedures are followed to estimate the impact of subsidies that displace U.S. exports in third country markets. In some cases, stakeholder valuations estimating the financial effects of barriers are contained in the report. The methods for computing these valuations are sometimes uncertain. Hence, their inclusion in the NTE Report should not be construed as a U.S. Government endorsement of the estimates they reflect.

This Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Algeria. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Algeria is not a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) but is a WTO Observer. Goods imported into Algeria face a range of tariffs, from zero percent to 60 percent. Algeria’s average Most-Favored- Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 18.9 percent in 2022 (latest data available). Algeria’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 23.7 percent for agricultural products and 18.1 percent for non-agricultural products in 2022 (latest data available). Goods facing the highest rates are those for which equivalents are manufactured in Algeria. Citing the need to encourage local production and ease pressure on the country’s foreign exchange reserves, Algeria implemented temporary additional safeguard duties (DAPs) of 30 percent to 200 percent on a list of more than 1,000 manufactured and agricultural goods in April 2019, with the 200 percent rate applied to 10 tariff lines covering cement products under the Harmonized System heading 25.23. The items in Algeria’s customs code that remain duty free are generally European Union-origin goods that are used in manufacturing and are exempt from tariffs under the 2006 European Union–Algeria Association Agreement. Non-Tariff Barriers Quantitative Restrictions In November 2022, Algeria released a new Book of Specifications concerning the automotive industry (covering automobiles, buses, trucks, construction equipment, and motorcycles) that eliminates previous import quotas but requires import authorization. Due to customs duties, the VAT, and other taxes, vehicles cost more than double the market rate when purchased by individuals overseas and imported into Algeria. In November 2023, Algeria authorized 38 domestic automobile companies to import vehicles under the 2022 regime. A provision in the October 2022 Complementary Finance Law permits those residing in Algeria to import used cars that are three years old or less. In 2020, Algeria established a maximum annual import volume of 4 million metric tons of bread (common) wheat. The Algerian president announced in August 2021 that the state grains agency (OAIC) would be the country’s exclusive wheat importer to counteract alleged “illicit practices” by private importers. In practice, the OAIC was already the sole buyer of wheat, reselling the commodity on the domestic market at subsidized prices. In 2022, the Algerian president announced that the OAIC would have the exclusive right to import rice and pulses as well. However, Algeria has not codified the OAIC’s role as the sole buyer of wheat, rice, and pulses. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-13-2048.jpg) ![6 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Import Bans and Import Restrictions Since January 2009, Algeria’s Ministry of Health has restricted the importation of a number of generic pharmaceutical products and medical devices. Since 2007, Algeria has banned the importation of used medical equipment unless the government grants a special exception. Algeria has applied the regulation broadly to block the reimportation of machinery sent abroad for maintenance under warranty, even for equipment owned by state-run hospitals. Algeria bans the importation of most types of used machinery, except for refurbished assembly line equipment used in domestic industries. In February 2021, the Ministry of Commerce issued a schedule establishing a seasonal ban for individual agricultural products. The schedule adjusted a year-round restriction on almond imports to a seasonal ban covering June through August. Since October 2021, Algeria has restricted the importation of additional products for which there is minimal demand and for agricultural products not elsewhere specified or indicated in Algeria’s tariff schedule. Algeria justified these decisions as necessary to reduce the country’s import bill and to combat fraud. In August 2021, the Ministry of Finance instructed banks to suspend the processing of accounts for importers of products intended for resale starting at the end of October 2021, unless importers complied with a March 2021 decree requiring them to update their import registration to include only one category of product per company. The Ministry of Finance subsequently communicated implementation instructions to the Ministry of Commerce’s National Center of Commerce Registry (CNRC) but not to importers themselves. Importers must approach the CNRC individually to seek guidance regarding their particular situation rather than rely on publicly available information. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Many companies continue to face problems clearing goods through Algerian customs. Delays can take weeks or months, in many cases without explanation. In addition to a certificate of origin, the Algerian Government requires all importers to provide certificates of conformity and quality from an independent third party. Algerian customs requires that shipping documents be stamped with a “Visa Fraud” note from the Ministry of Commerce, indicating that the goods have passed a fraud inspection before the goods are cleared. Many importations also require authorizations from multiple ministries, which frequently cause additional delays, especially when the regulations do not clearly specify which ministry’s authority is being exercised. SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Algeria bans the production, importation, distribution, or sale of seeds that are the products of biotechnology. Biotechnology seeds imported for research purposes are excepted. Algeria maintains animal health certificate requirements for animals and animal products, dairy and dairy products, and processed products of animal origin. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development Services concluded a certificate for dairy breeding cattle in November 2024 and a certificate for U.S. bovine semen in September 2023. However, challenges with the recognition and approval of other certificates remain. In 2021 and again in 2023, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service submitted a letter requesting that Algeria accept the USDA 9060-5 export certificate for U.S. meat and poultry products. As ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-14-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 7 of December 31, 2024, USDA was awaiting a response from the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development Services. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Since August 2015, all ministries and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are required to purchase domestically manufactured products whenever available. Procurement of foreign goods is permitted only with special ministerial authorization and if a locally made product cannot be identified. Algeria requires approval from the Council of Ministers for expenditures in foreign currency that exceed DZD 10 billion (approximately $74 million). Algeria is not a Member of the WTO and, therefore, is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Algeria remained on the Watch List in USTR’s 2024 Special 301 Report. Algeria has taken some positive steps to improve intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, including by introducing a draft law to amend the IP regulatory framework, creating a new specialized commercial court responsible for adjudicating IP–and international trade-related disputes, and engaging in capacity building and training efforts for law enforcement, customs officials, judges, and IP protection agencies. However, concerns remain, including the lack of an effective mechanism for early resolution of potential pharmaceutical patent disputes, inadequate judicial remedies in cases of patent infringement, the lack of administrative opposition in Algeria’s trademark system, and the need to increase enforcement efforts against counterfeiting and piracy. In addition, there is a lack of clarity about whether Algeria’s system protects against the unfair commercial use or unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Algeria imposes a maximum value per transaction of DZD 100,000 (approximately $745) on citizens when using international credit cards to purchase goods from outside the country. In addition, Algerian foreign exchange regulations prohibit the use of online payment processors to transfer money from one account to another. In May 2018, Algeria enacted a law requiring electronic commerce platforms conducting business in Algeria to register with the government and to host their websites from a data center located in Algeria. Such localization requirements impose unnecessary costs on service suppliers by requiring redundant storage systems. Such requirements are disproportionately burdensome for small firms. INVESTMENT BARRIERS In its 2021 Finance Law, Algeria re-imposed the requirement that Algerian individuals or entities own at least 51 percent of all projects involving foreign investment (known as the 51/49 rule). The requirement applies retroactively to foreign companies already established in Algeria and owning more than 49 percent of operations in strategic sectors such as energy, mining, defense, transportation and infrastructure, and pharmaceuticals, as well as for activities involving raw materials and importers of goods for resale in Algeria. U.S. companies report that the 51/49 rule creates concerns related to their IP rights and financial control of the local venture. In July 2022, the Algerian Government enacted an investment law that called for the creation of Invest Algeria, a one-stop shop for prospective investors to register in-country. However, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-15-2048.jpg) ![8 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS as of 2024, Invest Algeria has not been established, and the Algerian Government has not provided further details as to when the initiative will be developed. The 2022 Book of Specifications for the automotive industry removed the mandate that automotive importers must be 100 percent Algerian-owned. However, importers of vehicles for resale are required to partner with an Algerian company. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) comprise about two-thirds of the Algerian economy by market value, and their procurements amount to 20 percent of gross domestic product. The national oil and gas company, Sonatrach, is the most prominent SOE, but SOEs are present in all sectors of the economy. SOEs leverage their position in the market to gain advantage over privately owned competitors. For example, state-owned telecommunications provider Algérie Télécom holds a monopoly over all undersea data cable traffic in and out of Algeria, offering services at a considerable advantage over private companies operating in the telecommunications sector. SOEs also have monopolies on activities such as the supply of electricity and water and the purchase and import of cereals and pulses. Several SOEs have weak balance sheets and require regular government financial assistance, partly due to activities such as selling products and services at below cost-recovery levels. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-16-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 9 ANGOLA TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Angola Trade and Investment Framework Agreement The United States and Angola signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) on May 19, 2009. This TIFA is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Angola. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Angola’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate for all products was 11 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Angola’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 21.5 percent for agricultural products and 9.3 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Angola has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 59.1 percent and average bound rates of 52.7 percent for agricultural products and 60.1 percent for non- agricultural products. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the General Tax Administration of Angola allowed all medicines and biosafety material to be imported duty free, as of March 27, 2020. In January 2024, Presidential Decree No. 1/24 outlined a revision of Angola’s customs tariffs to support Angola’s domestic production. The change in tariff rates applied to most products. The newly released tariff schedule increased import duties on many staple foods including milk (from 10 percent to 40 percent), rice (from duty-free to 20 percent), wheat flour (from 20 percent to 50 percent), vegetable oil (from 10 percent to 40 percent), palm oil (from 10 percent to 40 percent), and cane sugar (from 10 percent to 30 percent). Poultry and offal products, the United States’ leading agricultural export to Angola, were assessed with an import duty of 10 percent. The Angolan Government claimed the import duties were meant to encourage domestic production and discourage imports of goods produced in sufficient quantities in the local economy. However, economic analysts in Angola have warned about the risk of product shortages, as the country has been only self-sufficient in bananas and salt. Non-Tariff Barriers Quantitative Restrictions On April 12, 2024, Order No. 035/2024 authorized the opening of the Dynamic Electronic Procedure for Licensing Rice Imports and launched a public tender for rice imports; nine companies were selected. This public tender functioned as a quantitative restriction rather than a government purchase. The government did not appear to use public funds for a purchase but rather used this method to provide discretionary import permits to specific authorized importers to purchase set amounts while withholding import permits from all companies that were not selected under the public tender. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-17-2048.jpg) ![10 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Import Bans/ Restrictions On October 30, 2023, Angola issued Presidential Decree No. 213/23, which focuses on restricting imports to promote domestic production, primarily of agricultural products. The new decree seeks to encourage investment in local production by providing access to credit for domestic producers and processors. It also specifies that import authorization is conditioned on demonstrating that importers have attempted to enter into contracts with Angolan suppliers prior to importing products. The decree replaced and expanded the scope of products covered by the previous Presidential Decree No. 23/29 from 2019. The United States continues to raise this issue with Angola bilaterally and in the WTO Committee on Market Access, the WTO Committee on Import Licensing, and the WTO Committee on Agriculture. Additionally, on April 1, 2024, Presidential Decree No. 1/24 prohibited the importation of numerous products based on concerns including “environmental, moral, safety, protection of health and human life, animal and plant health, industrial, commercial, artistic, or historical and archaeological heritage.” The list of prohibited items included numerous lower cost offal products of poultry, pork, cattle, and other animals. In addition to the prohibition on lower cost items, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry suspended issuance of import permits for poultry and offal products that were not included in the schedule of prohibited products. These suspensions were made without official notice and have affected nearly 99 percent of U.S. agricultural exports to Angola. Customs Barriers Angola has not notified its customs valuation legislation to the WTO and has not yet responded to the Checklist of Issues describing how the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement is being implemented. SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Angola does not maintain an effective risk management program for veterinary and sanitary control purposes. Therefore, consignments of imports classified in Chapters 2 to 23 of the Harmonized System (including animal and vegetable products and foodstuffs) must be laboratory tested prior to importation into Angola and be accompanied by a health certificate. Agricultural Biotechnology Angola does not allow the use of agricultural biotechnology in production, and imports containing genetically engineered (GE) components are limited to food aid and scientific research. Angola also prohibits the importation of viable GE grain or seed. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry required importers to present documentation certifying that their goods do not include biotechnology products. Importation of GE food is permitted when it is provided as food aid, but the product must be milled before it arrives in Angola. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry allows biotechnology imports for scientific research, subject to regulation and controls. On July 16, 2024, the Government of Angola issued Presidential Decree No. 158/24, creating a Genetically Modified Seed Committee with the aim of establishing a national biosafety system with standards and inspection mechanisms to monitor and authorize the importation, cultivation, transit, investigation, and release of genetically modified seeds. The inter-ministerial committee was coordinated by the Minister of Agriculture and Forests and comprised the Minister of Health, the Minister of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation, the Minister of Environment, and the Minister of Industry and Commerce. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-18-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 11 GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Despite revisions to increase transparency in the Public Procurement Law that entered into force on January 22, 2021, simplified contracting or direct awards have continued to be the primary mechanism for public procurement transactions. Civil society and businesses noted that the government’s continued regular use of direct public contract awards through tenders by pre-qualification, closed bidding, or simplified contracting for a regular and select few companies without the use of public tenders in various sectors was detrimental to competition for foreign companies. In some instances, companies reported a lack of clarity in certain tender processes. Angola is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. OTHER BARRIERS Bribery and Corruption Levels of corruption and bribery have declined, but corruption remained prevalent in Angola due to a lack of uniform implementation of anticorruption laws and an inadequately trained civil service, among other reasons. The Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Codes (Law No. 38/20 and Law No. 39/20) on bribery and corruption entered into force on February 9, 2021. Notable changes include corporate criminal liability, harsh penalties for corruption of public officials, criminalization of private corruption, and provisions for seizure of proceeds of a crime, among others. The law also contains provisions that criminalize bribery of national and foreign public officials; seek an appropriate balance between immunities and the ability to effectively investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate offences; enhance cooperation within local law enforcement authorities; and, designate a central anticorruption authority. Enforcement of anticorruption laws remained inadequate. The United States and the international community have engaged in anticorruption initiatives to help Angola attain its anticorruption objectives. The U.S. Department of Treasury provided technical assistance to the Angola Central Bank (BNA) to increase capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. In June 2023, the Financial Action Task Force regional body, the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group, conducted an interim mutual evaluation report and identified fundamental weaknesses in Angola’s anti–money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) system. Deficiencies in AML/CFT cited include a lack of capacity in medium and small banks to implement targeted financial sanctions, a lack of bank capacity to determine the identity of the beneficial owner of accounts, and limited prosecutions for money laundering offenses. Foreign Exchange Angola’s dependence on oil and gas production meant that activity in the sector heavily influenced the availability of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange availability has improved in major economic sectors but remained inadequate for individuals and small and medium-sized businesses as a result of limited liquidity, which created delays and hurdles for the importation of goods and payment of services. As of December 2023, Angola’s currency had depreciated nearly 40 percent since the beginning of the year due to a shortage of U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market. The BNA issued Notice 3/2023 on March 1, 2023, stipulating that individual Angolans may transfer up to $250,000 abroad each year. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-19-2048.jpg) ![12 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS On December 28, 2023, the Angolan Government reintroduced the Special Contribution for Foreign Exchange Operations (CEOC), targeting transfers in foreign currency outside of Angola, as part of the 2024 budget law. This levy came into effect on January 1, 2024 and applied to transactions such as technical assistance, service provision, consultancy, management, or unilateral transactions, with rates that were set at 2.5 percent for individuals and 10 percent for legal entities. Exemptions from the CEOC included payments for health and education expenses (if paid directly to the institutions’ bank accounts), transfers of dividends, and repayments of loan capital and associated interest. The CEOC aimed to regulate foreign exchange operations more tightly, ensuring a fair contribution from transactions impacting Angola’s financial reserves. Business Licensing Law No. 26/21 of October 2021 transferred the authority to license business activity from provincial governments and municipal administrations to the Angolan President. The law also expanded business licensing eligibility. Commercial stakeholders have expressed concern that the transfer of authority could create dependence on higher governmental powers to authorize commercial activity. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-20-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 13 ARAB LEAGUE The 22 Arab League members are the Palestinian Authority and the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The effect of the Arab League’s boycott of Israeli companies and Israeli-made goods (originally implemented in 1948) on U.S. trade and investment in the Middle East and North Africa varies from country to country. Efforts by various Arab League members to enforce the boycott have had an extremely limited practical effect overall on U.S. trade and investment ties with many key Arab League countries. The U.S. Departments of Commerce and Treasury and the USTR monitor boycott policies and practices of Arab League members, and, aided by U.S. embassies, lend advocacy support to firms facing boycott-related pressures. On February 16, 2024, the U.S. Department of Treasury published the list of countries which require or may require participation in, or cooperation with, an international boycott (within the meaning of section 999(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). The list included Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen. Arab League members that implement boycotts that pose a potential barrier to the United States include: IRAQ: As a matter of policy, Iraq does not adhere to the Arab League boycott. Most Iraqi ministries and state-owned enterprises have agreed not to comply with or have rescinded regulations enforcing the boycott, following a 2009 Council of Ministers decision to cease boycott-related implementation practices. However, individual Iraqi Government officials and ministries continue to violate that policy. The Ministry of Health’s procurement arm (Kimadia) was among the government entities that still issued boycott-related requests. QATAR: Qatar has a boycott law, but the extent to which the government enforces it is unclear. Although Qatar renounced implementation of the boycott of U.S. firms that do business in Israel (the secondary and tertiary boycott) in 1994, U.S. firms and their subsidiaries continue to report receiving boycott-related requests from public Qatari companies. In those instances, U.S. companies have made efforts to substitute alternative language. YEMEN: Although Yemen renounced observance of the secondary and tertiary aspects of the boycott in 1995, in the years since, Yemen has continued to enforce the primary boycott and certain aspects of the secondary and tertiary boycotts. Ongoing political turmoil in the country has made it impossible to ascertain current official Yemeni attitudes toward the boycott. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-21-2048.jpg) ![14 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS ARGENTINA TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Argentina Trade and Investment Framework Agreement The United States and Argentina signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement on March 23, 2016. This Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Argentina. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs Argentina’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 13.4 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Argentina’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 10.3 percent for agricultural products and 13.8 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Argentina has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 31.8 percent. Argentina reduced tariff rates on 113 tariff lines between January and September 2024. In October 2023, Argentina raised the tariff rate on whisky to 35 percent, while the tariff on all other alcoholic beverages remains at 12 percent. Argentina is a founding member of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), formed in 1991, which also comprises Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. On July 5, 2024, Bolivia promulgated its law to become a full member, and it is in the process of incorporating MERCOSUR’s regulations. MERCOSUR’s Common External Tariff (CET) ranges from zero percent to 35.0 percent ad valorem. In July 2022, MERCOSUR countries agreed to a 10 percent reduction of the CET for over 80 percent of product lines. The decision reduced the block’s average CET to 10.3 percent and its weighted average to 9.5 percent. Any good imported into Argentina (not including free trade zones) is subject to the payment of the CET to Argentina’s customs authority. If the product is then re-exported to another MERCOSUR country, the CET must be paid again to the second country. MERCOSUR approved a Common Customs Code (CCC) in 2010 and launched a plan to eliminate the double application of the CET within MERCOSUR in 2021. However, only Argentina has ratified the CCC, therefore it has not yet taken effect. Taxes Argentina maintains a variety of taxes on, and tax exemptions for, imported goods. On December 23, 2019, the Argentine Congress passed Public Emergency Law 27541, raising to 3 percent the rate of the statistical tax, a fee charged on goods imported for consumption. Temporary imports, inputs used to produce goods for export, and imported goods for scientific and technological research are exempted from this tax. Pursuant to Decree 1140/2024, the 3 percent statistical tax rate was extended until December 31, 2027. Argentina’s tax collection processes burden imports by effectively requiring advance payment of income taxes. When goods are imported, Argentina collects a percentage of the value of imports as income tax withholding to be applied to the importer’s income taxes. In particular, an advance value-added tax (VAT), ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent, is paid by the importer, unless the goods are for personal use. In addition, the importer is responsible for an income tax withholding of 6 percent to 11 percent of the value ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-22-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 15 of the imported goods. Imports of consumer goods also have an additional advance VAT rate of 20 percent, and imports of capital goods have an additional 10 percent. Although some of these taxes on importation are reconciled after importation, in practice that takes a significant amount of time. In Argentina’s inflationary environment, this advance payment system disproportionately burdens imports. Since 2022, the Argentine Government has required additional information to request the standard reimbursement of VAT taxes after export, which has introduced additional delays to the process, elevating costs and uncertainty for trade operations. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans Argentina prohibits the importation of many used capital goods. Under the Argentina–Brazil Bilateral Automobile Pact, Argentina bans the importation of used self-propelled agricultural machinery unless it is imported to be rebuilt in-country. Argentina also prohibits the importation and sale of used or retreaded tires (but in some cases allows remolded tires); most used or refurbished medical equipment, including imaging equipment; and used automotive parts. Argentina generally restricts or prohibits the importation of any remanufactured good, such as remanufactured automotive parts, earthmoving equipment, medical equipment, and information and communications technology products. In the case of remanufactured medical goods, imports are further restricted by the requirement that the importer of record must be the end user, such as a hospital, doctor, or clinic. These parties are generally not accustomed to importing and are not typically registered as importers. Import Restrictions Domestic legislation requires compliance with strict conditions on the entry of those used capital goods that are not prohibited from being imported, as follows: (1) used capital goods can only be imported directly by the end user; (2) overseas reconditioning of goods is allowed only if performed by the original manufacturer, and third-party technical appraisals are not permitted; (3) local reconditioning of the good is subject to technical appraisal to be performed only by the state-run Institute of Industrial Technology, except for aircraft-related items; (4) imported used capital goods cannot be transferred (sold or donated) for a period of four years; and (5) except for a short list of products exempted by Decree 406/2019, and regardless of where the reconditioning takes place, the Argentine Customs Authority requires the presentation of a “Certificate of Import of Used Capital Goods” at the time of importation. From 2019 through 2024, most imported goods and services were subject to taxes ranging from 7.5 percent to 30.0 percent, under the Por una Argentina Inclusiva y Solidaria (PAIS) tax regime, making foreign goods and services significantly less competitive in the Argentine market. The Emergency Law establishing this tax expired on December 23, 2024, and the government did not renew it. Since late 2022, pursuant to General Resolution 5272/2022, some purchases also are subject to an advance payment of the personal asset tax equal to 30 percent of the price of the good or service. Resolution 909/1994 places restrictions on the importation of certain used goods for consumption, such as parts and components that are not used in the manufacture of other products. The list imposes import tariffs or other restrictions on goods, including electronic and recording equipment; railroad vehicles and other railroad parts; optic, photography, and filming equipment; tractors; buses; aircraft; and ships. Import Licensing Argentina eliminated the non-automatic import licensing requirements that had been in place since 2020 and established, on December 21, 2023, a new Statistical System of Imports (SEDI), which serves as a ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-23-2048.jpg) ![16 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS platform to record trade data. The United States will continue to monitor Argentina’s import requirements and encourage transparency and predictability in their administration. Foreign Exchange Market Access for Imports Notwithstanding significant improvements to payment terms, importers are still limited in when they can access the foreign exchange market to pay invoices for imported goods and services. Starting August 1, 2024, Argentina’s Central Bank (BCRA) reduced payment terms for imports, from 120 days (in four monthly installments equivalent to 25 percent) to 60 days (in two installments); subsequently, effective October 21, 2024, the BCRA reduced import payment terms to 30 days after the shipment’s registered arrival date in Argentina. The regulation equally applies to all goods of the economy, and all companies, regardless of size, except for specific exceptions in energy, mining, and freight, among other industries, which have immediate access to the foreign exchange market to pay for imports. The remaining restrictions on paying foreign currency invoices require inter-company negotiations or access to credit by the importing party, increasing transaction costs for imported goods and services. Businesses often need to pay an advance and cannot rely on inter-company transfers to make payments from other jurisdictions. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation On October 10, 2024, in General Resolution 5582, Argentina revoked the use of reference prices for goods that originate in, or are imported from, specified countries for customs valuation purposes. Prior to this measure, if a good was imported and the invoice price was lower than the reference price, Argentina required importers to obtain an authenticated invoice. Over the course of 2024, the Ministry of Economy issued numerous resolutions to facilitate international trade by reducing duplicative or burdensome processes and registries in import and customs procedures, and by reducing some quality control requirements in line with international norms. This included eliminating the “economic and financial capacity” analysis and approval for importers, eliminating the automatic “red channel” in customs for goods subject to antidumping, and reducing some safety certifications for products such as bicycles and textiles. Consularization Argentina imposes costly and time-consuming consularization requirements on import documentation, a practice at odds with the current trend in customs practice. Shipments to Argentina require commercial invoices and packing lists to be legalized by the Argentine consulate in the country of export. Consulates will only legalize a commercial document after it has been signed by a Chamber of Commerce that is recognized by the relevant consulate. Furthermore, Argentina requires certificates of origin that must be authenticated by an Argentine Embassy or consulate or carry a U.S. Chamber of Commerce seal. SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Live Cattle Argentina banned imports of U.S. cattle and beef products in 2002 due to purported concerns regarding bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Although the market reopened to U.S. beef in 2018, it remains closed to U.S. live cattle, pending continued technical level engagement between the United States and Argentina on a mutually agreeable sanitary certificate. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-24-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 17 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Argentina remained on the Priority Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. The situation for innovators in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors presents significant challenges. First, the scope of patentable subject matter is significantly restricted under Argentine law. Second, current policies provide inadequate protection against the unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test and other data submitted to the Argentine Government in conjunction with its lengthy marketing approval process. The United States urges Argentina to ensure transparency and due process in the protection of geographical indications (GIs) and to ensure that the grant of GI protection does not deprive interested parties of the ability to use common names, particularly as Argentina proceeds with the European Union– MERCOSUR Trade Agreement. In addition, the backlog continues for patent applications for pharmaceuticals and biosimilar products, resulting in unreasonable delays for these products. Enforcing intellectual property rights in Argentina continues to prove challenging, as counterfeit and pirated goods remain widely available. The physical markets of La Salada and Barrio Once are both listed in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List). For example, La Salada in Buenos Aires, one of the largest black markets for counterfeit and pirated goods in Argentina, continues to sell counterfeit products online. Furthermore, the existing legal regime and weak enforcement hinder the ability of rights holders, law enforcement, and prosecutors to halt, through legal action, the growth of illegal markets, both online and physical. SERVICES BARRIERS Similar to goods importers, services suppliers are subject to restrictions on their ability to access the foreign exchange market. At the same time, pursuant to Decree 70/2023 issued December 21, 2023, Argentina no longer requires import authorization for imports of services and eliminated the electronic system for requesting such authorizations.

The Media Law also establishes broadcast content requirements on companies with radio licenses (particularly for news and music) and on private television operators.

Under this agreement, as of January 1, 2015, Australia provides duty-free access to all U.S. exports. The United States and Australia meet periodically to review the implementation and functioning of the FTA and to address outstanding issues. SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Animal Health Beef Australia requires completion of a complex approval process before it will permit the importation of bovine products from a country that has reported any indigenous cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). In 2003, Australia closed its market to U.S. beef after the detection of BSE in the United States. In May 2018, Australia lifted its ban on heat-treated, shelf-stable beef products from the United States. However, Australia’s market remains closed to fresh U.S. beef and beef products. The United States and Australia held a series of technical discussions to address outstanding differences, and the United States continues to seek full market access for fresh U.S. beef and beef products. Pork Pork and pork products are the third-leading U.S. agricultural export to Australia, valued at approximately $233.5 million in 2023. However, due to Australia’s stated concerns about porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), Australia does not permit imports of fresh/chilled pork and bone-in products from the United States. The United States has provided Australia with scientific evidence demonstrating the safety of U.S. pork products; however, the issue remains unresolved. Access to the Australian market for fresh/chilled/frozen pork, bone-in pork, and pork products remains a high priority for the United States. Poultry Australia prohibits imports of uncooked poultry meat from all countries except New Zealand. While cooked poultry meat products may be imported, current import requirements (as set out in an import risk analysis) mandate that imported poultry meat products be cooked to a minimum core temperature of 74 degrees Celsius for 165 minutes or the equivalent. This cooking temperature is not suitable for prepared deli meats, resulting in a significant barrier for cooked poultry products that would be suitable for sale in restaurants or delicatessens. Since 2012, the United States and Australia have exchanged technical information to attempt to resolve the issue. The United States has identified this issue as a high priority and will continue to work with Australia to gain meaningful commercial market access for cooked poultry meat. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-26-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 19 Plant Health Apples and Pears Australia prohibits the importation of apples and pears from the United States based on concerns regarding several pests. In November 2018, Australia announced it was commencing a new risk analysis for fresh apples from U.S. Pacific Northwest states. In October 2020, Australia published the draft risk analysis for a 90-day comment period. The United States provided comments in response to Australia’s draft risk analysis for U.S. apples in January 2021 and the final risk analysis for U.S. Pacific Northwest apples was published on October 31, 2022. The United States continues to work with Australia to secure market access for U.S. apples. Australia currently prohibits the importation of pears from the United States due to the bacterial disease fire blight. Australia is concerned that the disease could be transmitted to its domestic apple and pear crops. However, the United States has provided evidence to Australia that demonstrates that mature, symptomless pears do not support populations of the fire blight bacteria and are not part of the disease pathway. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Under the FTA, Australia must notify a pharmaceutical product patent owner of a request for marketing approval by a third party for a product claimed by that patent owner. Australia must also provide measures in its marketing approval process to prevent persons other than the patent owner from marketing a patented product during the patent term. U.S. and Australian pharmaceutical companies have expressed concerns about delays in this notification process. The United States has also raised concerns about certain provisions in Australian law regarding potential civil damages in cases where a patent owner seeks a preliminary injunction. The United States will continue to monitor these issues. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Mandatory Bargaining Code On March 2, 2021, the Australian Government passed the Treasury Laws Amendment (News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) Act 2021 (Bargaining Code). Under the Bargaining Code, designated platform services companies are required to engage in negotiations with registered Australian news media businesses to pay the news businesses for content accessed via certain services offered on the companies’ digital platforms. In December 2024, the Government announced its intent to tighten the rules surrounding the Bargaining Code, including by introducing a financial penalty for designated platforms that do not reach or renew commercial agreements. The United States continues to monitor this issue. SERVICES BARRIERS Audiovisual Services Australia is considering imposing Australian screen content requirements on streaming video services as part of its National Cultural Policy. The Policy, published in January 2023, recommends that the Australian Government introduce “requirements for Australian screen content on streaming platforms to ensure continued access to local stories.” The Australian Government has consulted on potential models and intends to introduce legislation codifying the selected model ahead of the federal election, which must be held by May 2025. The United States will continue to monitor this issue to ensure Australia’s compliance with its FTA obligations. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-27-2048.jpg) ![20 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS INVESTMENT BARRIERS In October 2019, a parliamentary legislative committee of the New South Wales (NSW) government recommended that the NSW government address the issue of compensation for certain investors, including U.S. shareholders, in a mining project whose operating license was canceled in 2014.

This Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Bangladesh. IMPORT POLICIES Bangladesh’s import policies are outlined in the Import Policy Order (IPO) 2021-24 issued by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC). The IPO outlines all import-related policies in seven chapters for agricultural and non-agricultural goods. The IPO has two lists: the “List of Controlled Goods” and the “List of Prohibited Goods.” Tariffs Bangladesh’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 14.1 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Bangladesh’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 17.7 percent for agricultural products and 13.5 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Bangladesh has bound 17.6 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 155.1 percent. Non-Tariff Barriers Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Bangladesh ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in September 2016. Bangladesh has not yet submitted its transparency notifications related to import, export, and transit regulations. These notifications were due to the WTO on December 31, 2023, according to Bangladesh’s self-designated TFA implementation schedule. Bangladesh has not notified its customs valuation legislation to the WTO and has not yet responded to the Checklist of Issues describing how the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement is being implemented. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Government procurement is primarily undertaken through public tenders under the Public Procurement Act of 2006 and conducted by the Central Procurement Technical Unit. Bangladesh publicly subscribes to principles of international competitive bidding; however, charges of corruption have been very common. Bangladesh has launched a national electronic government procurement portal, but U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns about the use of outdated technical specifications, the structuring of specifications to favor preferred bidders, and a lack of overall transparency in public tenders. Several U.S. companies have claimed that their foreign competitors often use their local partners to influence the procurement process and to block awards to otherwise competitive U.S. company bids. U.S. companies have reported instances of alleged bid rigging in government tenders in Bangladesh. U.S. companies have also alleged the use of bribery, anticompetitive practices, and a lack of transparency in the bidding process, all of which ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-29-2048.jpg) ![22 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS disadvantage U.S. companies’ bidding on government tenders. Bangladesh’s interim government, which was formed in August 2024 and will remain in office until general elections are held likely in late 2025 or early 2026, has affirmed a commitment to making reforms that would facilitate open tenders and transparent procurement, while suspending negotiations the former regime was pursuing directly. Bangladesh is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Bangladesh continues to lack adequate intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, due in part to the Government devoting limited resources towards IP protection and enforcement, and counterfeit and pirated goods are readily available. A number of U.S. stakeholders have reported increases in potential IP violations across industries, including consumer goods, apparel, pharmaceutical, and software industries. Stakeholders also report a growing trend of Bangladesh serving as a source country for counterfeits distributed globally. The lack of investigative resources and expertise of the police and their reluctance to initiate independent investigations has further impeded IP right holders’ ability to enforce their rights. In addition, IP right holders have raised concerns about the courts’ ability to adjudicate IP cases fairly. Bangladesh has taken some steps in recent years to improve IP protection through legislative reforms, including the passing of a new patent law in April 2022, which was further revised in September 2023, followed by copyright amendments in October 2023, and the enactment of the Industrial Design Act in July 2023. However, the effectiveness of these changes remains uncertain since the implementing rules have yet to be finalized. Additionally, the lack of stakeholder interaction and a public comment process in the development of these reforms remains a concern. Bangladesh continues to lack transparent rulemaking processes that include seeking input from stakeholders in order to address the gaps in IP protection and make meaningful improvements to its IP regime. To strengthen Bangladesh’s IP regime, better coordination among enforcement authorities and other government institutions is crucial. These include Customs, the Office of the Attorney General, the Copyright Office, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), and the Department of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks (DPDT). In addition, customs officials, police, and the judiciary would benefit from participating in available training opportunities as a means of improving Bangladesh’s IP rights enforcement. Recognizing the challenges faced by Bangladesh, the United States continues to engage through the TICFA and has provided IP-related technical assistance and capacity building focused on issues such as copyright, trademarks, geographical indications (GI) and enforcement. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Internet Services The Information and Communication Technology Act of 2006, amended in 2013, authorizes the Government of Bangladesh to access any computer system for the purpose of obtaining any information or data, and to intercept information transmitted through any computer resource. Under this law, Bangladesh may also prohibit the transmission of any data or voice call and censor online communications. In February 2022, the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC) published the Regulation for Digital, Social Media and Over the Top (OTT) Platforms, 2021. The regulations were ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-30-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 23 presented in their final form to a subdivision of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on October 19, 2022. The regulations are a content governance framework for digital, social media, and media platforms operating in the country. The framework seeks to introduce traceability within end-to-end encrypted services. Industry and civil society stakeholders have expressed concerns that the regulations will grant government authorities sweeping powers to dictate online content with the threat of criminal liability for firms and employees deemed noncompliant. Personal Data Protection Regulation The Information and Communication Technology Division (ICT Division) of the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology has developed the Personal Data Protection Act (formerly the Data Protection Act), which received in-principle approval from the cabinet in November 2023. On January 21, 2025, the Ministry published a new draft bill, which was subsequently retracted. If adopted, the latest version of the law would apply to the collection, processing, use, and sharing of data of individuals within Bangladesh, as well as data outside Bangladesh that is related to citizens of, or business carried out in, Bangladesh. Concerns remain over data localization requirements on “classified data,” which could also allow access to data by Bangladeshi law enforcement. The most recent draft was advanced with minimal stakeholder consultation, raising concerns around transparency in rulemaking. Cybersecurity In September 2023, the Bangladesh Parliament passed the Cyber Security Act of 2023 (CSA), replacing the Digital Security Act of 2018. The law, like its predecessor, criminalizes certain forms of free expression by allowing for court cases to be brought against people for online posts. On December 3, 2024, the interim government approved a draft Cyber Protection Ordinance to replace the CSA. The ordinance will have the full force of law if ratified by the next Parliament. Shutdowns and Other Threats to the Open Internet Since 2015, Bangladesh has regularly imposed Internet shutdowns that restrict access to information and services, disrupting commercial operations, and thereby undermining a free and open Internet and impeding trade in the digital economy. The BTRC ordered mobile operators to limit data transmissions for political reasons on several occasions in 2019, 2020, and 2023 ahead of politically sensitive events, including local and national-level elections. The BTRC ordered mobile operators to block all services in the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, except for voice calls, from September 2019 until August 2020. During the July 2024 to August 2024 civil unrest that led to the change in government, the BTRC shut off all internet and mobile data in the country for a period of 10 days. A subsequent investigation by the interim government found this shutdown had occurred without judicial or administrative approval. The United States continues to monitor the impact of these events on U.S. trade and investment, including services exports. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Bangladesh generally permits 100 percent foreign ownership in most sectors, but foreign ownership is subject to equity caps in certain sectors, including petroleum marketing, gas distribution, and telecommunications. Foreign investors must also receive a No Objection Certificate from the relevant government ministry in order to invest in 22 sectors, including banking, finance, and insurance; power generation and distribution; large-scale infrastructure projects; chemicals; and oil and natural gas. Bangladesh permits the repatriation of profits, revenue, dividends, and external payments, but U.S. and other foreign investors have raised concerns that the procedures and requirements for outbound transfers of ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-31-2048.jpg) ![24 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS investment-related capital from Bangladesh remain cumbersome, lack transparency, and often result in significant delays, with some companies waiting over a year for approvals of their repatriation applications. U.S. companies seeking remittances have also reported significant delays in securing required approvals from regulators, which are required before companies can seek central bank clearance. Bangladesh’s interim government has agreed to enter into formal repayment agreements with U.S. companies with outstanding arrears and has committed to improving bureaucratic procedures for approving the repatriation of investment-related capital, which the United States will continue to monitor. SUBSIDIES Bangladesh maintains a range of agricultural subsidies but made small reductions in subsidies for the 2024- 2025 budget year. The subsidies allow grain to be purchased at a support price, and reduce the price of production inputs for producers, including for non-product-specific support through subsidized fertilizers, diesel fuel, electricity for irrigation, and agricultural machinery. Support for diesel fuel and agricultural machinery has yet to be notified to the WTO Committee on Agriculture. The subsidized fertilizer is distributed through a controlled channel, which keeps prices reasonably stable. In addition, Bangladesh provides export cash incentives for a variety of agricultural products, including vegetables, fruits, and processed agricultural products. In 2023, Bangladesh notified a backlog of domestic support notifications through Fiscal Year 2020/2021 to the WTO Committee on Agriculture. The most recent export subsidy notifications cover Fiscal Year 2006/2007. Bangladesh has never submitted a subsidies notification to the WTO Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. According to publicly available information from the Bangladesh Investment and Development Authority, industries exporting more than 80 percent of their goods, regardless of their locations (i.e., within or outside of an export processing zone), can be exempted from income tax for 50 percent of their export earnings, provided that the industry is not already paying income tax at a reduced rate. Furthermore, exporters in certain sectors may be eligible for additional benefits in the form of a subsidy or cash incentive based on certain conditions. Other publicly available information indicates that exporters in 43 sectors receive cash incentives, ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of the export value, as long as the exported product contains at least 30 percent domestic value added. Bangladesh is currently excepted from the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures prohibition on export subsidies by virtue of its status as a least developed country (LDC). Bangladesh continues to support proposals that would allow a WTO Member to continue to benefit from this exception even after it graduates from LDC status. LABOR In 2013, the United States suspended all of Bangladesh’s tariff benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program due to Bangladesh’s failure to meet statutory eligibility requirements related to worker rights, particularly with regard to acceptable conditions of work in the ready-made garment sector, including fire and building safety, and freedom of association. As of December 31, 2024, Bangladesh remained ineligible for duty-free treatment under GSP. During 2024, the United States Government developed an 11-point Labor Action Plan for Bangladesh, detailing actions the Government of Bangladesh would need take to demonstrate that it is taking steps to meet the worker rights eligibility criteria for the GSP program. The Labor Action Plan focuses on improving the ability of workers to form and join independent trade unions, enhancing accountability for violence against workers, and enforcing health and safety regulations through improved labor inspection. The United States Government delivered the Labor Action Plan to the Government of Bangladesh during the April 2024 TICFA intersessional meeting in Dhaka.

OTHER BARRIERS Bribery and Corruption Corruption is a pervasive and long-standing problem in Bangladesh, and anticorruption law is inadequately enforced. The Code of Criminal Procedure, the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Penal Code, and the Money Laundering Prevention Act criminalize attempted corruption, extortion, active and passive bribery, bribery of foreign public officials, money laundering, and use of public resources or non-public state information for private gain. However, bribery and extortion in commercial dealings have been common features of business despite the illegality of facilitation payments and gifts. There have also been efforts to water down anti-corruption safeguards of government procurement rules. U.S. companies have complained about long delays in obtaining approval of licenses and bids as Bangladeshi Government officials seek bribes. The interim government has highlighted fighting corruption as one of its top reform priorities. There have been continuous proposals to curb the independence of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), the main institutional anticorruption watchdog. The Sarkari Chakori Ain Bill (Government Job Act), enacted in October 2018, requires the ACC to seek permission of the authorities concerned before arresting any government official and limits the ability of the ACC in investigating corruption allegations against government officials. While the ACC has increasingly pursued cases against government officials, mainly lower-level officials and some higher-level officials, there remains a large backlog of cases. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-33-2048.jpg) ![26 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS BOLIVIA IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Bolivia’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 11.8 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Bolivia’s average MFN applied tariff rate for agricultural products was 13.2 percent and 11.5 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Bolivia has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 40 percent. Bolivia’s MFN tariff structure consists of seven rates ranging from zero percent to 40 percent. The tariff rates are: zero percent for certain capital goods, such as machinery and equipment that are not produced locally or are considered essential for the development of strategic sectors, such as agriculture, mining, and infrastructure; 5 percent for other capital goods and inputs, generally applied to raw materials and some intermediate products required for production of final goods in country; 10 percent for most intermediate products, including production inputs, food items, and equipment; 15 percent for final consumer goods and finished products that compete with local production and a wide-range of other products imported for direct consumption, such as fruit, vegetables, and fish; and 20 percent to 40 percent for certain products related to sectors the Bolivian government protects due to local production, such as luxury goods, vehicles, certain types of textiles, and clothing. Bolivian law allows the government to raise tariffs if necessary to protect domestic industry or, alternatively, to lower tariffs if supplies run short. In July 2024, Bolivia was approved for full membership in the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), formed in 1991, which also includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. As a result, the Bolivian Government will be required to adjust its tariff structure over the next four years. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans In 2023, Bolivia imposed import prohibitions on 33 tariff lines. Prohibited items include some types of vehicles and motor vehicles, in particular, vehicles using liquefied gas, used motor vehicles more than one year old, motor vehicles more than three years old used for the transport of more than 10 persons, and special-purpose motor vehicles more than five years old. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Bolivia ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in January 2018. In September 2024, Bolivia submitted its transparency notifications related to: (1) import, export, and transit regulations; (2) the operation of the single window; (3) the use of customs brokers; and (4) customs contact points for the exchange of information.

This resolution includes technical regulations on labeling of cosmetic and personal care products and prohibits existing labels to comply with specific Andean Community labeling requirements. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Import Permits The National Agricultural Health and Food Safety Service (SENASAG) is responsible for certifying the health safety status of products for domestic consumption, including imports, and for issuing sanitary and phytosanitary import permits. Importers have voiced concerns regarding SENASAG’s transparency and with the inconsistent application of agricultural health and food safety standards and regulations. SENASAG inspectors routinely use inconsistent and unclear criteria when evaluating food health and safety standards and reviewing supporting importation documents. A lack of transparency in the institution increases the uncertainty about whether products entering Bolivia will be examined using clear and consistent criteria. Bolivia’s facility registration requirements for animal products (beef, pork, poultry, dairy, genetic material, and animal by-products) are more onerous than necessary to protect health, and SENASAG applies these requirements in an inconsistent manner. These practices have limited the ability for several U.S. agricultural exporters to gain market access to Bolivia, despite the demand for these products. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT The Buy Bolivian (Compro Boliviano) program supports domestic production by giving preference margins to domestic goods or suppliers in government procurement. Importers of foreign products can participate in procurements valued between $142,000 and $5.7 million only in cases where domestically-manufactured products and domestic service providers are unavailable or when the Bolivian Government does not initially select a domestic supplier. Foreign companies submitting tenders for government consultancy contracts are required to do so in association with a Bolivian company, although the Bolivian Government occasionally makes exceptions in strategic sectors. For national and international tenders, preference margins are from 10 percent to 25 percent for Bolivian inputs. As a general matter, the tendering process is nontransparent and acts as a barrier to participation. Government requirements and the details of the tender are not always defined, and procurement notices are not always made public. For example, many of the state-owned companies, including the state-owned oil and gas company, Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos, the state-owned electricity company, Empresa Nacional de Electricidad, and, the state lithium company, Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos, are not required to publish tenders through the official procurement website, Sistema de Contrataciones Estatales. U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns that these state-owned companies are not required to follow the procedures established in the national procurement law. One U.S. company noted a Bolivian Government tender was prepared in such a way that only one specific company would be able to qualify. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-35-2048.jpg) ![28 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Bolivia is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Bolivia remained on the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. The report noted that significant challenges continue with respect to adequate and effective intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement. While certain Bolivian laws provide for the protection of copyrights, patents, and trademarks, they do not address trade secret protection. Significant challenges also persist with respect to widespread piracy and counterfeiting. The Special 301 Report again encouraged Bolivia to improve its weak protection and enforcement of IP. Bolivia’s IP agency, Servicio Nacional de Propiedad Intelectual, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 2020 to help address Bolivia’s challenges. However, the Bolivian administration that took office at the end of 2020 does not recognize the MOU. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES In an effort to control key sectors of the economy, the Bolivian Government has made state-owned enterprises (SOEs) a major feature of the Bolivian economy. The government has obtained or maintained majority ownership in a number of companies in a long list of sectors including hydrocarbons, electricity, mining, and telecommunications. Bolivia has also created dozens of new public companies in “strategic” sectors such as food production, industrialization of natural resources, air travel, banking, and mining. U.S. stakeholders have expressed concern that these SOEs engage in unfair subsidized competition, constituting a significant barrier to investment. The Bolivian Government owns the second-largest bank in Bolivia, Banco Union, which competes with U.S. providers of banking services. Other SOEs include: the Sugar Cane Company of San Buena Aventura; Bolivia’s Industrialization Company of Gas and Oil; computer technology company QUIPUS; dairy processing company Lácteosbol; recycled paper company PAPELBOL; Brazil nut export company Empresa Boliviana de Alimentos; Bolivian national airline Boliviana de Aviación, the main operator in Bolivia; oil and gas company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos; electricity company Empresa Nacional de Electricidad; and lithium company Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos. Large SOEs such as these can acquire credit from the Central Bank at very low interest rates and on more convenient terms than non- SOEs, resulting in an unfair financial subsidy. The largest five SOEs alone owe the Central Bank $5.3 billion, more than double Bolivia’s international reserves. In many cases, government entities are directed by the government to do business with SOEs. The Bolivian Government grants ownership rights and controls the exploitation, exploration, and industrialization of natural resources through joint ventures between government entities or state-owned companies and public companies, communities, and private companies. No concessions or contracts may transfer ownership of hydrocarbon deposits to private or other interests. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-36-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 29 BRAZIL TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Brazil Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation The United States and Brazil signed the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation (ATEC) on March 19, 2011.

On November 17, 2021, the Brazilian Congress ratified the 2020 United States–Brazil Protocol Regarding Trade Rules and Transparency, which entered into force on February 2, 2022. The Protocol updated the ATEC in the areas of anticorruption, good regulatory practices, and trade facilitation and customs administration. Implementation of the Protocol fosters a more transparent economic environment, reduces red tape, and improves regulatory processes. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs Brazil’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 11.2 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Brazil’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 8.1 percent for agricultural products and 11.7 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Brazil has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 31.4 percent. Brazil’s maximum bound tariff rate for non-agricultural products is 35 percent, and its maximum bound tariff rate for most agricultural products is 55 percent. Brazil is a founding member of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), formed in 1991, which also includes Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. On July 5, 2024, Bolivia promulgated its law to become a full member, and it is in the process of incorporating MERCOSUR’s regulations. The MERCOSUR Common External Tariff (CET) ranges from zero percent to 35.0 percent ad valorem. In July 2022, MERCOSUR countries agreed to a 10 percent reduction of the CET for over 80 percent of tariff lines. The decision reduced the block’s average CET to 10.3 percent and its weighted average to 9.5 percent. Any good imported into Brazil (not including from free trade zones) is subject to payment of the CET to Brazil’s customs authority. If the product is then re-exported to another MERCOSUR country, the CET must be paid again to the second country. MERCOSUR approved a Common Customs Code (CCC) in 2010 and launched a plan to eliminate the double application of the CET within MERCOSUR in 2021. However, only Argentina has ratified the CCC, therefore it has not yet taken effect. Although the Brazilian Congress approved the agreement in 2018, it has not been promulgated by the executive branch, which is necessary for ratification. Brazil imposes relatively high tariffs on imports across a wide range of sectors, including automobiles, automotive parts, information technology and electronics, chemicals, plastics, industrial machinery, steel, and textiles and apparel. In addition, Brazil’s bound rates are often much higher than its applied rates, and U.S. exporters face significant uncertainty in the Brazilian market because the government frequently modifies tariff rates within the flexibilities of MERCOSUR. The lack of predictability with regard to tariff rates makes it difficult for U.S. exporters to forecast the costs of doing business in Brazil. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-37-2048.jpg) ![30 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Ethanol Tariff Between 2011 and 2017, bilateral trade of ethanol between the United States and Brazil, the world’s two largest producers and consumers of ethanol, was virtually duty free. However, between September 2017 and January 2022, Brazil imposed first a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) and then the MERCOSUR CET of 20 percent on all imports of ethanol, the vast majority of which the United States supplies. Although the tariff was below Brazil’s WTO bound tariff rate of 35 percent, the TRQ and the CET have reduced previously robust bilateral trade of ethanol. Brazil temporarily suspended the tariff, effective March 23, 2022, but that suspension expired on January 31, 2023, when the tariff was reimposed at 16 percent. The tariff then increased to 18 percent in 2024. The United States continues to engage with Brazil to lower its ethanol tariff to provide reciprocal treatment for trade in ethanol between the United States and Brazil. Taxes Brazil imposes a 16.25 percent ad valorem Industrial Product Tax (IPI) on cachaça, a domestic distinctive product produced from sugarcane, while imposing a 19.5 percent ad valorem IPI on other alcoholic beverages, including imports from the United States. In audiovisual services, Brazil imposes several taxes on foreign products that it does not apply equally to domestic products. Brazil imposes a fixed tax on each foreign film released in theaters, foreign home entertainment products, foreign programming for broadcast television, and foreign content and foreign advertising released on cable and satellite channels. The taxes are significantly higher than the corresponding taxes levied on Brazilian products. In addition, 80 percent of the programming aired on “open broadcast” (non-cable) television channels must be Brazilian and foreign ownership in print media and “open broadcast” television is limited to 30 percent. Remittances to foreign producers of audiovisual works are subject to a 25 percent income withholding tax. As an alternative to paying the full tax, producers can elect to invest 70 percent of the tax value in local independent productions. In addition, local distributors of foreign films are subject to a tax equal to 11 percent of remittances to the foreign producer or, alternatively, the distributor may invest an amount equal to 3 percent of the total remittances in local independent productions. This levy is also assessed on foreign- produced video and audio advertising. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans Brazil restricts the entry of certain types of remanufactured goods (e.g., earthmoving equipment, automotive parts, and medical equipment). Brazil only allows the importation of such goods if an importer can provide evidence that the goods are not or cannot be produced domestically, or if they meet certain other limited exceptions. With some exceptions, Brazil generally prohibits imports of used consumer goods, including automobiles, clothing, tires, medical equipment, and information and communications technology products. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-38-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 31 Import Licensing Brazil has both automatic and non-automatic import licensing requirements. Brazil’s non-automatic import licensing system covers imports of products that require authorization from specific ministries or agencies, such as agricultural commodities and beverages (Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply (MAPA)) and pharmaceuticals (National Sanitary Regulatory Agency). A list of products subject to non-automatic import licensing procedures is available on the Secretariat of Foreign Trade’s computerized documentation system, but specific information related to non-automatic import licensing requirements and explanations for rejections of non-automatic import license applications are not available. The lack of transparency surrounding these procedures is an impediment to U.S. exports. U.S. exporters of footwear and apparel and in the automotive sector have expressed concerns about these non-automatic licensing requirements. For automobiles, delays in issuing non-automatic import licenses negatively affect exports of U.S. automobile and automotive parts to Brazil. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation U.S. companies continue to complain of inconsistent documentation requirements for the importation of certain types of goods, such as heavy equipment. These documentation requirements apply even if imports are on a temporary basis and are destined for use in other countries. In January 2022, Brazil changed the documentation requirements for temporary admission of goods, making it difficult to bring samples, equipment, or displays for exhibitions into Brazil without paying significant customs duties. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Biofuels Regulations Brazil’s national biofuels policy, “RenovaBio,” promotes the development and use of biofuels through the creation of a carbon credit market to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Under the program’s current rules, non-Brazilian producers of biofuels are ineligible to participate in and qualify for carbon credits under the program. The United States continues to engage with Brazil, including through formal U.S. comments on Brazil’s recent draft revisions to RenovaBio, to urge Brazil to revise its regulations to allow U.S. producers to be eligible for equal treatment under the program. Wine Regulations Brazil requires duplicative documentation for imports of wine. Technical Regulation No. 75 of December 31, 2019, requires that imported wine have both a certificate of analysis and an import inspection pre- certification report generated by a Brazilian laboratory upon importation. The United States continues to monitor Brazil’s pending updates to its wine regulations, specifically regarding export certification and laboratory testing requirements for wine products. Telecommunications Products Effective December 2021, Brazil’s telecommunications agency (ANATEL) established approval requirements as a prerequisite for importing telecommunications products for usage and sale, with exceptions for products entering the country for demonstration, self-use, scientific purposes, or manufacturing of exports. Approval must be obtained prior to the product’s entry into the country. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-39-2048.jpg) ![32 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Pork In a Joint Statement issued by the White House on March 19, 2019, the United States and Brazil agreed to science-based conditions to open Brazil’s market to U.S. pork. However, Brazil’s market is still closed to U.S. fresh and frozen pork due to Brazil’s concerns that pork products imported into the United States from the European Union increase risks associated with African Swine Fever. Brazil has not provided scientific evidence that supports the ban and the ban appears to be inconsistent with World Organization for Animal Health international standards. Discussions between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and MAPA are ongoing but have yet to establish access for U.S. pork exports to Brazil. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Although Brazil has taken steps to make its procurement market more transparent, restrictions and domestic preferences remain. For example, Brazilian state enterprises may only subcontract services to a foreign firm if domestic expertise is unavailable and foreign firms may only bid to provide technical services if there are no qualified Brazilian firms. Brazil also requires procurement contracts, particularly in the health and defense sectors, to contain offset requirements for foreign suppliers, which include domestic manufacturing or co-production requirements and technology transfer. Although Brazil has required offsets for defense trade since the 1970s, in 2023, the Ministry of Defense published the new Defense Technological, Industrial and Commercial Offset Policy - PComTIC Defesa (Ordinance GM-MD No. 3,990, of August 3, 2023), which imposes further obligations to establish cooperation agreements for all imports of defense products worth more than $50 million. Law 12,598/2012 for Strategic Defense Companies further provides preferential treatment mechanisms for domestic goods and suppliers in defense procurement. Brazil is not a Party to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since October 2017. Although Brazil applied for accession to the GPA in May 2020, the Brazilian Government withdrew its offer to accede to the agreement on May 30, 2023, noting that it did not want to impose limits on the government’s purchasing power. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Brazil remained on the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. Despite improvements in recent years, as outlined in that report, enforcement challenges continue, including the absence of deterrent-level penalties and high levels of counterfeiting and piracy online and in physical markets. The Rua 25 de Março area in São Paulo is listed in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List) for selling counterfeit and pirated goods. Deterrent-level penalties and increased emphasis on enforcement at the tri-border region between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay are critical to make sustained progress on these intellectual property concerns. Patent application pendency of almost seven years (and nine years for pharmaceutical products) has impacted the effective patent term. Also, pharmaceutical stakeholders remain concerned that Brazilian law and regulations do not provide for protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test results and other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products for human use, although such protection is provided for veterinary and agricultural chemical products. The United States urges Brazil to ensure transparency and due process in the protection of geographical indications (GIs) and to ensure that the grant of GI protection ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-40-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 33 does not deprive interested parties of the ability to use common names, particularly as Brazil proceeds with the European Union–Mercosur Trade Agreement.

In addition, the law delegates significant programming and advertising regulatory authority to the national film industry development agency, which raises concerns about the impartiality of regulatory decisions. Brazil also maintains domestic film quotas for theatrical screening and home video distribution. Express Delivery The Brazilian Government charges a flat 60 percent duty for all express shipments imported through the Simplified Customs Clearance process. The Simplified Customs Clearance process limits commercial shipments to $100,000 per importer per year. Moreover, Brazilian Customs has established express delivery maximum per-shipment value limits of $10,000 for exports and $3,000 for imports. Financial Services Brazil maintains reciprocity requirements for foreign banks and insurers to establish operations in Brazil. Foreign banks may establish subsidiaries, but Brazilian residents must be directly responsible for the administration of the financial institution. Since 1995, entry into the banking sector through the establishment of branches has not been permitted. Telecommunications Services Satellites Brazil permits Brazilian-owned entities to acquire the exclusive right to operate a satellite and its associated frequencies from specific positions. However, foreign-licensed satellite operators may obtain only a nonexclusive right (a landing right) to provide service in Brazilian territory. ANATEL grants these landing rights for a fixed term of no longer than 15 years, after which the operator must reacquire the landing rights to continue providing services. Foreign operators are also required to pay higher annual landing fees than Brazilian firms. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Network Usage Fees In 2023, ANATEL, opened a public consultation on proposed regulation of “value added services” and digital platforms. The consultation sought input on possible regulations on large content providers that offer services over broadband networks, including remuneration obligations and a “connectivity fund” funded by digital platforms in Brazil. U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns that the direct payments under the proposal could reinforce the dominance of the largest operators, and that fees could raise costs for end- users. ANATEL issued notification of a second consultation that concluded in May 2024. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-41-2048.jpg) ![34 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Personal Data Protection Regulation Brazil’s General Law for the Protection of Personal Data (LGPD) includes provisions concerning restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of Brazil.

Brunei’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 0.1 percent for agricultural products and 0.6 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Brunei has bound 95.5 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 25.4 percent. Brunei’s highest WTO bound tariff rate for non-tobacco products is 50 percent. Taxes In May 2023, Brunei expanded its 2017 beverage tax policy to include sweetened or flavored drinks with low sugar content, while excluding some beverages that contain added sugar. Some industry stakeholders advocate for a tiered tax structure that taxes all sugar-sweetened beverage categories equally on a tiered volumetric basis with respect to sugar content to incentivize reformulation to lower-sugar beverages. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE Halal Import Requirements Brunei’s Halal Certificate and Halal Label Order Amendment, enacted in May 2017, requires all businesses that produce, import, distribute, or serve food and beverages to obtain a halal certificate from the Islamic Religious Council of Brunei (MUIB) and to renew this certificate annually. Under Brunei’s Halal Meat Act, halal meat can be imported only by a person holding a halal import permit issued by the MUIB and an export permit issued by the exporting country. Prior to export, Bruneian Government inspectors must travel to slaughter facilities in the home country of the exporter to inspect the slaughter and processing operations. The Bruneian Government maintains a list of the foreign and local slaughtering centers (abattoirs) that have been inspected and declared fit for supplying meat that can be certified as halal. None of the 40 foreign slaughterhouses currently approved by the MUIB are located in the United States. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-43-2048.jpg) ![36 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS OTHER BARRIERS Residency Requirement Under the Companies Act, 100 percent foreign-owned companies cannot locally incorporate in Brunei unless at least one of two directors of that locally incorporated company is a resident of Brunei. If a 100 percent foreign-owned company has more than two directors, then at least two must be residents of Brunei. The government may grant an exemption from this requirement, although it has granted none to date. Transparency In Brunei, the decision-making process regarding economic policies and regulations is centralized, including with respect to critical sectors like oil and gas, telecommunications, transportation, and energy generation and distribution. Brunei’s centralized decision-making lacks public consultation mechanisms. Further, significant portions of these industries are owned by or under substantial control of the government. As a result, there is a lack of transparency with respect to such state-owned enterprises. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-44-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 37 CAMBODIA TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Cambodia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement The United States and Cambodia signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement on July 14, 2006. This Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Cambodia. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Cambodia’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 9.4 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Cambodia’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 11.9 percent for agricultural products and 9.0 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Cambodia has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 19.3 percent. Cambodia’s highest applied tariff rate is 35 percent, which is imposed on several product categories, including a wide variety of prepared food products, bottled and canned beverages, table salt, paints and varnishes, cosmetic and skin care products, glass and glassware, electrical appliances, cars, furniture, and video games. On June 6, 2023, Cambodia issued Sub-Decree 122 on the Adjustment of Customs Tariffs and Special Tax Rates on Certain Goods, applicable to sectors such as agriculture, transportation, healthcare, industry, and mining. The Sub-Decree went into effect July 1, 2023. Businesses and importers may check the new tariff rates on the Cambodian General Department of Customs and Excise website by using the relevant Harmonized System (HS) code. The lack of detailed guidance about HS classification of products by customs officials remains a concern for U.S. stakeholders. Some importers claimed that, due to a lack of clear guidance, if a product could fall under multiple HS codes, Cambodian customs and excise officials will typically classify the product as falling within the HS code with a higher tariff rate. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Government procurement is often not transparent, and the Cambodian Government frequently provides short response times to public announcements of tenders, which are posted on the Ministry of Economy and Finance’s website. For construction projects, only bidders registered with the Ministry are permitted to participate in tenders. Irregularities in the government procurement process are common, despite a strict legal requirement for audits and inspections. Despite allegations of malfeasance at several ministries, the Cambodian Government has taken little action to investigate irregularities. In May 2023, the new Law on Public Procurement was promulgated to replace the 2012 law, introducing additional provisions to further regulate the management and implementation of all public procurements. U.S. stakeholders have not reported any noticeable changes to government procurement processes. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-45-2048.jpg) ![38 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Cambodia is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Despite efforts to raise intellectual property (IP) awareness, the sale of counterfeit and pirated goods remains commonplace in Cambodian markets, especially those frequented by tourists. The Central Market in Phnom Penh is included in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List). The rates of signal and cable piracy also remain high, and online sites purveying pirated music, films, electronic books, software, and television shows remain popular. In addition, legitimate film sales have been negatively affected as a result of the popularity of illegal cinemas that show pirated material. Various Cambodian authorities that work on IP-related issues include the Interior Ministry’s Anti- Economic Crime Police unit, the General Department of Customs and Excise of Cambodia (GDCE), the Consumer Protection Competition and Fraud Repression Directorate-General, the National Committee for Intellectual Property Rights, the Institute of Standards of Cambodia, the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, and the Ministry of Commerce. Some of these institutions have overlapping responsibilities with respect to IP-related issues. The Interior Ministry’s Cambodia Counter Counterfeit Committee, which previously cracked down on counterfeit products, transferred that responsibility to the Anti-Economic Crime Police and now focuses on raising awareness only. Draft legislation to address the protection of trade secrets is under review by the Ministry of Commerce but has not been passed. On September16 2024, the GDCE, which is part of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, introduced its online Intellectual Property Recordation System for right holders to record trademarks, copyrights, related rights, and geographical indications, as well as details about potential counterfeit goods. The system also supports the recordation of exclusive distributorships registered with the Ministry of Commerce. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Cambodia passed an electronic commerce law in November 2019, which was fully implemented in May 2020. The law governs the conduct of electronic commerce within Cambodia and from overseas. Cambodia’s National Assembly passed a sub-decree in February 2021 to establish a National Internet Gateway that would require all Internet traffic to be routed through a single node regulated by a government-appointed operator. Cambodia’s implementation of the National Internet Gateway has been paused, but not officially cancelled. Both the private sector and human rights organizations have expressed concerns over the effect the National Internet Gateway could have on freedom and online commerce in Cambodia. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Cambodia’s constitution restricts the foreign ownership of land. A 2010 law allows the foreign ownership of property above the ground floor of a structure but stipulates that no more than 70 percent of a building may be foreign-owned and that foreigners may not own property within 30 kilometers of the national border. Foreign investors may only own land if the title is held by at least one Cambodian citizen or an entity with at least 51 percent Cambodian ownership. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-46-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 39 Foreign investment in movie production, rice milling, and gemstone mining and processing is subject to local equity participation requirements. While Cambodia has made significant progress in formalizing its tax regime and increasing tax revenues, some stakeholders question the General Department of Taxation’s tax collection methods, including assessing some organizations with unexplained tax bills and freezing assets for failure to pay purported back taxes. Additional concerns range from surprise tax audits to a lack of stakeholder consultation when implementing new tax codes. OTHER BARRIERS Transparency Despite the Cambodian Government’s calls for public consultation on new draft regulations in recent years, some businesses have raised concerns with the lack of opportunity for meaningful stakeholder engagement. Some stakeholders have also expressed concerns regarding the short notice and lack of detailed public comment procedures for proposed laws and regulations. Foods and health-related products are commonly regulated by multi-ministerial regulations called Joint- Prakas and are subject to review and approval by all ministries listed in the Joint-Prakas for aspects ranging from a product’s registration to its sale. U.S. businesses have voiced concerns about a lack of clarity on each ministry’s authority under the Joint-Prakas. Bribery and Corruption Both foreign and local businesses have identified corruption in Cambodia as a major obstacle and a deterrent to investment. Cambodia’s judiciary is viewed as one of the country’s most corrupt institutions. In 2010, Cambodia adopted anticorruption legislation and established a national Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) to undertake investigations, implement law enforcement measures, and conduct public outreach. Enforcement, however, remains inconsistent. U.S. businesses have noted that signing an anticorruption memorandum of understanding with the ACU has helped them to avoid paying “facilitation payments.” However, businesses have noted that they still encounter red tape in obtaining licenses and permits. Cambodia published official fees for all public services in 2012 in an effort to combat “facilitation payments;” however, that publication has not been updated, making it difficult to determine current public service fees. Some ministries publish service fees on their official websites, and others do not. On June 22, 2023, Cambodia rolled out the third phase of an online business registration platform, aimed to eliminate the need for cash payments and to reduce overall fees for public services. Despite covering over 20 ministries and state-run institutions, the platform still does not cover all ministries and relevant agencies. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-47-2048.jpg) ![40 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS CANADA TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) entered into force on July 1, 2020. The USMCA maintains the zero tariffs that were in place among the three countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement and modernized the agreement to include strong, enforceable labor and environmental obligations, ground-breaking provisions to combat non-market practices, and provisions covering small and medium-sized enterprises. IMPORT POLICIES Non-Tariff Barriers Agricultural Supply Management Canada uses supply-management systems to regulate its dairy, chicken, turkey, and egg industries. Canada’s supply-management system involves production quotas, producer-marketing boards to regulate price and supply, and tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for imports. Canada’s supply-management system severely limits the ability of U.S. producers to increase exports to Canada above TRQ levels and increases the prices that Canadians pay for dairy and poultry products. Under the current system, U.S. imports above quota levels are subject to prohibitively high tariffs (e.g., 245 percent for cheese and 298 percent for butter). The USMCA expands market access opportunities for dairy products through new TRQs exclusively for U.S. products. Canada has also opened new TRQs for U.S. chicken and U.S. eggs and egg products. In addition, Canada expanded market access for U.S. turkey. Canada and the United States also agreed to strong rules to ensure TRQs are administered fairly and transparently to help ensure exporters benefit from the full market access negotiated in the USMCA. In May 2021, the United States requested and established a dispute settlement panel under the USMCA to review Canada’s dairy TRQ allocation measures that undermined the value of the TRQs by setting aside and reserving access to in-quota quantities exclusively for processors. The final panel report was released to the public in January 2022. The panel agreed with the United States that Canada’s allocation of dairy TRQs—specifically the set-aside of a percentage of each dairy TRQ exclusively for Canadian processors— is inconsistent with Canada’s commitment in Article 3.A.2.11(b) of the USMCA not to “limit access to an allocation to processors.” Canada made changes to its dairy TRQ allocation measures following the release of the panel report, but the United States rejected those changes as a basis to resolve the dispute. In May 2022, the United States— for the second time—requested dispute settlement consultations with Canada under the USMCA to address Canadian allocation measures that impose new conditions on the allocation and use of the TRQs and prohibit eligible applicants, including retailers, food service operators, and other types of importers, from accessing TRQ allocations. In December 2022, the United States requested new dispute settlement consultations, expanding its challenge of Canada’s dairy TRQ allocation measures to include Canada’s use of a market-share approach for determining TRQ allocations, which applies different criteria for different segments of applicants, and Canada’s failure to allow importers the opportunity to fully utilize TRQ quantities. On January 31, 2023, the United States requested and established a second dispute settlement ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-48-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 41 panel under the USMCA to address Canada’s continued failure to abide by its USMCA commitments with its dairy TRQ allocation measures. The final panel report was released to the public on November 24, 2023. The panel found that Canada’s measures are not inconsistent with the USMCA provisions cited by the United States. The panel split on the U.S. claims that Canada’s exclusion from eligibility of retailers, food service operators, and other entities, and Canada’s historical market share approach to allocate its USMCA dairy TRQs breach Canada’s USMCA obligations. A dissenting panelist agreed with the United States that by excluding retailers and others, Canada was breaching its commitment to make its dairy TRQs available to all applicants active in the Canadian food or agriculture sector. The United States remains committed to securing the full benefit of the market access that Canada committed to under the USMCA and full compliance with Canada’s USMCA obligations. The United States also remains concerned about potential Canadian actions that would further limit U.S. exports to the Canadian dairy market and continues to monitor closely any tariff reclassifications of dairy products to ensure that U.S. market access is not negatively affected. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation On October 21, 2024, the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officially launched the CBSA Assessment and Revenue Management (CARM) system to assess and collect duties and taxes for commercial goods imported into Canada. The new system requires importers of record to register in the CARM Client Portal and post a financial security with the CBSA. Previously, these steps could be taken by a customs broker on behalf of an importer. Since the launch date, importers attempting to register have reported difficulty accessing the CARM Client Portal. A warning message on the website stated “The CBSA is experiencing intermittent issues with access to its portals, including the CARM Client Portal (CCP), the eManifest and Canadian Export Reporting System (CERS) portals. We are investigating and will take corrective measures to improve access to the portals as soon as possible.” As of December 31, 2024, CBSA had made no other alternatives available for paying duties and taxes. Many U.S. exporters to Canada previously relied on the “Non-Resident Importer” program to obtain “Release Prior to Payment.” Release Prior to Payment allows goods to physically clear customs while duties and tax payments were being calculated, in compliance with Canada’s World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement commitments. With the launch of CARM, CBSA is offering a 180- day transition period for Release Prior to Payment. After this transition period ends, unless an importer has set up an account in the CARM Client Portal and posted a financial security or cash deposit with CBSA, its goods will be held by customs until payment is made. Because of the transition period, most goods are able to physically clear customs while issues with access to CARM and financial instruments are resolved. However, some categories of imports, such as temporary entries, may be unable to move across the border until the importer’s online accounts are processed. To date, about 100,000 importers have registered in the CARM Client Portal. In recent years, the number of importers of goods into Canada has reached about 160,000 entities. The U.S. Government will continue to monitor this situation. Milk Classes Canada establishes discounted prices for milk components provided to domestic manufacturers of dairy products used in processed food products under the Special Milk Class Permit Program (SMCPP). These prices are “discounted,” as they are lower than regular Canadian milk class prices for manufacturers of dairy products and pegged to U.S. prices or world prices. The SMCPP is designed to help Canadian manufacturers of processed food products compete against processed food imported into Canada and in ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-49-2048.jpg) ![42 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS foreign markets. An agreement reached between Canadian dairy farmers and processors in 2016 introduced a new national milk class (Class 7), with discount pricing for a wide range of Canadian dairy ingredients used in dairy products, to decrease imports of U.S. milk protein substances into Canada and increase Canadian exports of skim milk powder into third country markets. Provincial milk marketing boards (agencies of Canada’s provincial governments) began implementing Class 7 in 2017. Under the USMCA, Canada was obligated to eliminate Class 7 within six months of entry into force. However, U.S. stakeholders have reported continued concerns with Canada’s milk class pricing and dairy exports. In addition, Canada is obligated to ensure that the price for nonfat solids used to manufacture skim milk powder, milk protein concentrates, and infant formula will be no lower than a level based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture price for nonfat dry milk. Transparency provisions obligate Canada to provide information necessary to monitor compliance with these commitments. Canada is obligated to apply charges to exports of skim milk powder, milk protein concentrates, and infant formula in excess of thresholds specified in the USMCA. Ministerial Exemptions Canada prohibits bulk imports of fresh fruits and vegetables in packages exceeding certain sizes (typically 50 kilograms) unless Canada grants a ministerial exemption. To obtain an exemption, importers must demonstrate that the supply of a product in the domestic market is insufficient. The import restrictions apply to all fresh produce in bulk containers if grade names are established in the respective regulations. There are no restrictions on bulk imports of horticultural products without prescribed grade names. In addition, Canadian regulations on fresh fruit and vegetable imports prohibit consignment sales of fresh fruit and vegetables in the absence of a prearranged buyer. The 2007 Technical Arrangement Concerning Trade in Potatoes between the United States and Canada is designed to provide U.S. potato producers with predictable access to Canadian ministerial exemptions. The United States will continue to engage with U.S. potato growers on any concerns that Canada’s procedures for granting ministerial exemptions are not providing access to Canada’s market as agreed. Wine, Beer, and Spirits Most Canadian provinces have province-run liquor control boards, which are the sole authorized sellers of wine, beer, and spirits in those provinces. Market access barriers imposed by Canadian provincial liquor control boards greatly hamper exports of U.S. wine, beer, and spirits to Canada. These barriers include cost-of-service mark-ups, restrictions on listings (products that the liquor board will carry), reference prices (either the maximum prices the liquor board is willing to pay or the prices below which imported products may not be sold), label requirements, discounting policies (requirements that suppliers must offer rebates or reduce their prices to meet sales targets), and distribution policies. Energy According to stakeholders, the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) has provided separate and unequal points of access to the Alberta energy market for Montana energy producers. For example, during times of surplus or transmission congestion, AESO favors electricity generated within Alberta over equally priced U.S. power flowing across the border. The AESO has also proposed additional fees and other restrictions on imported energy. The United States will continue to monitor this issue. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-50-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 43 TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Compositional Standards for Cheese Canada’s regulations on compositional standards for cheese limit the amount of dry milk protein products that can be used in cheese making, reducing the demand for U.S. dry milk protein products. The United States continues to monitor these regulations for any changes that could have a further adverse impact on U.S. dairy product exports. Zero Plastic Waste Agenda In 2018, Canada announced a comprehensive agenda to achieve zero plastic waste by 2030. As part of this agenda, Canada is developing a range of measures to prevent plastic pollution and improve circularity within the Canadian market, including extended producer responsibility, minimum recycled content, compostability and recyclability labeling, and restrictions on the use of single use plastics. The United States supports Canada’s objective of reducing plastic pollution; however, U.S. industry has raised concerns that some aspects of Canada’s program would create negative impacts for trade and the environment. U.S. industry is concerned that without viable alternatives for plastic packaging, Canada’s proposed reductions in food packaging and packaging compostability requirements could compromise food safety, increase food loss and waste, and restrict U.S. agricultural exports. The United States continues to work closely with Canada to encourage the use of science-based approaches to address plastic pollution, including consideration of technological limitations and environmentally sustainable alternatives to plastics. Quebec’s Bill 96 Bill 96 became law in the province of Quebec on June 1, 2022 and is intended to strengthen the use of the French language in the province. U.S. businesses have expressed concerns about the impact that Bill 96 will have on their federally registered trademarks for products manufactured after June 1, 2025, which is when the relevant provisions of Bill 96 enter into force. These businesses will need to review their non- French language trademarks on the products’ packaging and labelling and translate into French any part of their trademark that contains a “generic term” or a “description of the product.” In June 2024, the United States engaged with Canada on Quebec’s Bill 96 at the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade meeting. The United States encouraged the Quebec provincial government to take into consideration business sector concerns and involve businesses in the drafting of further interpretive guidance on this law and the Final Regulation. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Restrictions on U.S. Seeds Exports For many major field crops, Canada’s Seeds Act generally prohibits the sale or advertising for sale in Canada—or import into Canada—of any variety of seed that is not registered with Canada’s Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Canada’s variety registration gives the CFIA an oversight role in maintaining and improving quality standards for grains in Canada. The registration is designed to facilitate and support seed certification and the international trade of seed; verify claims made, which contributes to a fair and accurate representation of varieties in the marketplace; and facilitate varietal identity, trait identity, and traceability in the marketplace to ensure standards are met. The United States is concerned, however, that ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-51-2048.jpg) ![44 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS the variety registration system is slow and cumbersome and disadvantages U.S. seed and grain exports to Canada. Under the Canada Grain Act, only grain of varieties produced from seed of varieties registered under the Seeds Act may receive a grade higher than the lowest grade allowable in each class. The USMCA includes a commitment to discuss issues related to seed regulatory systems. In January 2021, the CFIA began seed regulatory modernization efforts. The United States will continue to discuss with Canada steps to modernize and streamline Canada’s variety registration system. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Canada remained on the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. Canada’s commitments under the USMCA are designed to significantly improve Canada’s intellectual property (IP) environment, addressing areas of longstanding concern, including enforcement against counterfeit goods and online piracy, inspection of goods in-transit, transparency with respect to new geographical indications (GIs), and the broad interpretation of the fair dealing exception for the purpose of education. With respect to GIs, the United States remains highly concerned about countries’ negotiating product-specific IP outcomes as a condition of market access from the European Union and reiterates the importance of each individual IP right being independently evaluated on its individual merits. Poor enforcement with respect to counterfeit or pirated goods at the border and within Canada remains a concern. The Pacific Mall in Toronto is listed in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List) for selling pirated and counterfeit goods. SERVICES BARRIERS Audiovisual Services For cable television and direct-to-home broadcast services, more than 50 percent of the channels received by subscribers must be Canadian channels. Non-Canadian channels must be preapproved (“listed”) by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Alternatively, non-Canadian channels can become Canadian by ceding majority equity control to a Canadian partner, as some U.S. channels have done. Foreign channels are prohibited from owning video distribution infrastructure in Canada. Canada permits Canadian cable and satellite suppliers to pick up the signals of U.S. stations near the border and redistribute them throughout Canada without U.S. broadcasters’ consent. Content owners can apply for compensation for the use of such content in Canada from a statutorily mandated fund into which Canadian cable and satellite suppliers pay. U.S. broadcasters consider this compensation to be insufficient and have sought the right to negotiate the carriage of their signals on commercially set rates and terms, as can be done in the United States. Online Streaming The Canadian Government passed the Online Streaming Act on April 27, 2023, amending the Broadcasting Act to give the CRTC authority to impose conditions on the operation of online streaming platforms. The Canadian Government instructed the CRTC to create a methodology for financial contributions and obligations on streaming platforms to support and promote Canadian programming, and to prioritize a review of how it defines Canadian programs given the foundational nature of these definitions to the regulatory framework. On June 4, 2024, before beginning a review of the definitions, the CRTC announced that streaming services would be required to contribute five percent of their Canadian revenues to support the Canadian broadcasting system, beginning in the broadcast year 2024 to 2025. The rules include criteria that, based on available information, may effectively exclude Canadian streaming services from the new ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-52-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 45 obligations, and under current definitions, would prevent U.S. suppliers from accessing the funding mechanisms that they will pay into. The United States will closely monitor the implementation of the Act and any USCMA implications. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Digital Services Taxation On June 20, 2024, Canada enacted a digital services tax (DST), imposing a three percent levy on certain gross revenues relating to online marketplaces, online targeted advertising, social media platforms, and user data. The DST entered into force on June 28, 2024. Canada’s DST is retroactive to January 1, 2022, and companies are required to remit payments starting on June 30, 2025. The DST applies to taxpayers with annual global revenues of €750 million (approximately $833 million) and Canadian digital services revenue of CA$20 million (approximately $14.3 million). As the United States noted in comments to Canada in 2021 and 2023, most DSTs have been designed in ways that discriminate against U.S. companies, as they single out U.S. firms for taxation while effectively excluding national firms engaged in similar lines of business. Furthermore, Canada’s DST creates significant retroactive tax liabilities with immediate consequences for U.S. companies. Though Canada had joined the October 8, 2021, OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalization of the Economy, which called for all Parties to commit not to introduce DSTs in the future, Canada subsequently declined to join the July 2023 Inclusive Framework “Outcome Statement” that extended that commitment. Through bilateral and multilateral engagement, the United States continued to raise serious concerns regarding Canada’s DST and to encourage Canada to withdraw or repeal the DST. On August 30, 2024, USTR announced that the United States requested dispute settlement consultations with Canada under the USMCA regarding Canada’s DST. On January 20, 2025, the United States issued a White House Memorandum titled, “The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal (Global Tax Deal).” The memorandum stated: The Secretary of the Treasury and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the OECD shall notify the OECD that any commitments made by the prior administration on behalf of the United States with respect to the Global Tax Deal have no force or effect within the United States absent an act by the Congress adopting the relevant provisions of the Global Tax Deal. On January 22, 2025, appropriate representatives of the Treasury Department provided notice to the Director of the Centre of Tax Policy and Administration at the OECD. On January 24, 2025, the U.S. Permanent Delegation to the OECD provided similar notice to the Secretary General of the OECD. Mandatory Bargaining Code On June 22, 2023, the Canadian Government passed the Online News Act (Bill C-18). Under the Act, designated platform services companies are required to engage in negotiations with Canadian news providers to pay the news businesses for content accessed via certain services offered on the companies’ digital platforms. The Act gives the gives the CRTC new powers to regulate the Canadian news industry, including determining who is a journalist, what is an eligible news business, and calculating compensation.

Under this Agreement, as of January 1, 2015, Chile provides duty-free access to all U.S. exports. The United States continues to have significant concerns with Chile’s failure to implement fully some FTA commitments on protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights. The United States and Chile meet regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the Agreement and to address outstanding issues. IMPORT POLICIES Non-Tariff Barriers Certain Cheese and Meat Products On December 13, 2023, Chile and the European Union signed an Advanced Framework Agreement that includes recognition of a number of terms as geographical indications (GIs), which has raised transparency and due process concerns and could undermine market access for U.S. cheese and meat products that rely on common names. Through extensive negotiations, the United States reached an agreement with Chile to provide protections for U.S. producers that export to and sell products in Chile using certain cheese and meat terms. On September 3, 2024, the National Congress of Chile approved the agreement on Chile Market Access and Prior Users for Cheese and Meats, securing ongoing access for U.S. producers. The agreement entered into force on December 29, 2024. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Chile remained on the Priority Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. The United States remains concerned about the adequacy and effectiveness of the protection and enforcement of IP rights in Chile and about the implementation of certain IP obligations under the FTA. Longstanding concerns remain about protections against the unlawful circumvention of technological protection measures, failure to ratify the 1991 Act of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV 1991), and an ineffective internet service provider liability regime that has failed to promote effective and expeditious action against online piracy. The United States also continues to urge Chile to address certain aspects of its FTA commitments on satellite piracy. In addition, pharmaceutical stakeholders continue to raise concerns over the efficacy of Chile’s system for resolving patent issues expeditiously in connection with applications to market pharmaceutical products and over the provision of adequate protection against unfair commercial use, as well as unauthorized disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The United States also continues to encourage Chile to provide transparency and due process to all interested parties in connection with potential recognition or protection of geographical indications, including in connection with trade agreement negotiations.

This agreement included commitments by China to improve market access for the United States in the agriculture and financial services sectors, refrain from problematic policies and practices related to intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, and increase its purchases of certain U.S. goods and services. While China followed through in implementing some provisions of the Phase One Agreement, it has not yet implemented some of the more important commitments. With regard to agriculture trade, for example, the Phase One Agreement addresses many non-tariff barriers and has expanded market access for a variety of U.S. food, agriculture, and seafood product exports. In particular, China implemented significant reforms in some agricultural sub-sectors, such as meat and poultry products, and in facility registration. However, China has not yet implemented some of its more significant agriculture commitments, such as commitments on agricultural biotechnology and the commitment to conduct a risk assessment relating to the use of ractopamine in cattle and swine. At present, serious ongoing concerns with China’s implementation efforts also persist in other areas covered by the agreement, including intellectual property and technology transfer. In addition, official trade data appears to show that China fell far short of implementing its commitments to purchase U.S. goods and services, which covered the years 2020 and 2021. STATE-LED, NON-MARKET TRADE REGIME Industrial Plans China continues to pursue an extensive number of industrial plans and supporting policies and practices that target industries for domination by Chinese companies, both in China and globally. Pursuant to these industrial plans, the Chinese Government offers substantial government guidance, resources and regulatory support to Chinese companies while actively seeking to limit access to the China market for imported goods, foreign manufacturers, and foreign services suppliers. The beneficiaries of these non-market policies and practices, which are constantly evolving, include not only China’s state-owned enterprises but also other Chinese companies. One of the more far-reaching and harmful industrial plans is Made in China 2025. China’s State Council released this industrial plan in May 2015. It is a 10-year plan targeting 10 strategic sectors, which include advanced information technology, automated machine tools and robotics, aviation and aerospace equipment, maritime engineering equipment and high-technology ships, advanced rail transit equipment, new energy vehicles (NEVs), power equipment, agricultural machinery, new materials, biopharmaceuticals, and advanced medical device products. While purportedly intended simply to raise industrial productivity through more advanced and flexible manufacturing techniques, Made in China 2025 is emblematic of China’s evolving and increasingly sophisticated approach to “indigenous innovation,” which is evident in numerous supporting and related industrial plans. Under China’s unfair and anticompetitive approach to indigenous innovation, the overarching objective is to replace foreign technologies, products, and services with Chinese technologies, products, and services in the China market through any means possible so as to enable Chinese companies first to dominate the China market and then to use that dominance as a springboard to dominate global markets. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-56-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 49 Made in China 2025, which covers the first 10 years of a 30-year strategy known as the Strong Manufacturing Nation Strategy, seeks to build up Chinese companies in the 10 targeted sectors at the expense of, and to the detriment of, foreign companies and their technologies, products, and services through a multi-step process from 2015 to 2025. The first objective of Made in China 2025 is to ensure, through various means, that Chinese companies develop their own “indigenous” technologies, IP, and know-how, either through their own efforts or by extracting or acquiring technologies, IP, and know-how from foreign enterprises. The next objective of Made in China 2025 is to substitute domestic technologies, products, and services for foreign technologies, products, and services in the China market. The final objective of Made in China 2025 is to capture much larger worldwide market shares in the 10 targeted sectors. In pursuit of these objectives, subsequently released documents set specific targets for capacity and production levels and market share for the dozens of industries that comprise the 10 broad sectors targeted in Made in China 2025. In October 2015, China’s National Manufacturing Strategic Advisory Committee published the Made in China 2025 Key Area Technology Roadmap, and since then it has published three updated editions of this document. The first update, titled the Made in China 2025 Key Area Technology and Innovation Greenbook – Technology Roadmap (2017), was similar to its predecessor in that it set explicit market share and other targets to be attained by Chinese companies in dozens of high-technology industries, often both in the China market and globally. For example, it calls for “indigenous new energy vehicle annual production” to have a “supplying capacity that can satisfy more than 80 percent of the market” in China by 2020, up from a 70 percent target set in the 2015 document. The two subsequent updates of the Made in China 2025 Key Area Technology and Innovation Greenbook – Technology Roadmap are dated 2019 and 2023. Many of the policy tools being used by the Chinese Government to achieve the industrial targeting objectives of Made in China 2025 raise serious concerns. Several of these tools are unprecedented and include numerous types of state intervention and support that work in concert and are designed to promote the development of Chinese industry in large part by restricting, taking advantage of, discriminating against, or otherwise creating disadvantages for foreign enterprises and their technologies, products, and services. Indeed, even facially neutral measures can be applied in favor of domestic enterprises, as U.S. and other foreign enterprises have experienced, especially at sub-central levels of government. Made in China 2025 also differs from industry support pursued by other World Trade Organization (WTO) Members in its level of ambition and, more importantly, in the scale and type of resources that the Chinese Government has been investing in the pursuit of its industrial plan goals. Indeed, by some estimates, the Chinese Government is making available more than $500 billion of financial support to the Made in China 2025 sectors, often using, among many other vehicles, large “government guidance funds,” which China attempts to shield from scrutiny by claiming that they are run by wholly private entities. Even if China fails to fully achieve all of the objectives set forth in Made in China 2025, it is still likely to create or exacerbate market distortions and critical vulnerabilities, create severe and persistent excess capacity in many of the targeted sectors, and distort investment decisions by foreign companies. It is also likely to do long-lasting damage to U.S. interests, as well as the interests of the United States’ allies and partners, as China-backed companies increase their market share at the expense of foreign companies operating in these sectors. Developing countries, at least some of which have themselves experienced deindustrialization, are especially at risk of severe harm from industrial plans like Made in China 2025. While public references in China to Made in China 2025 subsided after June 2018 reportedly in response to an order from the central government, it is clear that China remains committed to achieving the underlying goals of Made in China 2025 and continues to seek dominance for Chinese firms in the sectors that it views as strategic, both in the China market and in global markets. For example, in September 2020, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-57-2048.jpg) ![50 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS the central government issued a guiding opinion encouraging investment in “strategic emerging industries,” a term used to describe an earlier initiative from which Made in China 2025 evolved. Among other things, the guiding opinion called for the support and creation of industrial clusters for strategic emerging industries, along with the use of various types of government support and funding. The guiding opinion, which is essentially mandatory in China’s system, specifically encouraged provincial and local governments to support industries such as advanced information technology, NEVs, and biopharmaceuticals. The October 2022 Report to the 20th Party Congress also underscored the continuing importance of China’s industrial policy objectives, calling for efforts to promote the development of strategic emerging industries and to “cultivate new growth engines such as next-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, and green industry.” In March 2021, the National People’s Congress approved the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development (the 14th Five-Year Plan), together with the Long-Range Objectives Through Year 2035. The 14th Five-Year Plan and the sector-specific five-year plans subsequently issued by the central government, along with five-year plans issued by sub-central governments, make clear that China will continue to pursue its various industrial domination objectives. While the 14th Five-Year Plan does not explicitly reference Made in China 2025, it nevertheless continues to focus on the sectors identified in Made in China 2025. More recent industrial plans, including those issued by provincial and municipal governments in China, also make clear that China, at various levels of government, is continuing to support these sectors. In addition, longer-ranging industrial plans, such as the New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-2035) and China Standards 2035, reaffirm China’s strong commitment to a state-led, non-market approach to the economy and trade and the pursuit of industrial dominance. Other longer-ranging industrial plans, such as the National Medium to Long-Term Science and Development Plan (2021-2035), the successor to the National Medium to Long-Term Science and Development Plan (2006-2020), are reported to exist but have not been publicly released. In September 2023, China introduced the concept of “new quality productive forces,” which now appears in many official publications and statements. This concept echoes many of China’s existing industrial plans, as it calls for increasing economic productivity through the strengthening of science and technology innovation in order to support “industrial upgrading,” “emerging industries,” and “future industries.” The specific sectors targeted by this concept include many of the same sectors prioritized in Made in China 2025 and other industrial plans related to Made in China 2025, strategic emerging industries, including NEVs, high-end equipment, and high-technology ships. Technology Transfer For years, longstanding and serious U.S. concerns regarding forced or pressured technology transfer remained unresolved, despite repeated, high-level bilateral commitments by China to remove or no longer pursue problematic policies and practices. In August 2017, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) sought to address these concerns by initiating an investigation under Section 301 focused on policies and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, IP, and innovation. Specifically, in its initiation notice, USTR identified four categories of reported Chinese Government conduct that would be the subject of its inquiry: (1) the use of a variety of tools to require or pressure the transfer of technologies and IP to Chinese companies; (2) depriving U.S. companies of the ability to set market-based terms in technology licensing negotiations with Chinese companies; (3) intervention in markets by directing or unfairly facilitating the acquisition of U.S. companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting-edge technologies and IP; and (4) conducting or supporting cyber- enabled theft and unauthorized intrusions into U.S. commercial computer networks for commercial gains. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-58-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 51 In March 2018, USTR issued a report supporting findings that the four categories of acts, policies, and practices covered in the investigation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden and/or restrict U.S. commerce. In November 2018, USTR issued an updated report that found that China had not taken any steps to change its problematic policies and practices. Based on the findings in USTR’s Section 301 investigation, the United States took a range of responsive actions, including the pursuit of a successful WTO dispute challenging certain discriminatory technology licensing measures maintained by China in addition to the imposition of substantial additional tariffs on Chinese imports. The Phase One Agreement, signed in January 2020, addresses certain aspects of the unfair trade practices of China that were identified in USTR’s Section 301 report. In the agreement, among other things, China committed to end its longstanding practice of forcing or pressuring foreign companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies as a condition for obtaining market access, securing administrative approvals, or receiving advantages from the Chinese Government. China also committed to provide transparency, fairness, and due process in administrative proceedings and to ensure that technology transfer and licensing take place on market terms that are voluntary and reflect mutual agreement. Separately, China committed to refrain from directing or supporting outbound investments aimed at acquiring foreign technology pursuant to its distortive industrial plans. Since the entry into force of the Phase One Agreement in February 2020, the United States has continually engaged with the U.S. business community, which has expressed concern about China’s actions, including those that are informal and unwritten, that force or pressure U.S. companies to transfer their technology to Chinese entities, including as a condition for obtaining market access. The United States has engaged China as issues arise and will continue to monitor developments closely. In May 2022, USTR commenced the statutorily mandated four-year review of the tariffs that had been imposed on Chinese imports as a result of the Section 301 investigation into China’s unfair acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, IP, and innovation. As part of this review, USTR examined the effectiveness of the tariff actions in achieving the objectives of the original investigation, other actions that could be taken and the effects of those actions on the United States economy, including consumers. In May 2024, USTR issued a report that found that while the Section 301 tariff actions have been effective in certain respects, China’s unfair acts, policies, and practices had continued and, in some cases, had worsened. Pursuant to the President’s direction, USTR also proposed, and sought comments on, modifications to the existing Section 301 tariffs. In September 2024, in accordance with the President’s direction and after reviewing the public comments, USTR announced the final modifications to the actions, which maintained the current tariffs while increasing tariffs on Chinese products in targeted strategic sectors. In December 2024, USTR announced further modifications, which increased some of the tariffs. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs China’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 7.5 percent in 2023 (latest data available). China’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 14 percent for agricultural products and 6.4 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). China has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the WTO, with a simple average WTO bound tariff rate of 10.0 percent.

The U.S. decision was based on a determination that the quantity and circumstances of U.S. imports of steel and aluminum products‒‒including the circumstances of severe excess capacity and resulting overproduction emanating from China‒‒threaten to impair U.S. national security. In July 2018, the United States launched a dispute settlement proceeding against China in the WTO pertaining to China’s retaliatory tariffs. In August 2023, a WTO panel issued its report, ruling that those retaliatory tariffs were WTO-inconsistent. China appealed the panel’s ruling in September 2023. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect U.S. interests in the face of this type of retaliation. In 2018 and 2019, China imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products following U.S. actions under Section 301 addressing unfair Chinese acts, policies, and practices relating to technology transfer, IP, and innovation. These tariffs remain in place. Tariff-Rate Quota Administration for Agricultural Commodities Market access promised through the tariff-rate quota (TRQ) system set up pursuant to China’s WTO accession agreement has yet to be fully realized as of December 31, 2024. Due to China’s poorly defined criteria for applicants, unclear procedures for distributing TRQ allocations, and failure to announce quota allocation and reallocation results, traders are unsure of available import opportunities and producers worldwide face reduced market access opportunities. As a result, for many years, China’s TRQs for wheat, corn, and rice would seldom fill even when they were oversubscribed. Since 2020, China’s corn and wheat imports have exceeded TRQ levels, but the TRQ issuance, application, and allocation processes still lack transparency, and large state-owned enterprises in China appear to have been the primary beneficiaries of the increased imports. In December 2016, the United States launched a WTO dispute challenging China’s administration of TRQs for wheat, corn, and rice. Consultations took place in February 2017. A WTO panel was established to hear the case at the United States’ request in September 2017, and 17 other WTO Members joined as third parties. The panel issued its report in April 2019, ruling that China’s administration of tariff-rate quotas for wheat, corn, and rice was WTO-inconsistent. In July 2021, the United States submitted a request for authorization to suspend concessions and other obligations pursuant to Article 22 of the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) on the ground that China had failed to bring its measures into compliance with its WTO obligations. After China objected to this request, the matter was referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 22 of the DSU. The arbitration is currently suspended, and the United States continues to closely monitor China’s ongoing administration of the tariff-rate quotas for wheat, corn, and rice. As part of the Phase One Agreement, China agreed that, from December 31, 2019, its administration of TRQs for wheat, corn, and rice would conform to its WTO obligations. In addition, China agreed to make specific improvements to its administration of the wheat, corn, and rice TRQs, including with regard to the allocation methodology, and to the treatment of non-state trading quota applicants. China also committed to greater transparency. As of December 31, 2024, however, China had not demonstrated full implementation of these commitments. Taxes The Chinese Government has attempted to manage imports of primary agricultural commodities by raising or lowering the value-added tax (VAT) rebate to manage domestic supplies. China sometimes reinforces its domestic objectives by imposing or retracting VATs. These practices have caused tremendous distortion and uncertainty in the global markets for wheat, corn, and soybeans, as well as intermediate processed products of these commodities. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-60-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 53 TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Food Safety China’s ongoing implementation of its 2015 Food Safety Law has led to the introduction of myriad new measures, including exporter facility and product registration requirements for almost all food and agricultural products. Overall, China’s notification of these measures to the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Committee) and the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Committee) has been uneven. In November 2019, China’s regulatory authorities issued draft measures for public comment that would require the registration of all foreign food manufacturers. The United States submitted comprehensive written comments on the draft measures to China’s regulatory authorities. The United States also raised concerns about them before the WTO TBT Committee and the WTO SPS Committee. More than 15 WTO Members supported the concerns raised by the United States. In April 2021, China’s regulatory authorities issued final versions of these measures, now known as Decrees 248 and 249, with an implementation date of January 1, 2022. In correspondence delivered to foreign missions in Beijing in September 2021, China’s regulatory authorities laid out a non-transparent, multi-tier system where producers of certain products are required to be registered by foreign regulatory authorities, while producers of other products are eligible to self-register. Decrees 248 and 249 also establish new labeling and conformity assessment requirements. In July 2023, China implemented additional registration requirements for certain products under Decree 248, expanding the burden on foreign food safety regulators. Moreover, the tasks being required of foreign food safety regulators are fundamentally beyond the traditional roles and authority of food safety regulators. These various additional requirements continue to disrupt trade. Decree 248 and similar prior measures continue to place excessive strain on food producers, traders, and exporting countries’ regulatory authorities, with no apparent added benefit to food safety. They instead provide China with a tool to control food imports in accordance with the dictates of China’s state planners, and to retaliate against food producers from countries whose governments challenge Chinese Government policies or practices in non-trade areas. In the Phase One Agreement, China committed that it would not implement food safety regulations that are not science- or risk-based and that it would only apply food safety regulations to the extent necessary to protect human life or health. China also agreed to certain procedures for registering U.S. facilities that produce various food products. Despite repeated U.S. requests for clarification regarding the relationship between the facility registration procedures set forth in the Phase One Agreement and the requirements of Decree 248, China has not provided sufficient information. Technical Barriers to Trade Standards The Chinese Government continues to pursue changes to its standards system, including by moving from a government-led system to one that incorporates both government guidance and stakeholder input. At times, Chinese Government officials have also indicated that they provide equal treatment to foreign companies in connection with China’s standardization work. However, in practice, the Chinese Government continues ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-61-2048.jpg) ![54 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS to limit foreign participation in standards setting and, at times, still pursues unique national standards in order to protect its domestic industry. In January 2018, China’s revised Standardization Law entered into force. Since then, China has issued numerous implementing measures, some of which contain positive references to the ability of foreign- invested enterprises to participate in China’s standardization activities and purport to recognize the value of international standards. Unfortunately, many of these implementing measures cause concern for U.S. industry as they appear to focus on the development of Chinese standards without sufficient consideration being given to existing international standards. In addition, they do not explicitly provide that foreign stakeholders may participate on equal terms with domestic competitors throughout the standardization process. China has sought to increase the use of “association standards” ostensibly to give industry greater participation in standards-making. But the development of association standards is opaque and foreign participation is frequently restricted, depending on the association. In 2023, China issued the Interim Measures on the Adoption of Association Standards as Recommended National Standards to allow for the adoption of such standards in China’s national standards system, which further complicates the ability of foreign companies to participate in Chinese standards development. In May 2024, China published the draft Administrative Measures for the Adoption of International Standards. Given that this draft measure could impact the implementation and administration of China’s obligations under the WTO TBT Agreement, the United States has requested that China notify it to the TBT Committee. As these implementing measures have been issued, China’s existing technical committees have continued to develop standards. U.S. and other foreign companies have reported that they are often not permitted to participate in these domestic technical committees, and even in technical committees where participation has been possible for some foreign stakeholders, it has typically been on terms less favorable than those applicable to their domestic competitors. For example, the technical committee for cybersecurity standards (known as TC-260) allows foreign companies to participate in standards development and setting, with several U.S. and other foreign companies being allowed to participate in some of the TC-260 working groups. However, foreign companies report that they are sometimes excluded from serving on technical committees, and submitting comments on draft standards on the basis that their companies are headquartered outside of China. They also report challenges to participating in key aspects of the standardization process, such as drafting. In addition, they remain prohibited from participating in certain TC-260 working groups, such as the working group on encryption standards. Over the years, U.S. stakeholders have also reported that, in some cases, Chinese Government officials have pressured foreign companies seeking to participate in China’s domestic standards-setting processes to license their technology or IP on unfavorable terms. In addition, China has continued to pursue unique national standards in a number of high technology areas. The United States continues to press China to address these specific concerns, but this bilateral engagement has yielded minimal progress. Notably, U.S. concerns about China’s standards regime are not limited to the implications for U.S. companies’ access to China’s market. China’s ongoing efforts to develop unique national standards aim ultimately to serve the interests of Chinese companies seeking to compete globally, as the Chinese Government’s vision is to use the power of its large domestic market to influence the development of international standards. This strategy can be seen in reports of China offering incentives to companies and individuals for standards proposals in international standards-setting bodies. While the quality of these proposals varies in terms of technical merit, China continues to introduce new standards in the international standards arena, notably in the ICT space, and industry has reported that some of the proposed standards do not have practical need or use. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-62-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 55 In October 2021, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the State Council issued the Outline for the Development of National Standardization, which set targets for China’s standardization system. It reiterates the desire for China’s standardization system to be both guided by the government and driven by the market. It also calls for China’s standardization system to refocus from quantity to quality and to shift from a domestic focus to an equal domestic and international focus. The October 2021 Outline for the Development of National Standardization is partly based on an initiative that China announced in 2019, known as China Standards 2035. A lack of transparency with regard to the initiative’s objectives is troubling, particularly given longstanding global concerns about discriminatory limitations of foreign participation in China’s standards-setting processes, China’s use of unique national standards without basis, and certain licensing practices in China’s standards-setting processes. The United States remains very concerned about China’s policies with regard to standards and has expressed concerns to China bilaterally and multilaterally as China continues to develop and issue implementing measures for its revised Standardization Law. Cosmetics Over the past several years, the United States and U.S. industry have engaged with China’s Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) and its successor, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), to highlight serious concerns with China’s regulation of cosmetics. Currently, the regulation of cosmetics in China is governed by the Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR), which was issued in June 2020 and entered into effect in January 2021. The United States has repeatedly raised serious concerns with the CSAR and its numerous implementing measures, both bilaterally and in meetings of the WTO TBT Committee and the WTO Council for Trade in Goods, as have several other WTO Members. The CSAR implementing measures contain provisions that would require companies to disclose full product formulations, ingredient suppliers, manufacturing methods, claims, and safety data to both NMPA and local agents in China when products are registered or notified. In addition, these measures require companies to publish claims abstracts that may contain trade secrets and confidential business information on NMPA’s website. The United States has expressed concern to China that its regulators are applying an approach that treats cosmetics as having much higher safety risks than is warranted. China’s filing and registration requirements for cosmetics also significantly diverge from those in other major markets without adequate justification, making compliance very burdensome for exporters. The United States is particularly concerned that the CSAR implementing measures do not provide adequate assurances as to how undisclosed information, trade secrets and confidential business information will be protected from unauthorized disclosure. China also has not addressed requests from the United States and cosmetics right holders that NMPA provide a legally enforceable mechanism to monitor and protect the trade secrets and confidential business information typically identified by companies in their cosmetics filings. In addition, China continues to require duplicative in-country testing to assess many product and ingredient safety and performance claims, without considering the applicability of international data or other means of establishing conformity. In response to U.S. concerns, China indicated that it would allow foreign laboratories with facilities in China to conduct its required testing. However, this change does not address the burden of China’s requirement, which does not consider the applicability of testing conducted via internationally recognized laboratories outside of China, as well as other means used by foreign regulators and industries to assess the conformity of product and ingredient safety and performance claims. The United States also questions China’s assertion that its cosmetics good manufacturing practices (GMP) requirements provide equal treatment for imported and domestic general and special cosmetics. If the ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-63-2048.jpg) ![56 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS government of a cosmetics importer does not issue GMP or manufacturing export certificates, the only means that China provides to establish conformity with China’s GMP for general cosmetics is animal testing. The United States and other WTO Members have made repeated requests that China consider the many alternative means available to establish GMP conformity, including utilizing second party or third party certificates based upon international GMP standards, such as ISO 22716 guidelines on GMP. Although China accepts some GMP certificates issued by U.S. state governments, the process remains inconsistent and uncertain for exporters. Some foreign companies who manufacture outside of China have been able to access China’s cosmetics market through cross-border electronic commerce channels without needing to go through some of the burdensome regulatory requirements, such as animal testing. However, access to the Chinese market through these channels is limited and there have been indications that requirements for electronic commerce goods may tighten in the future. In sum, after years of the United States engaging with China bilaterally and via, the WTO and other fora to press for clarity, express concerns, and share expertise regarding the regulation of cosmetics, China has not yet addressed key U.S. concerns, including the use of good regulatory practices to facilitate cosmetics conformity assessment and avoid discriminatory treatment, nor has it provided confidence that U.S. IP will be protected. Until China addresses these concerns, which have not changed over the course of 2024, many U.S. companies will be impeded in accessing, or simply unable to access, the China market. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Overview China remains a difficult and unpredictable market for U.S. agricultural exporters, largely because of inconsistent enforcement of regulations and selective intervention in the market by China’s regulatory authorities. China’s unwillingness to routinely base its measures on science-based risk assessment or international standards and guidelines and to apply regulatory enforcement in a transparent and rules-based manner further complicates and impedes agricultural trade. Agricultural Biotechnology Approvals The Chinese regulatory approval process for agricultural biotechnology products creates significant uncertainty among developers and traders, slowing commercialization of products and creating adverse trade impacts, particularly for U.S. exports of corn, soy, canola, alfalfa, and potatoes. Despite some recent product approvals, the process remains lengthy and opaque and continues to reflect significant asynchrony relative to approvals issued by regulatory authorities in many other countries. For many years, biotechnology product approvals by China’s regulatory authorities mainly materialized only after high-level political intervention. In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to implement a transparent, predictable, efficient, and science- and risk-based system for the review of products of agricultural biotechnology. In the agreement, China also committed to improve its regulatory authorization process for agricultural biotechnology products, including by completing reviews of products for use as animal feed or further processing within an average of no more than 24 months and by improving the transparency of its review process. China also agreed to work with importers and the U.S. Government to address situations involving low-level presence of genetically engineered (GE) materials in shipments. In addition, China agreed to establish a regulatory approval process for all food ingredients derived from genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), rather than continue to restrict market access to GMM- derived enzymes only. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-64-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 57 Since 2021, China’s National Biosafety Committee (NBC) has issued biosafety certificates to foreign developers for several new GE products for import as feed or for processing, including alfalfa, canola, corn, cotton, soybean, and sugarcane products. Some of these approved products had been under review for more than 10 years. During the same time period, China has issued biosafety certificates to Chinese developers for dozens of new corn, cotton, and soybean varieties for domestic cultivation, including both transgenic and genome-edited products. China’s commitments related to agricultural biotechnology are among the most significant commitments under the Phase One Agreement, but they remain unfulfilled. Despite the commitments that China made, there remains a significant lack of transparency regarding the procedures for convening meetings of the NBC, including regarding dates and agenda items for these meetings and the process for notifying applicants of outcomes and for soliciting additional information to support product applications. While the NBC is required to meet at least two times each year, the meetings are not held pursuant to a regular schedule, and information about the meetings is not widely shared with the public in a transparent and predictable manner. In addition, in conducting its approval process, China continues to ask for information that is not relevant to a product’s intended use or information that applicants have previously provided. For this and other reasons, China has not reduced the average time for its approval process for agricultural biotechnology products for feed or further processing to no more than 24 months. Poultry In the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to maintain measures consistent with the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) guidelines for future outbreaks of avian influenza. China also agreed to sign a regionalization protocol within 30 days of entry into force of the agreement, which it did, to help avoid unwarranted nationwide animal disease restrictions in the future. This protocol requires that China resume acceptance of poultry imports from states with high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) detections within five days of receiving a U.S. report that the states are HPAI-free. Following the implementation of the protocol, China initially complied with its terms. Starting in February 2022, the United States notified China of detections of HPAI in multiple U.S. states. In the ensuing months, several states recovered from these detections, and they were deemed HPAI-free by the United States. The United States submitted reports to China for these states and requested approval to resume exporting poultry from these states to China. In November 2023, China removed restrictions on seven U.S. states, but numerous other HPAI-free U.S. states remain restricted. As of December 31, 2024, China had yet to confirm the restoration of market access for the majority of the impacted U.S. states. Pork China maintains an approach to U.S. pork that appears to be inconsistent with international standards, limiting the potential of an important export market given China’s growing meat consumption. Specifically, China bans the use of certain veterinary drugs and growth promotants for which there are maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by Codex Alimentarius (Codex). As part of the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to broaden the list of pork products that are eligible for importation, including processed products such as ham and certain types of offal that are inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service for both domestic and international trade. China also agreed to conduct a risk assessment for ractopamine in swine and cattle as soon as possible and to establish a joint working group with the United States to discuss next steps based on the risk assessment. As of December 31, 2024, China has not completed the risk assessment and therefore has not yet made any progress on next steps based on the risk assessment, which will need to include the establishment of MRLs or import tolerances. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-65-2048.jpg) ![58 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Since 2022, China has rejected shipments from certain U.S. pork facilities and subjected subsequent shipments from these facilities to increased inspections due to alleged detections of animal diseases, such as porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome and Seneca Valley virus. Certain common testing techniques are known to show false positives when the animals being tested have received vaccinations against these animal diseases. In addition, these animal diseases are endemic in China and pose no threat to human health, and China has not identified any standard or regulation that the shipments in question violated, nor has China identified a pathway for shipments from these facilities to resume normal customs clearance procedures. Beef In the Phase One Agreement, China agreed to expand the scope of U.S. beef products allowed to be imported, to eliminate age restrictions on cattle slaughtered for export to China and to recognize the U.S. beef and beef products’ traceability system. China also agreed to establish MRLs consistent with Codex standards and guidelines for three synthetic hormones legally used for decades in the United States. Where Codex standards and guidelines do not yet exist, China agreed to use MRLs established by other countries that have performed science-based risk assessments. While China confirmed to the United States that it had adopted Codex-consistent MRLs for use of the three synthetic hormones in beef, China still has not published the MRLs. The lack of publication contributes to regulatory ambiguity for U.S. beef producers and traders. China’s failure to publish the MRLs is another example of China’s inadequate implementation of the Phase One Agreement. As previously noted, China also made a commitment in the Phase One Agreement to complete a risk assessment for ractopamine in swine and cattle, but it has not yet followed through. Meanwhile, in 2022, China began rejecting certain shipments of U.S. beef products due to alleged findings of the veterinary drug ractopamine. China subsequently suspended the U.S. facilities that produced these products from exporting to China. In several cases, China also suspended the cold storage facilities that had handled the products immediately prior to shipping, despite the fact that these cold storage facilities have no role in raising or feeding cattle or in processing beef products. The cold storage facility suspensions imposed by China also restrict exports of unrelated products, such as poultry and pork products. As of December 31, 2024, China had not outlined a process for the relisting of any of the impacted facilities as eligible to export to China. The Phase One Agreement requires China to “accept meat, poultry meat, and processed meat and poultry meat . . . inspected by the FSIS . . . and accompanied by an FSIS Export Certificate of Wholesomeness.” China may refuse to accept shipments from a facility if “China determines that there is “a significant, sustained or recurring pattern of non-conformity . . . until the problem is resolved.” In each of the cases in question, China suspended the facilities after a single isolated incident and has not lifted the suspensions even after USDA explained the new mitigation measures implemented by each of the impacted facilities. The United States will continue to closely monitor China’s actions in this area. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT In its WTO accession agreement, China made a commitment to initiate negotiations to accede to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) and to open up its vast government procurement market to the United States and other GPA Parties. More than two decades later, this commitment remains unfulfilled, while China’s government procurement has continued to grow. Even though it has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since February 2002, China has still not become a party to the GPA. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-66-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 59 The United States, the European Union and other GPA Parties have viewed China’s GPA offers over the years as highly disappointing in scope and coverage. China submitted its sixth revised offer in October 2019 and significant deficiencies remain in a number of critical areas. China’s most recent submission, made in June 2021, was an update of its checklist of issues, which informs GPA Parties of changes to China’s existing government procurement regime since its last update. China’s current government procurement regime is governed by two important laws. The Government Procurement Law, administered by the Ministry of Finance, governs purchasing activities conducted with fiscal funds by state organs and other organizations at all levels of government in China, but does not apply to procurements by state-owned enterprises. The Tendering and Bidding Law falls under the jurisdiction of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and imposes uniform tendering and bidding procedures for certain classes of procurement projects in China, notably construction and works projects, without regard for the type of entity (e.g., a government agency or a state-owned enterprise) that conducts the procurement. Both laws cover important procurements that GPA Parties would consider to be government procurement eligible for coverage under the GPA. China’s Foreign Investment Law, which entered into force in January 2020, and the related October 2021 Ministry of Finance Notice 35, state that China will provide equal treatment to foreign companies invested in China and to domestic Chinese companies with regard to government procurement opportunities. However, foreign companies report a marked increase in preference for domestic Chinese companies over foreign companies invested in China. In July 2022, the Ministry of Finance issued draft amendments to the Government Procurement Law. Among other changes, these draft amendments would codify the requirement that officials at all levels of government refrain from purchasing foreign products whenever domestic products are available. The draft amendments, which have not yet been finalized, do not define the term “domestic product.” In December 2024, the Ministry of Finance published the “Notice on Matters Related to Domestic Product Standards and Implementation Policies in the Field of Government Procurement,” which includes a definition of “domestic product” and outlines benefits for eligible products in government procurement. In August 2023, China’s State Council issued the Opinions on Further Optimizing the Foreign Investment Environment and Enhancing the Attraction of Foreign Investment, known as Document 11. One of the 24 topics addressed in Document 11 is government procurement. Specifically, Article 6 of Document 11 offers various suggestions for how central level ministries and sub-central government authorities could work to ensure that foreign-invested enterprises can participate in China’s government procurement market, consistent with existing Chinese law. In Article 6, the State Council recommends clarifying the meaning of “produced in China” as it relates to China’s government procurement laws and regulations and providing unspecified support for foreign-invested enterprises to encourage them to develop their cutting-edge products in China. While China’s leadership has touted Document 11 to the foreign business community as a demonstration of China’s sincerity about fostering a more welcoming environment for foreign companies in China, Document 11 provides little clarity as to how its suggestions would be implemented, nor does it identify timelines for acting on them. Going forward, the United States expects China to make any forthcoming draft implementing measures accessible to the public, including the foreign business community, and to provide a reasonable period of time to submit comments on them. Under both its government procurement regime and its tendering and bidding regime, China continues to implement policies favoring products, services, and technologies made or developed by Chinese-owned and Chinese-controlled companies through explicit and implicit requirements that hamper foreign companies from fairly competing in China. For example, foreign companies continue to report cases in which “domestic brands” and “indigenous designs” are required in tendering documents. Since China has ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-67-2048.jpg) ![60 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS not yet adopted clear rules on what constitutes a “domestic product,” procurement officials often prefer to err on the side of caution and purchase products from domestic Chinese companies. In December 2024, China’s Ministry of Finance issued for public comment the Notice on Matters Concerning Domestic Product Standards and Implementation Policies in the Field of Government Procurement (Draft for Comments). This draft measure provides that for a product to be eligible for certain benefits, the product must meet several criteria, including that it must be manufactured within China’s territory, the cost of components produced in China must meet the prescribed proportion requirements that will be determined on a sector-by-sector basis, and it must comply with requirements for domestic manufacturing of certain key components and processes of specific products. The draft measure also provides that products meeting these criteria will receive a 20 percent price deduction applied to the bidding price for evaluation purposes in government procurement activities where both domestic and non-domestic products compete. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Overview After its accession to the WTO, China undertook a wide-ranging revision of its framework of laws and regulations aimed at protecting the IP rights of domestic and foreign right holders, as required by the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement). Despite various plans and directives issued by the State Council, inadequacies in China’s IP protection and enforcement regime continue to present serious barriers to U.S. exports and investment. As a result, as in the previous year, China was again placed on the Priority Watch List in USTR’s 2024 Special 301 Report. In addition, in January 2025, USTR announced the results of its 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List), which identifies online and physical markets that exemplify key challenges in the global struggle against piracy and counterfeiting and explains the harm not only to U.S. businesses, but also to U.S. workers. Several markets in China were among those named as notorious markets, as China continues to be the number one source of pirated and counterfeit products in the world. The Phase One Agreement addresses numerous longstanding U.S. concerns relating to China’s inadequate IP protection and enforcement. Specifically, the agreement requires China to revise its legal and regulatory regimes in a number of ways in the areas of trade secrets, pharmaceutical-related IP, patents, trademarks, and geographical indications. In addition, the agreement requires China to make numerous changes to its judicial procedures and to establish deterrent-level penalties. China must also take a number of steps to strengthen enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods, including in the online environment, at physical markets and at the border. China has published a number of draft measures for comment and issued some final measures relating to implementation of the IP chapter of the Phase One Agreement. Notably, China amended the Patent Law, the Copyright Law and the Criminal Law. At the same time, U.S. right holders have expressed serious concerns about some final measures that lack details and leave too much discretion with the enforcement authorities, which creates uncertainties and can lead to inconsistencies in the scope of coverage and the availability and nature of relief. In addition, China has outstanding work to finalize the draft measures that it has published and to publish other draft measures in accordance with the Intellectual Property Action Plan that it released in April 2020. Outstanding areas to be addressed include areas such as: the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information from unauthorized disclosures by government personnel and third-party experts; criminal enforcement of trade secrets theft; enforcement procedures to combat online infringement, including an effective notice and takedown system; the protection and ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-68-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 61 enforcement of trademark rights, particularly against bad faith trademark registrations; increases in the minimum and maximum levels of statutory damages and criminal penalties for IP infringement; patent term extensions for unreasonable marketing approval delays; and geographical indications. Meanwhile, in connection with the Phase One Agreement, China has reported increased enforcement actions against counterfeit medicines and increased customs actions against pirated and counterfeit goods. However, China has yet to demonstrate that it has taken the following actions: (1) published data online regarding enforcement actions against counterfeit goods with health and safety risks, enforcement actions at physical markets, and enforcement actions at the border; (2) increased enforcement actions against counterfeits with health and safety risks and at physical markets; (3) increased training of customs personnel; or (4) ensured the use of only licensed software in government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Going forward, the United States will continue to monitor China’s implementation of the IP chapter of the Phase One Agreement. The United States will also assess the impact of the final measures that have been issued by China and the enforcement actions that China takes. Trade Secrets Serious inadequacies in the protection and enforcement of trade secrets in China have been the subject of high-profile engagement between the United States and China in recent years. Several instances of trade secret theft for the benefit of Chinese companies have occurred both within China and outside of China. Offenders in many cases continue to operate with impunity. Particularly troubling are reports that actors affiliated with the Chinese Government and the Chinese military have infiltrated the computer systems of U.S. companies, stealing terabytes of data, including the companies’ proprietary information and IP, for the purpose of providing commercial advantages to Chinese enterprises. In high-level bilateral dialogues with the United States over the years, China has committed to issue judicial guidance to strengthen its trade secrets regime. China has also committed not to condone state-sponsored misappropriation of trade secrets for commercial use. In addition, the United States has urged China to make certain key amendments to its trade secrets-related laws and regulations, particularly with regard to a draft revision of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law. The United States has also urged China to take actions to address inadequacies across the range of state-sponsored actors and to promote public awareness of trade secrets disciplines. At the November 2016 U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) meeting, China claimed that it was strengthening its trade secrets regime and bolstering several areas of importance, including the availability of evidence preservation orders and damages based on market value as well as the issuance of a judicial interpretation on preliminary injunctions and other matters. China amended the Anti-Unfair Competition Law, effective January 2018 and April 2019, as well as the Administrative Licensing Law, effective April 2019, and the Foreign Investment Law, effective January 2020. Nevertheless, the amendments still do not fully address critical shortcomings in the scope of protections and obstacles to enforcement. In 2022, China published additional draft amendments to the Anti-Unfair Competition Law, but they contain few changes to the law’s trade secrets provisions. The Phase One Agreement significantly strengthens protections for trade secrets and enforcement against trade secret theft in China. In particular, the chapter on IP requires China to expand the scope of civil liability for misappropriation beyond entities directly involved in the manufacture or sale of goods and services, to cover acts such as electronic intrusions as prohibited acts of trade secret theft and to shift the burden of proof in civil cases to the defendants when there is a reasonable indication of trade secret theft. It also requires China to make it easier for right holders to obtain preliminary injunctions to prevent the use ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-69-2048.jpg) ![62 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS of stolen trade secrets, to allow for initiation of criminal investigations without the need to show actual losses, to ensure that criminal enforcement is available for willful trade secret misappropriation, and to prohibit government personnel and third party experts and advisors from engaging in the unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed information, trade secrets, and confidential business information submitted to the government. In 2020, China published various measures relating to civil, criminal, and administrative enforcement of trade secrets. In September 2020, the Supreme People’s Court issued the Provisions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Civil Cases of Trade Secret Infringement and the Interpretation III on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. In September 2020, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security also issued the Decision on Amendment of Docketing for Prosecution of Criminal Trade Secrets Infringement Cases Standards. These measures relate to issues such as the scope of liability for trade secret misappropriation, prohibited acts of trade secret theft, preliminary injunctions, and thresholds for initiations of criminal investigations for trade secret theft. In December 2020, the National People’s Congress passed amendments to the Criminal Law that included changes to the thresholds for criminal investigation and prosecution and the scope of criminal acts of trade secret theft. The Criminal Law amendments require revisions to certain previously issued judicial interpretations and prosecution standards. However, three years after the passage of the Criminal Law amendments, these other measures remain unchanged, and implementation of the Criminal Law amendments therefore remains incomplete. Indeed, China has only published a draft judicial interpretation. The United States will continue to monitor the effectiveness of all of these measures. Bad Faith Trademark Registration The continuing registration of trademarks in bad faith in China remains a significant concern. For example, “trademark squatters” attempt to take advantage when a genuine trademark owner has not yet registered its trademark in China by registering that trademark and then trying to sell it to the genuine trademark owner. Bad faith trademark registration also occurs when trademarks intending to deceive or confuse consumers are registered. At the November 2016 JCCT meeting, China publicly noted the harm that can be caused by bad faith trademarks and asserted that it was taking further steps to combat bad faith trademark filings. Amendments to the Trademark Law made in 2019 and subsequent implementing measures, including the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) Provisions on Standardizing Applications for Registrations of Trademarks issued in 2019 and the Trademark Examination and Review Guidelines updated in 2021 by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), require the disallowance of bad faith trademark applications. In January 2023, China proposed further amendments to the Trademark Law regarding bad faith trademarks. However, implementation in this area by China suggests that right holders remain insufficiently protected, as bad faith trademarks remain widespread and problems persist with the large number of inconsistent decisions, low rate of success for oppositions, lack of transparency in opposition proceedings, and unavailability of default judgments against applicants who fail to appear in proceedings. Onerous documentation requirements are also an ongoing concern for right holders. China acceded to the Convention of 5 October 1961 Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents (Apostille Convention), effective November 2023. The United States will monitor China’s implementation of the obligations under the Apostille Convention and whether it addresses right holders’ concerns regarding foreign government document legalization requirements. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-70-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 63 As a result of these deficiencies, U.S. companies across industry sectors continue to face Chinese applicants registering their marks and “holding them for ransom” or seeking to establish a business building off of U.S. companies’ global reputations. The Phase One Agreement requires China to ensure adequate and effective protection and enforcement of trademark rights, particularly against bad faith trademark registrations. The United States will continue to closely monitor developments in this area of long-standing concern. Online Infringement Online piracy continues on a large scale in China, affecting a wide range of industries, including those involved in distributing legitimate music, motion pictures, books and journals, software, and video games. While increased enforcement activities have helped stem the flow of online sales of some pirated offerings, much more sustained action and attention is needed to make a meaningful difference for content creators and right holders, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reports indicate that many infringers have moved online to distribute their pirated and counterfeit goods, which further increases the need for targeted and sustained enforcement measures in the online environment. The United States has urged China to consider ways to create a broader policy environment to help foster the growth of healthy markets for licensed and legitimate content. The United States has also urged China to revise existing rules that have proven to be counterproductive. At the November 2016 JCCT meeting, China agreed to actively promote electronic commerce-related legislation, strengthen supervision over online infringement and counterfeiting, and work with the United States to explore the use of new approaches to enhance online enforcement capacity. In December 2016 and November 2017, China published drafts of a new E-Commerce Law for public comment. In written comments, the United States stressed that the final version of this law should not undermine the existing notice-and-takedown system and should promote effective cooperation in deterring online infringement. In August 2018, China adopted its new E-Commerce Law, which entered into force in January 2019. This law was an opportunity for China to institute strong provisions on IP protection and enforcement for its electronic commerce market, which is now the largest in the world. However, as finalized, the law instead introduced provisions that weaken the ability of right holders to protect their rights online and that reduce the liability of China-based electronic commerce platforms for selling counterfeit and other infringing goods. The Phase One Agreement requires China to provide enforcement procedures that permit effective and expeditious action against infringement in the online environment, including by requiring expeditious takedowns and by ensuring the validity of takedown notices and counter-notifications. It also requires China to take effective action against electronic commerce platforms that fail to take necessary measures against infringement. In May 2020, the National People’s Congress issued the Civil Code, which included updated notice-and- takedown provisions. In September 2020, the Supreme People’s Court issued Guiding Opinions on Hearing Intellectual Property Disputes Involving E-Commerce Platforms and the Official Reply on the Application of Law in Network-Related Intellectual Property Infringement Disputes. These measures relate to issues such as expeditious takedowns and the validity of notices and counter-notifications, but have only recently taken effect. In November 2020, the National People’s Congress adopted long-pending amendments to the Copyright Law, including provisions relating to increasing civil remedies for copyright infringement, new rights of public performance and broadcasting for producers of sound recordings, and protections against the circumvention of technological protection measures. Right holders have welcomed these developments ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-71-2048.jpg) ![64 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS but have noted the need for effective implementation as well as new measures to address online piracy. The United States will closely monitor the impact of these measures going forward. In August 2021, SAMR issued draft amendments to the E-Commerce Law for public comment. These draft amendments further attempt to address concerns that have been raised about procedures and penalties under China’s notice-and-takedown system. Counterfeit Goods Counterfeiting in China remains widespread and affects a wide range of goods. In April 2019, China amended its Trademark Law, effective November 2019, to require civil courts to order the destruction of counterfeit goods, but these amendments still do not provide the full scope of civil remedies for right holders. One of many areas of particular U.S. concern involves medications. Despite years of sustained engagement by the United States, China has failed to adequately improve its regulation of the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients to prevent their use in counterfeit and substandard medications. At the July 2014 meeting of the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), China committed to develop and seriously consider amendments to the Drug Administration Law that will require regulatory control of the manufacturers of bulk chemicals that can be used as active pharmaceutical ingredients. At the June 2015 S&ED meeting, China further committed to publish revisions to the Drug Administration Law in draft form for public comment and to consider the views of the United States and other relevant stakeholders. In October 2017, China published limited draft revisions to the Drug Administration Law and stated that future proposed revisions to the remainder of this law would be forthcoming. Although the final Drug Administration Law, issued in August 2019, requires pharmaceuticals products and active pharmaceutical ingredients to meet manufacturing standards, it remains unclear how these requirements will be implemented or enforced. The Phase One Agreement requires China to take effective enforcement action against counterfeit pharmaceuticals and related products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, and to significantly increase actions to stop the manufacture and distribution of counterfeits with significant health or safety risks. The agreement also requires China to provide that its judicial authorities shall order the forfeiture and destruction of pirated and counterfeit goods, along with the materials and implements predominantly used in their manufacture. In addition, the agreement requires China to significantly increase the number of enforcement actions at physical markets in China and against goods that are exported or in transit. It further requires China to ensure, through third party audits, that government agencies and state-owned enterprises only use licensed software. In August 2020, SAMR issued the Opinions on Strengthening the Destruction of Infringing and Counterfeit Goods, and the State Council amended the Provisions on the Transfer of Suspected Criminal Cases by Administrative Organs for Law Enforcement, which relate to the transfer of IP cases from administrative authorities to criminal authorities. China has reported increased enforcement actions against counterfeit medicines and increased customs actions against pirated and counterfeit goods, but has yet to demonstrate that it has increased enforcement actions against counterfeits with health and safety risks and at physical markets, increased training of customs personnel, transferred more cases for criminal prosecution, and ensured the use of only licensed software in government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Indigenous Innovation Policies aimed at promoting China’s “indigenous innovation” continue to represent an important component of China’s industrialization efforts. Through intensive, high-level bilateral engagement with China since 2009, the United States has attempted to address these policies, which provide various preferences when IP is owned or developed in China, both broadly across sectors of China’s economy and ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-72-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 65 specifically in the government procurement context. For example, at the May 2012 S&ED meeting, China committed to treat IP owned or developed in other countries the same as IP owned or developed in China. The United States also used the JCCT process in 2012 and subsequent discussions to press China to revise or eliminate specific measures that appeared to be inconsistent with this commitment. At the December 2014 JCCT meeting, China clarified and underscored that it will treat IP owned or developed in other countries in the same manner as domestically owned or developed IP. However, these commitments have not been fulfilled. China continues to pursue myriad policies that require or favor the ownership or development of IP in China. The United States secured a series of similar commitments from China in the government procurement context, where China agreed to de-link indigenous innovation policies at all levels of the Chinese Government from government procurement preferences, including through the issuance of a State Council measure mandating that provincial and local governments eliminate any remaining linkages by December 2011. Many years later, however, this promise had not been fulfilled. At the November 2016 JCCT meeting, in response to U.S. concerns regarding the continued issuance of scores of inconsistent measures, China announced that its State Council had issued a document requiring all agencies and all sub-central governments to “further clean up related measures linking indigenous innovation policy to the provision of government procurement preference.” Over the years, the underlying thrust of China’s indigenous innovation policies has remained unchanged, as China’s leadership has continued to emphasize the necessity of advancing indigenous innovation capabilities. Through plans such as the 14th Five-Year Plan for the Protection and Utilization of National Intellectual Property Rights, China has continued to implement discriminatory policies encouraging “indigenous IP rights” and “core technologies” that are owned or developed in China. Accordingly, USTR has used mechanisms like a Section 301 investigation to seek to address, among other things, China’s use of indigenous innovation policies that effectively force or pressure foreigners to transfer their technologies to Chinese companies or develop their IP in China. SERVICES BARRIERS Overview The prospects for U.S. service suppliers in China should be promising, given the size of China’s market. Nevertheless, the U.S. share of China’s services market remains well below the U.S. share of the global services market, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) continues to rate China’s services regime as one of the more restrictive among the world’s major economies. In 2024, numerous challenges persisted in a number of services sectors. As in past years, Chinese regulators continued to use discriminatory regulatory processes, informal bans on entry and expansion, case-by-case approvals in some services sectors, overly burdensome licensing and operating requirements, and other means to frustrate the efforts of U.S. suppliers of services to achieve their full market potential in China. These policies and practices affect U.S. service suppliers across a wide range of sectors, including cloud computing, telecommunications, film production and distribution, online video and entertainment services, express delivery, and legal services. In addition, China’s Cybersecurity Law and related implementing measures include mandates to purchase domestic information and communications technology (ICT) products and services, while China’s Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law, and Personal Information Protection Law, as well as related implementing measures include excessive restrictions on cross-border data flows, and excessive requirements to store and process data locally. These types of data measures undermine U.S. services suppliers’ ability to take advantage of market access opportunities in China by prohibiting or severely restricting cross-border transfers of information that are routine in the ordinary ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-73-2048.jpg) ![66 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS course of business and are fundamental to any business activity. China’s data localization requirements also raise concerns about state surveillance. In addition, China has failed to fully address U.S. concerns in areas that have been the subject of WTO dispute settlement, including electronic payment services and theatrical film importation and distribution. The Phase One Agreement addresses a number of longstanding trade and investment barriers to U.S. providers of a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, securities, asset management, credit rating and electronic payment services, among others. The barriers addressed in the agreement include joint venture requirements, foreign equity limitations and various discriminatory regulatory requirements. Removal of these barriers is designed to allow U.S. financial service providers to compete on a more level playing field and expand their services export offerings in the China market. Nevertheless, China’s excessive restrictions on cross-border data flows and data localization requirements could continue to create significant challenges for U.S. financial service providers in China. Banking Services Although China has opened its banking sector to foreign competition in the form of wholly foreign-owned banks, China has maintained restrictions on market access in other ways. These restrictions have kept foreign banks from establishing, expanding, and obtaining significant market share in China, including through capital controls and minimum asset thresholds. Some years ago, China did take some steps to ease or remove market access restrictions. For example, China removed a number of long-standing barriers for foreign banks, including the $10 billion minimum asset requirement for establishing a foreign bank in China and the $20 billion minimum asset requirement for setting up a Chinese branch of a foreign bank. China also removed the cap on the equity interest that a single foreign investor can hold in a Chinese-owned bank. In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to expand opportunities for U.S. financial institutions, including bank branches, to supply securities investment fund custody services by considering their global assets when they seek licenses. China also agreed to review and approve qualified applications by U.S. financial institutions for securities investment fund custody licenses on an expeditious basis. In addition, China committed to consider the international qualifications of U.S. financial institutions when evaluating license applications for Type-A lead underwriting services for all types of non-financial debt instruments in China. The United States will continue to monitor these developments. Securities, Asset Management and Futures Services In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to remove the foreign equity caps in the securities, asset management and futures sectors by no later than April 1, 2020. It also committed to ensure that U.S. suppliers of securities, asset management and futures services are able to access China’s market on a non- discriminatory basis, including with regard to the review and approval of license applications. Consistent with its commitments in the Phase One Agreement, China announced that it would allow wholly foreign-owned companies for the securities and asset (i.e., fund) management sectors as of April 1, 2020, and that it would allow wholly foreign-owned companies for the futures sector as of January 1, 2020. Prior to these announcements, China had maintained a foreign equity cap of 51 percent for these sectors. Over the past five years, some U.S. financial institutions have applied for and received licenses to operate as wholly foreign-owned enterprises in these sectors. The United States is monitoring these and other developments as U.S. companies continue to seek to obtain licenses and undertake operations in these sectors. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-74-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 67 Insurance Services In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to accelerate the removal of the foreign equity caps for life, pension, and health insurance so that they are removed no later than April 1, 2020. In addition, it confirmed the removal of the 30-year operating requirement, known as a “seasoning” requirement, which had been applied to foreign insurers seeking to establish operations in China in all insurance sectors. China also committed to remove all other discriminatory regulatory requirements and processes and to expeditiously review and approve license applications. Consistent with China’s commitments in the Phase One Agreement, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) announced that China would allow wholly foreign-owned companies for the life, pension, and health insurance sectors as of January 1, 2020. Prior to this announcement, China had maintained foreign equity caps and only permitted foreign companies to establish as Chinese-foreign joint ventures in these sectors. In December 2020, CBIRC issued a measure that provided further transparency regarding its intention to allow foreign-invested companies to take advantage of this opening. In insurance sectors, the United States continues to encourage China to establish more transparent procedures so as to better enable foreign participation in China’s market, especially in export credit insurance and political risk insurance. Finally, some U.S. insurance companies established in China have encountered difficulties in getting CBIRC, replaced by the National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR) in March 2023, to issue timely approvals of their requests to open up new internal branches to expand their operations. The United States continues to urge NAFR to issue timely approvals when U.S. insurance companies seek to expand their branch networks in China. Electronic Payment Services In a WTO dispute that it launched in 2010, the United States challenged China’s restrictions on foreign companies, including major U.S. credit and debit card processing companies, which had been seeking to supply electronic payment services to banks and other businesses that issue or accept credit and debit cards in China. The United States argued that China had committed in its WTO accession agreement to open up this sector in 2006, and a WTO panel agreed with the United States in a decision issued in 2012. China subsequently agreed to comply with the WTO panel’s rulings in 2013, but China did not allow foreign suppliers to apply for licenses until June 2017, when China’s regulator – PBOC – finalized the establishment of a two-step licensing process in which a supplier must first complete one year of preparatory work before being able to apply for a license. As of January 2020, when the United States and China entered into the Phase One Agreement, no foreign supplier of electronic payment services had been able to secure the license needed to operate in China’s market due largely to delays caused by PBOC. At times, PBOC had refused even to accept applications to begin preparatory work from U.S. suppliers, the first of two required steps in the licensing process. Meanwhile, throughout the years that China actively delayed opening up its market to foreign suppliers, China’s national champion, China Union Pay, has used its exclusive access to domestic currency transactions in the China market, and the revenues that come with it, to support its efforts to build out its electronic payment services network abroad, including in the United States. In other words, China consciously decided to maintain market-distorting practices that benefit its own companies, even in the face of adverse rulings at the WTO. In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to ensure that PBOC operates an improved and timely licensing process for U.S. suppliers of electronic payment services so as to facilitate their access to China’s ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-75-2048.jpg) ![68 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS market. In June 2020, four months after the entry into force of the Phase One Agreement, American Express became the first foreign supplier of electronic payment services to secure a license from PBOC to operate in China’s market. In November 2023, after years of delays, Mastercard was finally able to secure a license to operate in the China market. Meanwhile, PBOC has been delaying action for even longer periods of time on the licensing application submitted by another U.S. supplier, Visa. The United States continues to closely monitor this situation with concern. Internet-Enabled Payment Services PBOC first issued regulations for non-bank suppliers of online payment services in 2010, and it subsequently began processing applications for licensees. Regulations were further strengthened in 2015, with additional provisions aimed at increasing security and traceability of transactions. According to a U.S. industry report, of more than 200 licenses issued as of June 2014, only two had been issued to foreign- invested suppliers, and those two were for very limited services. This report provided clear evidence supporting stakeholder concerns about the difficulties they faced entering China’s market and the slow process foreign firms face in getting licensed. In 2018, PBOC announced that it would allow foreign suppliers, on a nondiscriminatory basis, to supply Internet-enabled payment services. At the same time, as in many other sectors, PBOC requires suppliers to localize their data and facilities in China. In January 2021, PayPal became the first foreign company to obtain full ownership of a payment platform in China, along with a license to supply payment services. The United States will continue to closely monitor developments in this area. Telecommunications Services China’s restrictions on basic telecommunications services, such as an informal ban on new entry, a 49- percent foreign equity cap, a requirement that foreign suppliers can only enter into joint ventures with state- owned enterprises, and exceedingly high capital requirements, have blocked foreign suppliers from accessing China’s basic telecommunications services market. Since China acceded to the WTO more than two decades ago, not a single foreign firm has succeeded in establishing a new joint venture to enter this sector. Restrictions maintained by China on less highly regulated value-added telecommunications services also have created serious barriers to market entry for foreign suppliers seeking to enter this sector. These restrictions include opaque and arbitrary licensing procedures, foreign equity caps, and periodic, unjustified moratoria on the issuance of new licenses. As a result, only a few dozen foreign-invested suppliers have secured licenses to provide value-added telecommunications services, while there are thousands of licensed domestic suppliers. Internet Regulatory Regime China’s Internet regulatory regime is restrictive and non-transparent, affecting a broad range of commercial services activities conducted via the Internet, and is overseen by multiple agencies without clear lines of jurisdiction. China’s Internet economy has boomed over the past decade and is second in size only to that of the United States. Growth in China has been marked in service sectors similar to those found in the United States, including retail websites, search engines, vocational and adult online education, travel, advertising, audio-visual and computer gaming services, electronic mail and text, online job searches, Internet consulting, mapping services, applications, web domain registration, and electronic trading. However, in the China market, Chinese companies dominate due in large part to restrictions imposed on foreign companies by the Chinese Government. At the same time, foreign companies continue to encounter major difficulties in attempting to offer these and other Internet-based services on a cross-border basis. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-76-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 69 China continues to engage in extensive blocking of legitimate websites, imposing significant costs on both suppliers and users of web-based services and products. China currently blocks most of the largest global sites, and U.S. industry research has calculated that more than 10,000 sites are blocked, affecting billions of dollars in business, including communications, networking, application stores, news, and other sites. Even when sites are not permanently blocked, the often arbitrary implementation of blocking, and the performance-degrading effect of filtering all traffic into and outside of China, significantly impair the supply of many cross-border services, often to the point of making them unviable. Voice over Internet Protocol Services While computer-to-computer Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) services are permitted in China, China’s regulatory authorities have restricted the ability to offer VOIP services interconnected to the public switched telecommunications network (i.e., to call a traditional phone number) to basic telecommunications service licensees. There is no obvious rationale for such a restriction, which deprives consumers of a useful communication option, and the United States continues to advocate for eliminating it. Cloud Computing Services Especially troubling is China’s treatment of foreign companies seeking to participate in the development of cloud computing services, including computer data processing and storage services and software application services provided over the Internet. China prohibits foreign companies established in China from directly providing any of these services. Given the difficulty in providing these services on a cross- border basis (largely due to restrictive Chinese policies), the only option that a foreign company has to access the China market is to establish a contractual partnership with a Chinese company, which is the holder of the necessary Internet data center license, and turn over its valuable technology, IP, know-how, and branding as part of this arrangement. While the foreign service supplier earns a licensing fee from the arrangement, it has no direct relationship with customers in China and no ability to independently develop its business. It has essentially handed over its business to a Chinese company that may well become a global competitor. This treatment has generated serious concerns in the United States and among other WTO Members as well as U.S. and other foreign companies. In major markets, including China, cloud computing services are typically offered through commercial presence in one of two ways. They are offered as an integrated service in which the owner and operator of a telecommunication network also offers computing services, including data storage and processing function, over that network, or they are offered as a stand-alone computer service, with connectivity to the computing service site provided separately by a telecommunications service supplier. Although China’s commitments under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) include services relevant to both of these approaches, neither one is currently open to foreign-invested companies in China. In October 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) launched a pilot program in four free trade zones, including in Beijing and Shanghai, that is to allow foreign companies to wholly own and operate Internet data centers and content delivery networks. It is not clear whether or even how this program could result in any commercially meaningful market access openings. The United States will closely monitor developments in this area. Audiovisual and Related Services China prohibits foreign companies from providing film production and distribution services in China. In addition, China’s restrictions in the area of theater services have wholly discouraged investment by foreign companies in cinemas in China. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-77-2048.jpg) ![70 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Meanwhile, China’s restrictions on services associated with television and radio greatly limit participation by foreign suppliers. For example, China prohibits retransmission of foreign TV channels, foreign investment in TV production, and foreign investment in TV stations and channels. China also imposes quotas on the amount of foreign programming that can be shown on a Chinese TV channel each day. In addition, in September 2018, the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) issued a problematic draft measure that would impose new restrictions in China’s already highly restricted market for foreign creative content. It would require that spending on foreign content account for no more than 30 percent of available total programs in each of several categories, including foreign movies, TV shows, cartoons, documentaries, and other foreign TV programs, made available for display via broadcasting institutions and online audio-visual content platforms. It also would prohibit foreign TV shows in prime time. Although this measure has not yet been issued in final form, it continues to raise serious concerns, as it appears that, as a matter of practice, it has been implemented in China since 2021, including by online audio-visual content platforms. Theatrical Films In February 2012, the United States and China reached an alternative resolution with regard to certain rulings relating to the importation and distribution of theatrical films in a WTO dispute that the United States had won. The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) providing for substantial increases in the number of foreign films imported and distributed in China each year, along with substantial additional revenue for U.S. film producers. However, China has not yet fully implemented its MOU commitments, including with regard to critical commitments to open up film distribution opportunities for imported films. As a result, the United States has been pressing China for full implementation of the MOU. In 2017, in accordance with the terms of the MOU, the two sides began discussions regarding the provision of further meaningful compensation to the United States in an updated MOU. These discussions continued until March 2018, before stalling when China embarked on a major government reorganization that involved significant changes for China’s Film Bureau. Discussions resumed in 2019 as part of the broader U.S.-China trade negotiations that began following a meeting between the two countries’ Presidents on the margins of the Group of 20 Heads of State and Government Summit in Buenos Aires in December 2018. As of December 31, 2024, no agreement had been reached on the further meaningful compensation that China owes to the United States. The United States will continue pressing China to fulfill its obligations. Online Video and Entertainment Services China restricts the online supply of foreign video and entertainment services through measures affecting both content and distribution platforms, as part of its authoritarian governance structure. China requires foreign companies to license their content to Chinese companies and also imposes burdensome restrictions on content, which are implemented through exhaustive content review requirements that are based on vague and otherwise non-transparent criteria. With respect to distribution platforms, NRTA has required Chinese online platform suppliers to spend no more than 30 percent of their acquisition budget on foreign content. NRTA has also instituted numerous measures that prevent foreign suppliers from qualifying for a license, such as requirements that video platforms all be Chinese-owned.

In addition, beginning with the version of China’s Foreign Investment Negative List that entered into force in July 2020, China has added an explicit prohibition on the ability of a foreign lawyer to become a partner in a domestic law firm. Reportedly, China is also considering draft regulatory measures that would even further restrict the ability of foreign law firms to operate in China. Express Delivery Services The United States continues to have concerns regarding China’s implementation of the 2009 Postal Law and related regulations through which China prevents foreign suppliers of express delivery services from participating fully in the document delivery market. Meanwhile, in the package market, China applies overly burdensome and inconsistent regulatory approaches and reportedly has provided more favorable treatment to Chinese service suppliers when awarding business permits. China also does not always allow foreign service suppliers to participate on an equal basis in the development of laws, regulations, and other measures, including standards, for the express delivery services sector, nor does China always publicly announce the requirements for obtaining a business license. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Data Restrictions In 2024, China, continued to build out its expansive state control over the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of data outside of China, which is of particular concern given China’s already widespread surveillance of people and industry. China’s data regime is governed by a series of overarching laws such as China’s Data Security Law, which entered into force in September 2021, and China’s Personal Information Protection Law, which entered into force in November 2021. These laws operate together with the 2017 Cybersecurity Law, the 2015 National Security Law, and various implementing measures, including the 2022 Security Assessment Measures for Outbound Transfers of Data, to prohibit or severely restrict cross-border transfers of “important data.” China has yet to provide a consistent and widely applicable definition of key terms like “important data” across industry sectors and Free Trade Zones (FTZs). The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has deferred instead to sub-central and sectoral regulators to develop their own definitions. The CAC has also enabled FTZs to develop their own lists of “important data.” This approach has led to conflicting definitions of the term “important data” throughout China, creating confusion for foreign companies. These laws and implementing measures also impose local data storage and processing requirements on companies operating in China that collect “important data” and, in certain cases, personal information. Among other things, China’s data localization requirements put data at risk of access by the Chinese Government, given the Chinese Government’s broad legal authority to compel companies to provide it with access to their data. In March 2024, China’s Provisions to Promote and Regulate the Cross-Border Flow of Data took effect. This measure addresses certain aspects of the Security Assessment Measures for Outbound Transfers of Data with more specificity, but significant U.S. concerns remain, including with regard to the issue of cross- border transfers of “important data.” Recently, China has initiated several pilot projects in its FTZs relating to cross-border transfers of data, although it is not yet clear whether any meaningful changes will result. Cross-border transfers of data are routine and fundamental to daily business operations across many sectors. Given the wide range of businesses and business activities that are dependent on cross-border transfers of data and flexible access to global computing facilities, China’s restrictive measures continue to generate serious concerns in the United States and many other countries. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-79-2048.jpg) ![72 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Secure and Controllable Information and Communication Technology Policies Implementing measures for China’s Cybersecurity Law remain a continued source of serious concern since the law’s enactment in 2016. These measures are overly broad and serve to promote China’s domestic industry at the expense of the industries of China’s trading partners. Of particular concern are the Measures for Cybersecurity Review, first issued in 2016 and later updated in 2020 and again in 2021. This measure puts in place a review process to regulate the purchase of information and communications technology (ICT) products and services by critical information infrastructure operators and online platform operators in China. In addition, in September 2022, China published a draft revision of the Cybersecurity Law with a 15-day public comment period. The draft revision would introduce penalties on operators of critical information infrastructure who use products or services that have not undergone the required security review, and it would also raise fines for certain violations of the Cybersecurity Law. As demonstrated in implementing measures for the Cybersecurity Law, China’s approach is to impose severe restrictions on a wide range of U.S. and other foreign ICT products and services with an apparent goal of supporting China’s technology localization policies by encouraging the replacement of foreign ICT products and services with domestic ones. U.S. and other foreign stakeholders and governments around the world have expressed serious concerns about requirements that ICT equipment and other ICT products and services in critical sectors be “secure and controllable,” as these requirements are used by the Chinese Government to disadvantage foreign companies. In addition to the Cybersecurity Law, China has referenced its “secure and controllable” requirements in a variety of measures dating back to 2013. Through these measures, China has mandated that Chinese information technology users purchase Chinese products and favor Chinese service suppliers, imposed domestic research and development (R&D) requirements, considered the location of R&D as a cybersecurity risk factor, and required the transfer or disclosure of source code or other IP. In the 2019 update of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review, China added political, diplomatic, and other “non- market” developments as potential risk factors to be considered. In 2015, China enacted a National Security Law and a Counterterrorism Law, which include provisions citing not only national security and counterterrorism objectives but also economic and industrial policies. The State Council also published a plan in 2015 that sets a timetable for adopting “secure and controllable” products and services in critical government ministries by 2020. Meanwhile, sector-specific policies under this broad framework continue to be proposed and deployed across China’s economy. A high-profile example from December 2014 was a proposed measure drafted by the China Banking Regulatory Commission that called for 75 percent of ICT products used in the banking system to be “secure and controllable” by 2019 and that would have imposed a series of criteria that would shut out foreign ICT providers from China’s banking sector. Not long afterwards, a similar measure was proposed for the insurance sector. In 2015, the United States, in concert with other governments and stakeholders around the world, raised serious concerns about China’s “secure and controllable” regime at the highest levels of government within China. During a state visit in September 2015 in Washington, D.C., the U.S. and Chinese Presidents committed to a set of principles for trade in information technologies. The issue also was raised in connection with the June 2015 S&ED meeting and the November 2015 JCCT meeting, with China making a series of additional important commitments with regard to technology policy. China reiterated many of these commitments at the November 2016 JCCT meeting, where it affirmed that its “secure and controllable” policies are not to unnecessarily limit or prevent commercial sales opportunities for foreign ICT suppliers or unnecessarily impose nationality-based conditions and restrictions on commercial ICT ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-80-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 73 purchases, sales or uses. China also agreed that it would notify relevant technical regulations to the WTO TBT Committee. Again, however, China has not honored its promises. The numerous draft and final implementation measures issued by China since 2017 in the area of cybersecurity raise serious questions about China’s approach to cybersecurity regulation. China’s measures do not appear to be in line with China’s prior commitments, and global stakeholders have grown even more concerned about the implications of China’s ICT security measures across the many economic sectors that employ digital technologies. Finally, the United States and U.S. stakeholders remain concerned about a nonpublic document authored by the State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in 2022. Known as Document 79, this document reportedly sets out timelines for using only secure and controllable ICT products in the ICT systems of the Chinese Government, the CCP, and state-owned enterprises. The nonpublic nature of Document 79 and China’s lack of transparency with regard to a policy that affects a broad range of industries signal that China may be seeking to evade past commitments to the maintenance of a non-discriminatory, non-trade restrictive approach to cybersecurity regulation. Encryption Use of ICT products and services is increasingly dependent on robust encryption, an essential functionality for protecting privacy and safeguarding sensitive commercial information. Onerous requirements on the use of encryption, including intrusive approval processes and, in many cases, mandatory use of indigenous encryption algorithms (e.g., for Wi-Fi and 4G cellular products), continue to be cited by stakeholders as a significant trade barrier in China. In October 2019, China adopted a Cryptography Law that includes restrictive requirements for commercial encryption products that “involve national security, the national economy and people’s lives, and public interest,” which must undergo a security assessment. This broad definition of commercial encryption products that must undergo a security assessment raises concerns that the new Cryptography Law will lead to unnecessary restrictions on foreign ICT products and services. In August 2020, the State Cryptography Administration issued the draft Commercial Cryptography Administrative Regulations to implement the Cryptography Law. This draft measure did not address the concerns that the United States and numerous other stakeholders had raised regarding the Cryptography Law. Going forward, the United States will continue to monitor implementation of the Cryptography Law and related measures. The United States will remain vigilant toward the introduction of any new requirements hindering technologically neutral use of robust, standardized encryption. INVESTMENT BARRIERS China seeks to protect many domestic industries through a restrictive investment regime. Many aspects of China’s current investment regime continue to cause serious concerns for foreign investors. For example, China’s Foreign Investment Law and implementing regulations, both of which entered into force in January 2020, perpetuate separate regimes for domestic investors and investments and foreign investors and investments. There has also been a lack of substantial liberalization of China’s investment regime, evidenced by the continued application of prohibitions, foreign equity caps and joint venture requirements, and other restrictions in certain sectors. China’s most recent version of its Foreign Investment Negative List, which replaces the 2022 version and entered into force in November 2024, provides no meaningful reductions in ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-81-2048.jpg) ![74 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS the significant investment restrictions that continue to apply in a number of areas important to foreign investors, such as key services sectors, certain types of agriculture and several extractive industries. With regard to services sectors, China maintains prohibitions or restrictions in key sectors such as cloud computing services and other Internet-related services, telecommunications services, film production and film distribution services, and video and entertainment software services. With regard to agriculture, China maintains prohibitions on the development of agricultural biotechnologies and restrictions on the development of new varieties of corn and wheat. Similarly, China maintains prohibitions on the exploration, mining, and processing of all of the 17 types of rare earths as well as tungsten. China’s Foreign Investment Law, implementing regulations, and other related measures suggest that China is pursuing the objective of replacing its case-by-case administrative approval system for a broad range of investments with a system that would only be applied to “restricted” sectors. However, it currently remains unclear whether China is fully achieving that objective in practice. Moreover, even for sectors that have been liberalized, the potential for heightened licensing requirements for foreign companies or the application of licensing processes that disadvantage foreign companies could make it difficult to achieve meaningful market access. In addition, the potential for a new and overly broad national security review mechanism, and the increasingly adverse impact of China’s Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law and related implementing measures, have serious negative implications for foreign investors and investments. Foreign companies also continue to report that Chinese Government officials may condition investment approval on a requirement that a foreign company transfer technology, conduct R&D in China, satisfy performance requirements relating to exportation or the use of local content or make valuable, deal-specific commercial concessions. Over the years, the United States has repeatedly raised concerns with China about its restrictive investment regime. Given that China’s investment restrictions place pressure on U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese companies, they were a focus of USTR’s Section 301 investigation. The responsive actions taken by the United States in that investigation are intended in part to address this concern. In the past several years, the investment climate has turned unusually challenging, in large part because of actions taken by the Chinese Government. For example, purportedly in implementing amendments to China’s Counterespionage Law that broaden the definition of espionage, Chinese security officials recently raided and detained staff at several multinational companies operating in China that help investors perform due diligence regarding existing or potential new investments in China. With no effective judicial recourse or other means for challenging these actions, investors have reported that their confidence in China has been severely damaged. In August 2023, China’s State Council released a new measure, titled Further Optimizing the Foreign Investment Environment and Enhancing the Attraction of Foreign Investment, in the apparent hope of attracting increased levels of foreign investment. Known as Document No. 11, this measure sets forth general guidance to central level ministries and sub-central government authorities on 24 topics related to foreign investment. China has issued similar guidance in the past without meaningfully following through. SUBSIDIES Industrial Subsidies China continues to provide massive subsidies to its domestic industries, which have caused injury to U.S. industries and the industries of other WTO Members. Some of these subsidies also appear to be prohibited under WTO rules. Over the years, to the extent possible, the United States has sought to address these ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-82-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 75 subsidies through countervailing duty proceedings conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and dispute settlement cases at the WTO. The United States and other WTO Members also have continued to press China to notify all of its subsidies to the WTO in accordance with its WTO obligations, while also submitting counter notifications listing hundreds of subsidy programs that China has failed to notify. Over the years, China’s required WTO subsidy notifications have marginally improved at times in terms of timeliness and completeness but not consistently. Nevertheless, since joining the WTO more than 20 years ago, China has not yet submitted to the WTO a complete notification of subsidies maintained by the central government, and it did not notify a single sub-central government subsidy until July 2016, when it provided information largely only on sub- central government subsidies that the United States had challenged as prohibited subsidies in a WTO dispute. While China has notified a small number of sub-central government subsidies in its more recent subsidy notifications, these notifications are woefully inadequate and do not address the most distortionary sub-central government subsidies, such as the increasingly prolific, and very large, “government guidance funds” that can be found at all levels of government in China. Separately, the United States has continued to pursue a series of proposals to reform the functioning of the WTO Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. These proposals have focused on ensuring that Members timely provide written responses to written questions regarding their subsidy programs. Agricultural Domestic Support For several years, China has been significantly increasing the value of domestic subsidies and other support measures for its agricultural sector. China maintains direct payment programs, minimum support prices for basic commodities, and input subsidies. China has implemented a cotton reserve system, based on minimum purchase prices, and cotton target price programs. In 2016, China established subsidies for starch and ethanol producers to incentivize the purchase of domestic corn, resulting in higher volumes of exports of processed corn products from China in 2017 and 2018. In addition, in 2022, China began encouraging soybean production through various support programs, such as through increased subsidies for crop rotations, awards to counties with high oilseed production, incentives to promote the intercropping of corn and soybeans, and subsidies for “demonstration farming” of soybeans on alkali and salty land. There is also evidence that China subsidizes its livestock industry, including at the provincial and local government levels. For example, in the swine industry, state-owned banks offer large-scale swine operations discounted loans, while provincial and local governments offer preferential land deals and rail and utility consolidation. Meanwhile, in the dairy industry, provincial and local governments offer subsidies for milk and whole milk powder production. China submitted a notification concerning domestic support measures to the WTO in May 2015, but it only provided information up to 2010. In December 2018, China notified domestic support measures for the period 2011-2016. This notification showed that China had exceeded its de minimis level of domestic support for soybeans (in 2012, 2014 and 2015), cotton (from 2011 to 2016), corn (from 2013 to 2016), rapeseed (from 2011 to 2013), and sugar (2012). The situation was likely even worse, as the methodologies used by China to calculate domestic support levels result in underestimates. Moreover, the support programs notified by China seemingly failed to account for support given at the sub-national level by provincial and local governments and, possibly, support administered through state-owned enterprises. In December 2022 and September 2024, China submitted additional notifications concerning domestic support measures for the years 2017 through 2022. These notifications show that China exceeded de minimis support for wheat, rice, and soybeans in 2017, 2018, and 2019. These notifications also show new payments under programs notified as production-limiting for soybeans and rice, which is in addition to previously notified production-limiting support for cotton and corn. China’s most recent notifications seemingly not ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-83-2048.jpg) ![76 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS only fail to address concerns raised with regard to notifications made in previous years, but also give rise to additional concerns with regard to how new support measures are classified. In September 2016, the United States launched a WTO dispute challenging China’s government support for the production of wheat, corn, and rice as being in excess of China’s commitments. Like other WTO Members, China committed to limit its support for producers of agricultural commodities. China’s market price support programs for wheat, corn, and rice appear to provide support far exceeding the agreed levels. This excessive support creates price distortions and skews the playing field against U.S. farmers. The WTO panel hearing the case issued its decision in February 2019, ruling that China’s domestic support for wheat and rice was WTO-inconsistent. In July 2020, the United States submitted a request for authorization to suspend concessions and other obligations pursuant to Article 22 of the DSU on the ground that China had failed to bring its measures into compliance with its WTO obligations. After China objected to this request, the matter was referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 22 of the DSU. The arbitration is currently suspended, and the United States continues to closely monitor the operation of China’s market price support programs for wheat and rice. Fisheries Subsidies It is estimated that China is the world’s largest provider of harmful fisheries subsidies, with support exceeding $4.2 billion annually. These subsidies contribute to overfishing and overcapacity that threatens global fish stocks. Indeed, China is the world’s largest producer of marine capture fisheries and, in the years since its WTO accession, has continued to support its fishing fleet through subsidies and other market- distorting means. China’s annual fisheries harvest is nearly double that of the next largest producer in the world in terms of marine capture and triple that of other top producers, like the United States, India, and Indonesia. At the same time, reports continue to emerge about Chinese-flagged fishing vessels engaging in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in distant waters, including in areas under the jurisdiction of other WTO Members. While China has made some progress in reducing subsidies to domestic fisheries, it continues to shift its overcapacity to international fisheries by providing a much higher rate of subsidy support to Chinese distant water fishery enterprises. For several years, the United States has been raising its long-standing concerns over China’s fisheries subsidies programs. In 2015, the United States submitted a written request for information pursuant to Article 25.8 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies Agreement). This submission addressed fisheries subsidies provided by China at central and sub-central levels of government. The subsidies at issue were set forth in nearly 40 measures and included a wide range of subsidies, including fishing vessel acquisition and renovation grants, grants for new fishing equipment, subsidies for insurance, subsidized loans for processing facilities, fuel subsidies, and the preferential provision of water, electricity, and land. When China did not respond to this request, the United States submitted an Article 25.10 counter notification covering these same measures. More recent subsidy notifications by China have been more fulsome, but still incomplete. Going forward, the United States will continue to investigate the full extent of China’s fisheries subsidies and will continue to press China to fully comply with its relevant WTO subsidy obligations. The United States also will urge WTO Members to support additional, ambitious disciplines on harmful fisheries subsidies as part of the further WTO negotiations on fisheries subsidies. Excess Capacity Because China employs a state-led approach to the economy and its economy is the second largest in the world, China is the world’s leading offender in creating non-market excess capacity. For years, China has been responsible for maintaining severe and persistent excess capacity in several industries, including steel, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-84-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 77 aluminum, solar, and shipbuilding. China is also creating severe excess capacity in other industries, such as electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries, among others, through its pursuit of industrial plans such as Made in China 2025, pursuant to which the Chinese Government is providing hundreds of billions of dollars to support Chinese companies and requiring them to achieve preset targets for domestic market share – at the expense of imports – and global market share in each of 10 advanced manufacturing industries. In manufacturing industries such as steel, aluminum, and shipbuilding, China’s economic planners have contributed to massive excess capacity in China through various government support measures, often in furtherance of China’s industrial targeting. For steel, the resulting over-production has distorted global markets, harming U.S. workers and manufacturers in both the U.S. market and third country markets, where U.S. exports of steel and steel-intensive products compete with exports from China. This over-production has similarly harmed the workers and manufacturers of many of the United States’ allies and partners. While China has publicly acknowledged excess capacity in its steel and aluminum industries, it has yet to take meaningful steps to address the root causes of this problem in a sustainable way. Indeed, China continues to replicate these results in other industries. From 2000 to 2023, China accounted for 73 percent of global steelmaking capacity growth, an increase well in excess of the increase in global and Chinese demand over the same period. Currently, China’s capacity represents about one-half of global capacity and more than twice the combined steelmaking capacity of the EU, Japan, the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. At the same time, China’s steel production is continually reaching new highs, eclipsing demand. In 2020, China’s steel production climbed above one billion metric tons for the first time, reaching 1,065 million metric tons, a seven percent increase from 2019, and remained high at 1,019 million metric tons in 2023, despite a significant contraction in domestic steel demand. This sustained ballooning of steel production, combined with weakening economic growth and a slowdown in the Chinese construction sector, has flooded the global market with excess steel and steel-intensive products at a time when steel and other manufacturing sectors outside of China are facing renewed weakness in market conditions, growing global excess capacity, a slowdown in world economic growth, and continued disruptions in supply chains. In 2023, China exported more steel than the world’s second, third, fourth, and fifth largest steel producers (India, Japan, the United States, and Russia) combined. Furthermore, China’s exports from January through August 2024 were 19 percent higher than during the same period in 2023. Today, China remains by far the world’s largest exporter of steel and steel-intensive products. China’s steel production also remains far dirtier in terms of greenhouse gas emissions than the steel production that it displaces in the United States and most other countries. Excess capacity in China’s steel sector boosts the price competitiveness of China’s downstream manufacturing industries in global markets through the provision of artificially low-priced steel inputs. For example, in the shipbuilding sector, steel constitutes a significant percentage of a vessel’s cost. However, reports indicate that Chinese steel is substantially cheaper than in market-oriented economies. For example, the OECD has noted that “Chinese steel prices are significantly lower than Japanese and European ones…in some periods up to 50% compared to…European prices and 60% lower than Japanese prices.” In its 2023 Results Report, the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, a multilateral body facilitated by the OECD, found that “excess capacity in the Chinese steel industry is depressing domestic prices for crude steel products and encouraging production and indirect exports of steel-containing goods.” In addition, according to the 2023 Results Report, “a situation where steel excess capacity starts to build in downstream sectors of the steel market . . . and artificially boost[s] the price competitiveness of those sectors is an additional cause of concern.” Similarly, a study by the OECD reveals that China’s exports of indirect steel products have increased steadily in the last decade while exports of similar products in major steel-making economies such as India, Japan, and the EU have remained stable or, in the case of the United States and ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-85-2048.jpg) ![78 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS South Korea, declined. A rapid increase in Chinese exports of these products in 2017 coincided with a significant buildup of Chinese capacity and reduction in Chinese direct steel exports, leading the OECD to conclude that a substitution effect along the Chinese steel value chain may have taken place. Chinese exports of steel-intensive products continued to increase significantly in volume terms over the last five years. State-directed mergers and acquisitions in the Chinese steel sector have been framed by China as a means for increasing efficiency and reducing excess capacity, but instead these measures have contributed to excess capacity. In 2009, the State Council issued the Steel Industry Adjustment and Revitalization Plan, which set a target of creating five large steel groups controlling 45 percent or more of total national production capacity, with at least 40 percent of production capacity concentrated along rivers and in coastal regions. This industrial plan and other industrial policy measures, including the 14th Five-Year Plan for Development of Raw Materials Industries (2021), the Guiding Opinion Regarding Promoting High Quality Development in the Steel Industry (2022), and the Work Plan for Stable Growth in the Steel Industry (2023), also refer to “capacity replacement policy support” for steel producers engaging in mergers and reorganizations. This policy support effectively exempted these enterprises from otherwise stated prohibitions on new projects without elimination of an equal or greater amount of existing capacity. Despite an acknowledgement by the State Council of the significant growth in “surplus production capacity” in China’s steel sector as far back as 2009, China’s crude steelmaking capacity continued to increase, rising from 980 million metric tons in 2009 to 1.142 billion metric tons in 2023. During this period, China’s state-owned steel producers increased production and market shares, both in the China market and in global markets. In addition, between 2009 and 2023, the shares of domestic crude steel production and global crude steel production attributable to the top four state-owned steel producers in China alone increased from 14.1 percent to 25.8 percent and from 6.5 percent to 13.9 percent, respectively. Similarly, primary aluminum production capacity in China increased by more than 1,600 percent between 2000 and 2023, with China accounting for 80 percent of global capacity growth during that period. China’s expansion of production capacity has driven price declines globally, but even with these low prices, China has continued to expand its production capacity. Much of this additional capacity has been built with government support and relies on GHG emissions-intensive sources of electricity. China’s primary aluminum capacity accounts for 57 percent of global capacity and is more than double the capacity of the next eight aluminum-producing countries combined. As in the steel sector, China’s aluminum production has also ballooned in recent years, as China’s aluminum production has continued to increase despite domestic and global demand shocks. China’s capacity and production continue to contribute to major imbalances and price distortions in global markets, harming U.S. and allied aluminum producers and workers. In China’s shipbuilding sector, non-market policies and practices have led to a significant build up in excess capacity, undercutting foreign competition and consolidating China’s dominant position globally. In a 2021 report, the OECD found that entry subsidies provided by the Chinese Government attracted inefficient enterprises and led to market fragmentation and excess capacity in the shipbuilding sector, while the introduction of production and investment subsidies in combination with sub-optimal exit strategies for inefficient enterprises exacerbated these outcomes. As a result, Chinese shipbuilders increased their share of all merchant tonnage produced globally from 5 percent in 1999 to over 50 percent in 2023, increasing China’s ownership of the global commercial fleet to 19 percent, while securing control of 95 percent of shipping containers and 86 percent of the world’s supply of intermodal chassis, among other components and products. Excess capacity in China hurts various U.S. industries and workers not only through direct exports from China to the United States, but also through its impact on global prices and supply and through indirect ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-86-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 79 trade of steel and aluminum-intensive products, which makes it difficult for competitive manufacturers throughout the world to remain viable. Indeed, domestic industries in many of China’s trading partners continue to petition their respective governments to impose trade measures to respond to the trade-distortive effects of China’s excess capacity. In addition, the United States has acted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose additional duties on steel, aluminum, and derivative steel and aluminum products after finding that these products are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair U.S. national security. In the United States’ view, in the absence of efforts to redress China’s anticompetitive behavior, the risk is that steel and aluminum producers in the United States and many other countries with market-oriented economies will be forced to close, which would, among other things, create even greater dependencies on China. Over the past year, the world has been reminded that the non-market policies and practices that emanate from China’s state-led industrial plans often generate severe and persistent excess capacity, sometimes even when China is not targeting a particular industry for domestic and global dominance. At present, the world is seeing excess capacity emerge in more and more Chinese industries in a dynamic that economists are labeling “China Shock 2.0.” Faced with an acute crisis in the real estate sector and struggling manufacturers coming out of the COVID pandemic, governments at all levels in China have increased their financial and regulatory support for manufacturers in traditional industries like steel, aluminum, household appliances, fertilizers, and machine tools, as well as for manufacturers in emerging, high technology industries. These interventions have led to production well in excess of domestic demand in many sectors, and, in some sectors, such as solar, three or four times the level of global demand. In all of these sectors, with domestic demand in China remaining weak, a wide range of low-priced manufactured goods have been flooding export markets. As discussed above, given China’s economic size as the second largest economy in the world and the largest trader among WTO Members, China’s excess capacity has global implications, and those implications are broadly negative for China’s trading partners, as the world is seeing with China Shock 2.0. ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES As previously reported, China’s implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law has generated various concerns. A key concern is the extent to which the Anti-Monopoly Law is applied to state-owned enterprises. While Chinese regulatory authorities have clarified that the Anti-Monopoly Law does apply to state-owned enterprises, they have brought enforcement actions primarily against provincial government- level state-owned enterprises, rather than central government-level state-owned enterprises under the supervision of SASAC. Moreover, the enforcement actions that do take place, along with any corresponding penalties imposed, are not open and transparent to the public. In addition, provisions in the Anti-Monopoly Law protect the lawful operations of state-owned enterprises and government monopolies in industries deemed nationally important. Another key concern relates to how the Anti-Monopoly Law is applied to foreign companies. Many U.S. companies have cited selective enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law against foreign companies seeking to do business in China as a major concern, and they have highlighted in particular the comparatively limited enforcement of this law against state-owned enterprises. Still another concern expressed by U.S. industry relates to how draft implementing rules for the Anti- Monopoly Law define anti-competitive behavior in the development of standards and the licensing and implementation of standards-essential patents. U.S. industry is concerned that Anti-Monopoly Law enforcement will be misused for the purpose of depressing the value of foreign-owned IP in key technologies, including by finding Anti-Monopoly Law violations with regard to the licensing of patents in the absence of actual harm to competition or the competitive process. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-87-2048.jpg) ![80 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS U.S. industry has also expressed serious concern about insufficient predictability, due process, and transparency in Anti-Monopoly Law investigative processes of foreign companies. For example, U.S. industry reports that, through the threat of steep fines and other penalties, China’s regulatory authorities have pressured foreign companies to “cooperate” in the face of unspecified allegations and have discouraged or prevented foreign companies from bringing counsel to meetings. In addition, U.S. companies continue to report that the Chinese regulatory authorities sometimes make “informal” suggestions regarding appropriate company behavior, including how a company is to behave outside China, strongly suggesting that a failure to comply may result in investigations and possible punishment. More recently, high-level policy statements suggest increased Anti-Monopoly Law enforcement where technology owned or controlled by foreign companies allegedly implicates national security concerns or implicates technology being prioritized for indigenous innovation in China. Given the state-led nature of China’s economy, the need for careful scrutiny of anticompetitive government restraints and regulation is high. The Anti-Monopoly Law’s provisions on the abuse of administrative (i.e., government) power are potentially important instruments for reducing the government’s interference in markets and for promoting the establishment and maintenance of increasingly competitive markets in China. The State Council’s adoption of the Opinions on Establishing a Fair Competition Review System in 2016 reflected a widening of oversight by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agencies over undue government restraints on competition and anticompetitive regulation of competition. Increased oversight in this area was also reflected in the amendments to the Anti-Monopoly Law in 2022, which included a new chapter regarding the abuse of administrative monopoly. The SAMR has since issued draft rules regarding the abuse of administrative monopoly, and SAMR has also identified the elimination of administrative monopolies as an enforcement priority. It remains to be seen whether SAMR will have sufficient authority and resources to implement this enforcement priority robustly. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES While many provisions in China’s WTO accession agreement indirectly discipline the activities of state- owned and state-invested enterprises, China also agreed to some specific disciplines. In particular, it agreed that laws, regulations, and other measures relating to the purchase of goods or services for commercial sale by state-owned and state-invested enterprises, or relating to the production of goods or supply of services for commercial sale or for non-governmental purposes by state-owned and state-invested enterprises, would be subject to certain specified WTO rules. China also affirmatively agreed that state-owned and state- invested enterprises would have to make purchases and sales based solely on commercial considerations, such as price, quality, marketability, and availability, and that the Chinese Government would not directly or indirectly influence the commercial decisions of state-owned and state-invested enterprises. In addition, China agreed that enterprises of other WTO Members would have an adequate opportunity to compete for sales to and purchases from state-owned and invested enterprises on non-discriminatory terms and conditions. In subsequent bilateral dialogues with the United States, China made further commitments. In particular, China committed to develop a market environment of fair competition for enterprises of all kinds of ownership and to provide them with non-discriminatory treatment in terms of credit provision, taxation incentives, and regulatory policies. However, instead of adopting measures giving effect to its commitments, China took steps intended to strengthen the role of state-owned and state-invested enterprises in the economy and to protect them against foreign competition. China established the SASAC and adopted the Law on State-owned Assets of Enterprises, in addition to numerous other measures that mandate state ownership and control of many ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-88-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 81 important industrial sectors. The CCP also ensured itself a decisive role in state-owned and state-invested enterprises’ major business decisions, personnel changes, project arrangements, and movement of funds. The fundamental premise of these measures is to enable the Chinese Government and the CCP to intervene in the business strategies, management, and investments of these enterprises in order to ensure that they play a dominant role in the national economy in line with the overall objective of developing China’s “socialist market economy” and China’s plans for industrial domination. Over the past few years, Party leadership in state-owned and state-invested enterprises has been strengthened through practices such as appointing a person as both the chairman of the board and the Party secretary for a state-owned enterprise and requiring the establishment of party committees in state-owned enterprises. In its 2013 Third Plenum Decision, China endorsed a number of far-reaching economic reform pronouncements, which called for making the market “decisive” in allocating resources, reducing Chinese Government intervention in the economy, accelerating China’s opening up to foreign goods and services and improving transparency and the rule of law to allow fair competition in China’s market. It also called for “reforming” China’s state-owned and state-invested enterprises. However, rather than actually embrace the role of the market, China sought to strengthen the role of the state in the economy, including the role of state-owned enterprises in the economy. Statements by China’s President also made clear that China continues to view the role of the state very differently from the United States and other market economies. In October 2016, China’s President called for strengthening the role of the CCP in state-owned enterprises and emphasized that state-owned enterprises should be “important forces” to implement national strategies and enhance national power. More broadly, in February 2019, in an article in a CCP journal, China’s President further called for the strengthening of the Party’s “leadership over the rule of law,” and he vowed that China “must never copy the models or practices of other countries” and “we must never follow the path of Western ‘constitutionalism,’ ‘separation of powers’ or ‘judicial independence.’” With regard to the reform of China’s state-owned enterprises, one example of China’s efforts included an announcement that China would classify these enterprises into commercial, strategic, or public interest categories and require commercial state-owned and state-invested enterprises to garner reasonable returns on capital. However, this plan also allowed for divergence from commercially driven results to meet broadly construed national security interests, including energy and resource interests and cyber and information security interests. In recent years, China has also sought to strengthen the role of its state- owned enterprises in a number of sectors through mergers to create larger, consolidated, and more powerful enterprises, while also increasing the investment of state capital into sectors that the state deems strategic. Similarly, in recent years, China has pursued reforms through efforts to realize “mixed ownership.” These efforts included largely unsuccessful attempts to pressure private companies to invest in, or merge with, state-owned and state-invested enterprises as a way to inject innovative practices into and create new opportunities for inefficient state-owned and state-invested enterprises. Plainly, none of these various reforms have strengthened the role of the market. Rather, they have strengthened the role of state-owned enterprises in the economy while directing increasing amounts of state capital toward certain industries, including those specified in Made in China 2025, in pursuit of China’s industrial domination objectives. Previously, China had also indicated that it would consider adopting the principle of “competitive neutrality” for state-owned enterprises. However, China has continued to pursue policies that further enshrine the dominant role of the state and its industrial plans when it comes to the operation of state-owned and state-invested enterprises. For example, China has adopted rules ensuring that the Chinese Government continues to have full authority over how state-owned and state-invested enterprises use allocations of state capital and over the projects that state-owned enterprises pursue. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-89-2048.jpg) ![82 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Overall, while China’s efforts at times have appeared to signal a high-level determination to accelerate needed economic reforms, those reforms have not materialized. Indeed, the Chinese Government’s role in the economy has only increased. It also seems clear that China’s past policy initiatives were not designed to reduce the presence of state-owned and state-invested enterprises in China’s economy or to force them to compete on the same terms as private commercial operators. Rather, the reform objectives were to strengthen state-owned and state-invested enterprises through consolidation, increased access to state capital, preferential access to goods and services and the use of other non-market policies and practices designed to give these enterprises unfair competitive advantages, both in China and globally. This unfair situation is made worse for foreign companies. Like China’s state-owned and state-invested enterprises, China’s private companies also benefit from a wide array of state intervention and support designed to promote the development of China’s domestic industries in accordance with China’s industrial domination objectives. These interventions and support are deployed in concert with other non-market policies and practices that restrict, take advantage of, discriminate against, or otherwise create disadvantages for foreign companies and their technologies, products, and services. LABOR The Chinese Government represses internationally recognized labor rights and fails to adequately enforce existing prohibitions on forced labor. China has been the subject of international attention for its forced labor practices, especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), where China has arbitrarily detained more than one million Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities. Victims, news media, and think tanks report that factories frequently engage in coercive recruitment, limit workers’ freedom of movement and communication, and subject workers to constant surveillance, retribution for religious beliefs, exclusion from community and social life, and isolation. It is currently estimated that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other Muslim minority groups are being subjected to forced labor in China following detention. Based on the U.S. Government’s independent analysis of these sources, the U.S. Government has taken several actions to address forced labor and other human rights abuses in the XUAR. Over the years, the Customs and Border Protection of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has issued several withhold release orders (WROs) pursuant to Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 based on information that reasonably indicates the use of detainee or prison labor and situations of forced labor in the XUAR. One of them, issued in January 2021, was a region-wide WRO on cotton and tomato products and all downstream goods containing those products. In July 2020, the United States issued a Xinjiang Supply Chain Business Advisory for U.S. businesses whose supply chains run through the XUAR. The United States updated this advisory in July 2021. As updated, the advisory calls urgent attention to U.S. businesses’ supply chain risks and identifies investing and sourcing considerations for businesses and individuals with exposure to entities engaged in forced labor and other human rights abuses linked to the XUAR. The advisory also describes U.S. Government actions taken to counter the use of forced labor in the XUAR and to prohibit the importation of goods produced in whole or in part with forced labor or convict labor. In September 2023, the United States issued an addendum to the updated advisory to further highlight reports on state-sponsored forced labor and human rights abuses in the XUAR as well as to stress the urgency for businesses to undertake appropriate due diligence measures. In December 2021, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) entered into force. Among other things, it established a rebuttable presumption that the importation of goods from the XUAR is prohibited under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. This rebuttable presumption took effect in June 2022. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-90-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 83 The United States also published a UFLPA Enforcement Strategy in June 2022 and subsequently published updates in August 2023 and July 2024. This Enforcement Strategy takes into account input received from private individuals, industry associations, consultancy and risk-management companies, civil society organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, and others who shared their views on potential measures to prevent the importation into the United States of goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor in China. The main components of the Enforcement Strategy include: (1) an assessment of the risk of importing goods made with forced labor in China, (2) the development of the UFLPA Entity List and descriptions of forced-labor schemes, (3) recommendations for efforts, initiatives, and tools to identify and trace the origin of goods, (4) a description of relevant legal authorities and tools to prevent entry of violative goods, (5) a description of resources, (6) the development of importer guidance, and (7) the development of a coordination plan with NGOs and the private sector. The Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force (FLETF) member agencies, including USTR, have been working to compile and update the UFLPA Entity List, a consolidated register of four distinct lists, including: (1) a list of entities in the XUAR that mine, produce, or manufacture wholly or in part any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise with forced labor; (2) a list of entities that work with the government authorities of the XUAR to recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, or receive forced labor or Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz or members of other persecuted groups out of the XUAR; (3) a list of entities that export products mined, produced, or manufactured by entities in lists 1 or 2 above from China into the United States; and (4) a list of facilities and entities, including the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, that source material from the XUAR or from persons working with the government in the XUAR or the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for purposes of the “poverty alleviation” program or the “pairing assistance” program or any other government labor scheme that uses forced labor. As of December 31, 2024, over 100 entities had been added by the U.S. Government to the UFLPA Entity List. There is no evidence that China has taken any steps toward eliminating forced labor practices and human rights abuses in the XUAR. Indeed, China’s initial response was to conduct raids and impose significant restrictions on U.S. and other foreign consulting companies in China that provide due diligence for foreign investors. Subsequently, China began retaliating against multinational companies that have heeded the Xinjiang Business Advisory and complied with the UFLPA Enforcement Strategy, particularly when these companies have announced their plans publicly. For example, China has actively discouraged Chinese consumers from purchasing the products made by several of these companies China even initiated an investigation into one large U.S. apparel company for “violating normal market trading practices” because this company made a public pledge to move its cotton sourcing out of the XUAR. Depending on its outcome, this retaliatory investigation could potentially result in the company being placed on China’s so- called “Unreliable Entity List” and being subjected to penalties. Separately, in June 2022, the President issued the Memorandum on Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing (IUU) and Associated Labor Abuses. This Memorandum notes that, if left unchecked, IUU fishing and associated labor abuses threaten the livelihoods and human rights of fishers around the world and will undermine U.S. economic competitiveness, national security, and fishery sustainability. In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned individuals associated with China’s distant water fishing vessels for serious human rights abuse, including forced labor, of workers aboard these vessels. It also remains concerning that China does not adhere to certain other internationally recognized labor standards, including freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Chinese law provides for the right to associate and form a union, but does not allow workers to form or join an independent union of their own choosing. Unions must affiliate with the official All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), which is under the direction of the CCP. Workers at enterprises in China are ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-91-2048.jpg) ![84 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS required to accept the ACFTU as their representative. They cannot instead select another union or decide not to have any union representation. Only collective bargaining through the ACFTU is permitted, and there is no legal obligation for an employer to bargain in good faith. Striking is also prohibited. ENVIRONMENT Effect of Import Ban on Scrap Materials, Recyclable Materials, and on Recycling Markets Currently, China restricts almost all imports of unprocessed scrap and recyclable materials. China only allows imports of certain processed materials, including “recycled raw materials” such as copper, steel, aluminum and brass that meet purity standards, pelletized scrap plastic, and pulped scrap paper. These restrictions have contributed to increased costs for recycling in the United States and the decisions by some communities to terminate some of their recycling programs. Because China was previously such a large destination market, significant amounts of U.S. scrap materials are being redirected to landfills or incinerators. Since 2017, China has issued numerous measures that limit or ban imports of most scrap and recovered materials, such as certain types of plastic, paper, and metals. China has also employed import licensing and inspection measures to restrict imports of scrap materials. Notably, China does not universally apply similar restrictions to domestic processers of domestically sourced scrap and recovered materials. In 2020, China amended the Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution by Solid Waste. According to this amended law, the intent is to reduce imports of solid waste essentially to zero. U.S. exports to China of the unprocessed scrap and recovered materials covered by China’s restrictive measures totaled $479 million in 2016, the year before China started to pursue its more restrictive policies. Since then, U.S. exports of these materials to China have been significantly reduced. In addition to impacting the global market for scrap and recovered materials, the tightened restrictions have raised the costs of recycling in the United States, as exporters seek domestic processing facilities or international buyers. Additionally, other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, have introduced their own regulatory changes that in some ways parallel the changes in China’s import regime, such as by setting impossibly high purity standards for recyclable materials, imposing new import licensing requirements and requiring pre-shipment and post-shipment inspections. As a result, significant amounts of U.S. scrap materials and recyclable materials have not found new buyers, leading to increased landfilling, incineration, and air pollution and increased demand for virgin materials globally. Import Ban on Remanufactured Products China prohibits the importation of remanufactured products, which it typically classifies as used goods. China also maintains restrictions that prevent remanufacturing process inputs (known as cores) from being imported into China’s customs territory, except special economic zones. These import prohibitions and restrictions undermine the development of industries in many sectors in China, including mining, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, and communications, because companies in these industries are unable to purchase high-quality, lower-cost remanufactured products produced outside of China. Nevertheless, China is apparently prepared to pay this price in order to limit imports of remanufactured goods. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-92-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 85 OTHER BARRIERS Export Restraints Over the years, China has deployed a combination of export restraints, including export quotas, export licensing, minimum export prices, export duties, and other restrictions, on a number of raw material inputs where it holds the leverage of being among the world’s leading producers. In many instances, through these export restraints, it appears that China has been able to provide substantial economic advantages to a wide range of downstream producers in China at the expense of foreign downstream producers, while creating pressure on foreign downstream producers to move their operations, technologies, and jobs to China. In 2013, China removed its export quotas and duties on several raw material inputs of key interest to the U.S. steel, aluminum, and chemicals industries after the United States won a dispute against China at the WTO. In 2014, the United States won a second WTO dispute, focusing on China’s export restraints on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum, which are key inputs for a multitude of U.S.-made products, including hybrid automobile batteries, wind turbines, energy-efficient lighting, steel, advanced electronics, automobiles, petroleum, and chemicals. China removed those export restraints in 2015. In 2016, the United States launched a third WTO dispute challenging export restraints maintained by China. The challenged export restraints include export quotas and export duties maintained by China on various forms of 11 raw materials, including antimony, chromium, cobalt, copper, graphite, indium, lead, magnesia, talc, tantalum, and tin. These raw materials are key inputs in important U.S. manufacturing industries, including aerospace, automotive, construction, and electronics. While China appears to have removed the challenged export restraints, the United States has continued to monitor the situation and finds it deeply concerning that the United States needed to bring multiple disputes to address the same WTO compliance issues. A newer concern involves China’s expanding regulation of rare earths. Since November 2023, China has been requiring exporters to provide detailed reporting on transactions involving rare earths. In addition, in June 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued the Regulations on the Administration of Rare Earths, which covers the mining, refining and separation, metal smelting, and usage of rare earths. The regulations mandate a detailed “tracing” system to track the mining, production, refining, transfer, and end-use of rare earths. Foreshadowing possible future regulation of rare earths under China’s export control regime, this measure also provides that rare earth exporters need to abide by laws and regulations in the area of export controls. Over the last two years, China has been ramping up its use of export controls and various designation lists to target the supply chains of the United States and its allies, as China has weaponized its export controls, primarily targeting the U.S. defense industrial base and critical minerals that have wide-ranging commercial uses. China began applying its export control regime to various critical minerals in 2023 by requiring export licenses for products containing gallium, germanium, and graphite, followed by antimony and products and technologies essential to the production of superhard materials in 2024. China has tied the basis for these export controls to national security and international nonproliferation obligations. However, many of the export controls are broadly scoped and encumber legitimate commercial trade. China’s legal regime also provides for the extraterritorial reach of the export controls, creating potential downstream impact. In addition, under the 2020 Export Control Law, China explicitly authorizes the imposition of export controls as a retaliatory measure against countries determined to be harming China’s national security or interests. In November 2021, China announced an export ban on certain fertilizers. In June 2024, China imposed further export restrictions on fertilizers. Despite repeated requests from its trading partners to lift this export ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-93-2048.jpg) ![86 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS ban and help address growing international concern over rising commodity prices and disrupted global supply chains, China continues to impose this export ban. Finally, since 2002, China has maintained a distinct administrative system for control over technology transfer under the Regulation on the Administration of Technology Import and Export. The technology transfer control regime established by this measure governs the overseas transfer of technologies by trade, investment, or economic or technological cooperation and includes intellectual property, licensing, trade secrets, and technology services of technologies listed in the Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export, which was most recently updated in December 2023. Technologies that are “prohibited” cannot be exported, while “restricted” technologies require a license for export. Unlike the Export Control Law, which aims to safeguard “national security and interests” and to ensure “non- proliferation and other international obligations,” the stated goal of the Regulation on the Administration of Technology Import and Export is “enhancing the national economic growth and scientific development.” The Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export prohibits or restricts the export of an array of technologies in areas such as rare earth extraction and separation, cryptography, and traditional Chinese medicine processing. Value-Added Tax Rebates and Related Policies As in prior years, in 2024, the Chinese Government attempted to manage the export of many primary, intermediate, and downstream products by raising or lowering the VAT rebate available upon export. China sometimes reinforces its objectives by imposing or retracting export duties. These practices have caused tremendous disruption, uncertainty, and unfairness in the global markets for some products, particularly downstream products for which China is a leading world producer or exporter, such as products made by the steel, aluminum, and soda ash industries. These practices, together with other policies, such as excessive government subsidization, have also contributed to severe excess capacity in these same industries. An apparently positive development took place at the July 2014 S&ED meeting, when China committed to improve its VAT rebate system, including by actively studying international best practices, and to deepen communication with the United States on this matter, including regarding its impact on trade. Once more, however, this promise remains unfulfilled. China has not made any movement toward the adoption of international best practices. Trade Remedies As of December 31, 2024, China had 11 ongoing antidumping investigations and 108 antidumping measures in place, affecting imports from 17 countries or regions. China also had one ongoing countervailing duty investigation and four countervailing duty measures in place, affecting imports from two countries or regions. In addition, China had one ongoing safeguard investigation. The most significant systemic shortcomings in China’s antidumping and countervailing duty practice continue to be in the areas of transparency and due process. Over the years, China has often utilized antidumping and countervailing duty investigations as more of a retaliatory tool than as a mechanism to nullify the effects of dumping or unfair subsidization within its domestic market. In response, the United States has pressed China bilaterally, in WTO meetings and through written comments submitted in connection with pending antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings to adhere strictly to WTO rules in the conduct of its trade remedy investigations. The conduct of antidumping investigations by China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) continues to fall short of full commitment to the fundamental tenets of transparency and procedural fairness embodied in the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-94-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 87 1994, commonly known as the Antidumping Agreement. The United States and other WTO Members accordingly have expressed concerns about key lapses in transparency and due process in China’s conduct of antidumping investigations. The principal areas of concern include: MOFCOM’s inadequate disclosure of key documents placed on the record by domestic Chinese producers; insufficient disclosures of the essential facts underlying MOFCOM decisions, such as dumping margin calculations and evidence supporting injury and dumping conclusions; MOFCOM’s failure to issue supplemental questionnaires in instances where MOFCOM identifies information deficiencies; the improper rejection of U.S. respondents’ reported cost and sales data; the unjustified use of facts available; and MOFCOM’s failure to adequately address critical arguments or evidence put forward by interested parties. These aspects of China’s antidumping practice have been raised with MOFCOM in numerous proceedings at the WTO over the past several years. In certain past antidumping investigations of U.S. imports, China has determined – without legal or factual support – that costs and prices in certain U.S. markets are distorted, and therefore unusable, because of so- called “non-market situations.” China is again exploring whether a “non-market situation” exists in certain U.S. energy sectors in its ongoing antidumping investigation of polyoxymethylene copolymer from the United States. A preliminary determination in this investigation is expected in early 2025. A review of China’s conduct of countervailing duty investigations makes clear that, as in the antidumping area, China has failed to adequately improve its transparency and due process when conducting these investigations. In addition, the United States has noted procedural concerns specific to China’s conduct of countervailing duty investigations. For example, in recent years, China has initiated investigations of alleged subsidies that raised concerns, given the requirements regarding “sufficient evidence” in Article 11.2 of the Subsidies Agreement. The United States is also concerned about China’s application of facts available under Article 12.7 of the Subsidies Agreement. On several occasions in the past, the United States has expressed serious concerns about China’s pursuit of antidumping and countervailing duty remedies that appear to be retaliatory and intended to discourage the United States and other trading partners from the legitimate exercise of their rights under WTO antidumping and countervailing duty rules and the trade remedy provisions of China’s accession agreement. It also appears that China has used arbitrary economic and trade measures, including antidumping and countervailing duty investigations, as a form of economic coercion designed to achieve China’s political goals. The antidumping and countervailing duties that China imposed on imports of Australian barley in 2021 and the antidumping duties that China imposed on imports of Australian wine in 2021 are two obvious examples of this tactic, as China used them to express dissatisfaction with political statements and actions taken by the Australian government. More recently, in 2024, China launched antidumping investigations of imports of brandy, pork, and dairy products from the EU as the EU’s anti-subsidy investigation of Chinese electric vehicle imports proceeded. In certain recent investigations of U.S. imports, China has also made determinations without legal or factual support. For example, in the final countervailing duty determination on imports of n-propanol from the United States, China found that alleged subsidies to the U.S. oil and gas sector automatically passed through to petrochemical products without providing the analysis required by the Subsidies Agreement. Pharmaceuticals For several years, the United States has pressed China on a range of pharmaceuticals issues. These issues have related to matters such as overly restrictive patent application examination practices, regulatory approvals that are delayed or linked to extraneous criteria, weak protections against the unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of regulatory data, issues with the implementation of an efficient mechanism to resolve patent infringement disputes, requirements to share ownership with a Chinese partner ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-95-2048.jpg) ![88 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS of patent rights arising from research generated by using human genetic resources in China, and implementation of patent term extensions for unreasonable marketing approval delays, including limits on the type of protection provided. While China has implemented some helpful reforms, the United States still has many of the same concerns with China’s pharmaceutical market, especially as it pertains to treatment of foreign companies. In its WTO accession agreement, China committed to provide effective protection against unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. To provide this protection, known as regulatory data protection (RDP), China committed to enact laws and regulations to ensure that no person, other than the submitter of the data, could rely on the submitted data in a product approval application without permission from the submitter for six years from the date on which China granted marketing approval to the submitter. In 2017, CFDA finally issued several draft notices addressing the issue of RDP. These draft notices set out a conceptual framework to protect against the unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products, and they also sought to promote the efficient resolution of patent disputes between right holders and the producers of generic pharmaceuticals. However, the proposed framework did not provide for a six-year period of RDP despite the commitment that China had made in its WTO accession agreement in 2001. In 2018, CFDA’s successor agency, NMPA, issued draft Drug Registration Regulations and draft implementing measures on drug trial data that would preclude or condition the duration of RDP on whether clinical trials occur in China and whether marketing approval is sought first in China. Subsequently, China issued a revised Drug Administration Law in 2019, followed by NMPA’s revised draft Drug Registration Regulations in 2020 and NMPA’s revised draft Drug Administration Law Implementing Regulations in 2021. Despite the opportunities that these revised draft measures afforded China’s regulatory authorities, the concerning limitations on RDP were not removed, and China still has not created a regulatory framework providing for the six-year period of RDP as it had committed to do in 2001. Since 2018, volume-based procurement has presented a new market access complication for foreign suppliers of pharmaceuticals, largely because of the opaque and unpredictable nature of the bidding processes. In November 2018, a National Drug Centralized Procurement Pilot Scheme was launched. Then, in January 2019, the State Council issued a Pilot Plan for National Centralized Drug Procurement and Use. In January 2023, China’s National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) published the 2022 edition of its annual National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), which became effective in March 2023. U.S. industry also cites the need for increased transparency and greater harmony between national and provincial bidding processes as well as a greater emphasis on a competitive, market-based approach to evaluating a product’s value and relevant bids. In December 2022, NHSA and CNIPA jointly issued the Opinions on Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights in the Field of Centralized Pharmaceutical Procurement, which sets out to establish a coordination mechanism to remove patent- infringing drugs from the NRDL, with further implementing measures to follow. As part of the Phase One Agreement, the two sides agreed that China would establish a nationwide mechanism for the early resolution of potential pharmaceutical patent disputes that covers both small molecule drugs and biologics, including a cause of action to allow a patent holder to seek expeditious remedies before the marketing of an allegedly infringing product. Separately, the agreement also provides for patent term extensions to compensate for unreasonable patent and marketing approval delays that cut into the effective patent term as well as for the use of supplemental data to meet relevant patentability criteria for pharmaceutical patent applications. The United States and China agreed to address data protection for pharmaceuticals in future negotiations. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-96-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 89 In October 2020, China amended the Patent Law to provide for patent term extensions for unreasonable patent and marketing approval delays, and it also added a mechanism for the early resolution of potential patent disputes, known as patent linkage. Implementing measures for the patent linkage mechanism were issued in July 2021, as NMPA and CNIPA jointly issued the Trial Implementation Measures for the Mechanism for Early Resolution of Drug Patent Disputes and the Supreme People’s Court issued the Regulations on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Civil Patent Disputes Related to Drug Registration Application. In 2021 and 2022, CNIPA issued draft implementing rules for the amended Patent Law and drafts of amendments to the Patent Examination Guidelines. In December 2023, China released the final implementing rules for the amended Patent Law. Among other things, the United States and U.S. stakeholders remain concerned about China’s implementation of patent term extensions for unreasonable patent and marketing approval delays, including the limits on the type of protection provided by China’s regulatory framework. The United States and U.S. stakeholders also remain concerned about China’s patent linkage mechanism. Medical Devices For many years, working closely with U.S. industry, the United States has raised concerns about China’s pricing and tendering procedures for medical devices and its treatment of imported medical devices. Notably, at the November 2015 JCCT meeting, China committed that, in terms of accessing the market, it will give imported medical devices the same treatment as medical devices manufactured or developed domestically. Unfortunately, despite this commitment, China continues to pursue a wide range of policies that direct China’s purchasing authorities to prioritize the procurement of domestic medical devices over imported medical devices. In addition, when China allows the procurement of imported medical devices, the applicable regulations often explicitly preference foreign suppliers that agree to transfer their technology to Chinese enterprises. Separately, the United States has pressed China’s regulatory authorities to develop sound payment systems for medical devices that are transparent, predictable, and competitive. The United States has also urged China to adequately recognize quality, safety, and the costs of R&D in its approach to procurement policy. In 2019, China’s State Council launched a volume-based procurement (VBP) approach for medical devices in a few provinces and municipalities in an attempt to cut healthcare costs. Since then, VBP has become further engrained in China’s system, with the formation of multi-province and municipal alliances to conduct joint procurements under VBP. In 2020, China implemented its first national VBP tender, which has been subsequently followed by additional national tenders. However, U.S. industry reports that the vast majority of VBP tendering activities are occurring at the sub-national level and that future VBP tenders are likely to be led by individual or groups of subnational entities. U.S. industry also reports that pricing for subsequent rounds of the same products under VBP tenders will likely be based on the results from past tenders. In practice, China’s VBP approach prioritizes cost over a medical device’s value or quality, inhibiting the ability of high-quality, cutting-edge exports from the United States and other countries to compete with low-cost local alternatives. As the Chinese Government has acknowledged, the price-cutting generated by VBP disproportionately impacts foreign medical device manufacturers, whose only option for securing sales is to offer their products at unsustainably low prices. According to U.S. industry stakeholders, if China continues to pursue VBP without significant changes, it could lead to the creation of a sector in which Chinese medical device companies develop monopolies in the manufacture and sale of various low-cost, low-quality medical devices in the China market. This outcome would operate to the disadvantage of innovative medical device companies, many of which are ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-97-2048.jpg) ![90 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS foreign companies, and the patients who rely on advanced medical technologies. Reportedly, some of these medical device companies are reducing training to healthcare providers in order to offer the necessary price cuts. Overall, given the size of China’s medical device market, China’s VBP approach poses a risk to innovation in the medical device sector and the provision of high-quality medical treatment, not only in the China market but also globally. Meanwhile, the Made in China 2025 industrial plan announced by the State Council in 2015 seeks to prop up China’s domestic medical device sector through a series of support policies, including targeted funds, local content guideless, and procurement policies. The goal of these policies is to significantly increase the market share of domestically owned and domestically manufactured medical devices, and correspondingly decrease market share of foreign medical devices, by 2025. At the same time, some provincial governments directly subsidize the purchase of domestically manufactured medical devices. Some provincial governments have also issued guidelines urging medical institutions to prioritize the procurement of local medical equipment over imported equipment. In at least one province, the guidelines suggest that only imported medical devices for which there is not a domestic replacement will be eligible for procurement. As discussed in more detail in the Government Procurement section above, in December 2024, China’s Ministry of Finance issued for public comment the Notice on Matters Concerning Domestic Product Standards and Implementation Policies in the Field of Government Procurement (Draft for Comments). Currently, the vast majority of medical devices in China are purchased through government procurement. The United States continues to urge China to make any draft implementing measures public and to provide a reasonable period for the public to submit comments. U.S. industry also reports that while sub-central governments in China have always provided some financial support to domestic medical devices companies, their support appears to have increased since 2020. U.S. industry has noted that this trend could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s first-ever five- year medical equipment industrial plan covering the years 2021 to 2025, the Action Plan to Promote the High-Quality Development of the Medical Equipment Industry (2023-2025), or possibly all three factors. The United States will monitor this situation closely and will encourage China to be transparent in its approach. In August 2024, NMPA published a draft Medical Device Management Law. The draft law appears to eliminate certain onerous requirements such as requiring home country approvals before an imported medical device can be registered in China. However, the draft law also promises further industrial policy support for China’s medical device sector, including financial support, which indicates that China’s unfair, anti-competitive approach will likely continue. The United States submitted written comments on the draft law and will continue to monitor development of the law and any subsequent implementing regulations. Finally, in June 2024, MIIT issued new guidance on “first-of-its-kind” major technical equipment, and several provincial and local authorities have subsequently issued measures and related guidance. Collectively, these new actions create incentives for procuring medical devices and other technical equipment for which the underlying IP is owned by an entity in China. The implications of these new measures remain unclear, both for U.S. medical device exports and medical devices produced in China based on IP owned by U.S. entities. The United States is monitoring developments closely. Social Credit System Since 2014, China has been working to implement a national “social credit” system for both individuals and companies. The implementation of this system is at a more advanced stage for companies versus individuals, as 18-digit “unified social credit codes” are assigned to every domestic and foreign company ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-98-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 91 in China. These 18-digit codes will provide a way for the Chinese Government to track a company’s record of administrative and regulatory compliance and generate public credit information. In a report to the 20th National Party Congress in October 2022, the CCP’s General Secretary emphasized the need to refine the social credit system. Since then, the Chinese Government has continued to take steps to make the social credit system fully operational. Under the corporate social credit system, government records, and market-generated corporate compliance data are collected on every legal entity in China. The collected information contains regulatory and administrative records contributed by at least 44 state agencies and their branch offices across every province in China. Previously disparate information relating to a company’s financial records, regulatory compliance, inspection results and other administrative enforcement activities is being consolidated under a company’s unified social credit code. All of this data will be aggregated and shared between regulatory agencies via the National Credit Information Sharing Platform. Reportedly, approximately 75 percent of the records collected on companies is intended to be designated as “open to the public,” while the remaining 25 percent that is intended to be withheld will include potentially sensitive information, such as approval records related to national development projects and details of any criminal cases. Nationwide data collection under the corporate social credit system provides mechanisms to penalize companies with poor corporate and legal compliance records by, among other things, subjecting them to public censure, while rewarding compliant companies with positive incentives. Negative ratings or placement on a government agency’s censure list can lead to various restrictions on a company’s business activities. A company could face increased inspections, reduced access to loans and tax incentives, restrictions on government procurement, reduced land-use rights, monetary fines or permit denials, among other possible penalties. Currently, however, there is no fully integrated national system for assigning comprehensive social credit scores for companies, and the social credit system remains highly fragmented. Certain central government agencies and sub-central government agencies maintain their own rating systems, with each agency making its own decisions about the types of transgressions that warrant negative ratings or placing a company on a censure list. In November 2022, NDRC and PBOC jointly published a draft Social Credit Construction Law that would give the social credit system a legal basis, further embedding it into China’s regulatory network. The draft law seeks to establish NDRC and PBOC as the main government agencies for construction of the social credit system. Their responsibilities would include overall coordination, supervision and guidance of the construction of the social credit system, and taking the lead in organizing the formulation and implementation of relevant policies and standards. The draft law also seeks to provide formal legal definitions for certain terms used in implementing the social credit system, such as “untrustworthy,” “credit supervision,” and “credit information.” In addition, the draft law seeks to codify the protection of certain rights, as it calls for the establishment of a social credit system that maintains the security of social credit information and strictly protects state secrets, business secrets, and personal privacy, while also protecting the lawful rights and interests of natural persons, legal persons, and unincorporated organizations. As of December 31, 2024, the draft law had not been issued in final form. Earlier in 2022, prior to the publication of the draft law, NDRC issued a draft update of the 2021 National Basic Catalogue of Public Credit Information and a draft update of the 2021 National Basic List of Disciplinary Measures against Dishonest Acts. The draft Catalogue of Public Credit Information compiles the scope and types of credit information that can be collected by government agencies. It also stipulates that certain categories of information are exempt from collection, including state secrets and trade secrets. The draft List of Disciplinary Measures includes a range of punitive actions that may be applied to violators of trust, such as duties, fees, restrictions on market activity, prohibitions, or limitations on occupations and ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-99-2048.jpg) ![92 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS bans from government procurement bidding. Like the draft law, neither the draft Catalogue of Public Credit Information nor the draft List of Disciplinary Measures has been issued in formal form. The social credit system has been tied to larger policy objectives as well. For example, the General Office of the State Council and the General Office of the CCP issued a joint opinion on promoting a high-quality credit system in order to further China’s “dual circulation” objectives. In addition, in November 2022, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) announced a new pilot project for evaluating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics talent. Under MOST’s new pilot project, evaluation of scientists’ performance is to incorporate metrics related to their moral character, which includes their social credit record, in order to ensure that scientific researchers have no history of plagiarism or academic fraud. This pilot project appears to reflect China’s struggle to improve the quality of its scientific research talent. Foreign companies also have numerous concerns with China’s social credit system, which is becoming increasingly complex and expansive. They are concerned that the Chinese Government will use it to disadvantage or coerce foreign companies or provide favorable treatment to domestic companies. They are concerned that the Chinese Government will use the social credit system to pressure them to act in furtherance of China’s industrial policies or other state priorities or otherwise to make investments or conduct their business operations in ways that run counter to market principles or their own business strategies. In addition, foreign companies are concerned about the opaque nature of the social credit system. Currently, for example, a company sometimes only learns about its negative ratings when, for example, it requests a permit and receives a denial, even though the Measures for Administration of the List of Serious Violators of Trust and Law includes a requirement that companies be informed of their being censured in advance. Other times, a company learns for the first time that it has been censured when a Chinese Government agency posts its name on the agency’s website, even though the censuring of a company can cause severe harm to the company’s reputation and adversely impact its efforts to attract customers, secure needed financing or make new investments. When Chinese Government agencies begin to pursue joint punishment in the way that NDRC envisions, it will mean that an infraction in one regulatory context could have wider consequences across the company’s entire business operations. Foreign companies are also concerned about the links between corporate social credit and individual social credit. They can foresee the Chinese Government using the social credit system as another tool to coerce foreign companies and those who work for them not to cross political redlines on sensitive matters like deprivation of human rights. Foreign companies can also foresee the Chinese Government potentially using corporate social credit in the future to exert extraterritorial influence by threatening the social credit standing of foreign companies or their officials for behavior or speech outside of China. Similarly, foreign companies are concerned that China will abuse its legion of laws regulating how data is stored and transferred to access information to use against them. Administrative Licensing U.S. companies continue to encounter significant problems with a variety of administrative licensing processes in China, including processes to secure product approvals, investment approvals, business expansion approvals, business license renewals, and even approvals for routine business activities. While there has been an overall reduction in license approval requirements and a focus on decentralizing licensing approval processes, U.S. companies continue to report that one of their key concerns involves China’s problematic licensing approval processes. Among other things, according to U.S. companies, China provides preferential treatment to Chinese companies, including both state-owned and private enterprises, when granting license approvals. In July 2024, the Central Committee of the CCP and the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Promoting the Growth and Development of the Private Economy, sometimes referred to as the “31-Point ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-100-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 93 Plan.” The measure, whose stated objective is to promote the growth and development of the private sector in China, purports to prohibit government agencies from using administrative requirements, such as filing, licensing, and approvals, to create market entry barriers. In theory, foreign companies, as part of the Chinese private economy, should benefit from the measure. However, the measure has not resulted in any concrete improvements for U.S. companies seeking to conduct business in China. Transparency One of the core principles reflected throughout China’s WTO accession agreement is the enhancement of transparency. Unfortunately, after more than 20 years of WTO membership, China still has a poor record when it comes to adherence to its transparency obligations. Publication of Trade-Related Measures In its WTO accession agreement, China committed to adopt a single official journal for the publication of all trade-related laws, regulations, and other measures. In 2006, China adopted such a single official journal, administered by MOFCOM. However, many trade-related measures are never published in this journal. At the central government level, it appears that China only publishes trade-related measures issued by some, but not all, central-government entities in the official journal, as China tends to take a narrow view regarding the types of trade-related measures that are required to be published in the official journal. For those government entities whose trade-related measures are published in the official journal, China more commonly (but still not regularly) publishes trade-related administrative regulations and departmental rules in the journal, but it is rare for China to publish other measures such as opinions, circulars, orders, directives, and notices, which are known as “normative documents” in China’s legal system. Normative documents are regulatory documents that do not fall into the category of administrative regulations or departmental rules, but still impose binding obligations on enterprises and individuals. Although the State Council introduced a definition for “administrative normative documents” in 2014, this definition is narrow and does not appear to encompass all normative documents, nor has it resulted in their regular publication as required by China’s WTO commitments. Among other things, publication of all normative documents would facilitate compliance by enterprises and individuals with the obligations addressed in them. Meanwhile, the situation is even worse for measures issued by sub-central governments in China. China rarely publishes any trade-related measures issued by sub-central governments in the official journal. Finally, China rarely publishes certain types of trade-related measures from either the central level or the sub-central level of government in the official journal. As discussed above in the Industrial Subsidies section, an important example involves subsidy measures. Notice-and-Comment Procedures In its WTO accession agreement, China committed to provide a reasonable time period for public notice and comment before implementing new trade-related laws, regulations, and other measures. While little progress has been made in implementing this commitment at the sub-central government level, the National People’s Congress instituted notice-and-comment procedures for draft laws in 2008, and shortly thereafter China indicated that it would also publish proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations and departmental rules for public comment. Subsequently, the National People’s Congress began regularly publishing draft laws for public comment. China’s State Council often (but not regularly) published draft administrative regulations for public comment, but many of China’s ministries were not consistent in publishing draft departmental rules or normative documents for public comment. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-101-2048.jpg) ![94 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS At the May 2011 S&ED meeting, China committed to issue a measure implementing the requirement to publish all proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations and departmental rules on the website of the State Council’s Legislative Affairs Office (SCLAO) for a public comment period of not less than 30 days. In April 2012, the SCLAO issued two measures that appear to address this requirement. In the Phase One Agreement, China committed to provide no less than 45 days for public comment on all proposed laws, regulations, and other measures implementing the Phase One Agreement. Since the entry into force of this commitment in February 2020, China has generally been providing the required 45-day public comment period and working constructively with the United States whenever it has raised questions or concerns regarding provisions in proposed implementing measures. Currently, outside the context of Phase One Agreement implementing measures, the process for issuing new measures in China can be opaque and unpredictable. China has yet to adequately improve its practices relating to the publication of proposed administrative regulations and departmental rules for public comment. China has also yet to formalize its use of notice-and-comment procedures for proposed normative documents, although some individual ministries have standardized their internal procedures for issuing administrative normative documents. In addition, even when China provides for a notice-and- comment period, too often it issues the final measure immediately after the end of the comment period, suggesting that it did not give serious consideration to the comments received. In addition, China often fails to provide an adequate implementation period once a measure has been finalized. Similarly, China has yet to implement consistently the notice-and-comment obligations applicable to all WTO Members. Most notably, China needs to adhere consistently to the notice-and-comment periods required by the TBT Agreement and the SPS Agreement. Translations In its WTO accession agreement, China committed to make available translations of all of its trade-related laws, regulations, and other measures at all levels of government in one or more of the WTO languages, i.e., English, French, and Spanish. Prior to 2014, China had only compiled translations of trade-related laws and administrative regulations (into English), but not other types of measures, such as departmental rules, normative documents, and sub-central government measures. Even for trade-related laws and administrative regulations, China was years behind in publishing these translations. At the July 2014 S&ED meeting, China committed that it would extend its translation efforts to include not only trade-related laws and administrative regulations but also trade-related departmental rules. Subsequently, in March 2015, China issued a measure requiring trade-related departmental rules to be translated into English. This measure also provides that the translation of a departmental rule normally must be published before implementation. Notably, however, even if China were to fully implement its existing measures requiring translations, they would not be sufficient to bring China into full WTO compliance in this area. China does not consistently publish translations of trade-related laws, administrative regulations, and departmental rules in a timely manner (i.e., before implementation), nor does it publish any translations of trade-related normative documents or trade-related measures issued by sub-central governments. Enquiry Point In its WTO accession agreement, China committed to establish an enquiry point that would respond to requests for information relating to legal measures required to be published in its official journal. At times, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-102-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 95 however, China has refused to provide copies of legal measures in response to legitimate requests directed to its enquiry point. In April 2020, for example, the United States submitted a request concerning five Chinese legal measures covering semiconductors and fisheries subsidy programs that had not been published in China’s official journal and were not otherwise available online, nor had they been notified to the WTO. Despite the obligation in its WTO accession agreement to either provide the documents or respond in writing within 45 days, China did not meet this deadline. The United States made repeated follow-up requests, to no avail. Five months after the United States submitted its request to China’s enquiry point, MOFCOM orally informed the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that it would not be providing any of the requested legal measures because two of the measures would soon be replaced and the other three measures, in China’s view, were not relevant to China’s WTO obligations. USTR promptly responded to MOFCOM in writing, countering its assertions and urging it to provide the requested documents. Since then, China has continued to refuse to provide a written response to the United States’ request or to provide any of the requested legal measures, even though the United States and other WTO Members have repeatedly raised this matter. Other Non-Tariff Measures A number of other non-tariff measures can adversely affect the ability of U.S. industry to access or invest in China’s market. Key areas of concern include laws governing land use in China, commercial dispute resolution, and the treatment of NGOs. Corruption among Chinese Government officials, enabled in part by China’s incomplete adoption of the rule of law, is also a key area of concern. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-103-2048.jpg) ![96 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS COLOMBIA TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement The United States–Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (CTPA) entered into force on May 15, 2012. The United States and Colombia work closely to review the implementation and functioning of the CTPA and to address outstanding issues. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Since January 1, 2021, most U.S. consumer and industrial products have been imported duty free into Colombia pursuant to the CTPA. Duties on some remaining U.S. agricultural goods were phased out on January 1, 2023. Tariffs on the most sensitive products for Colombia will be phased out between January 1, 2026, and January 1, 2030. U.S. agricultural exporters also currently benefit from duty-free access under tariff-rate quotas for some sensitive products. Non-Tariff Barriers Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Colombia has not yet implemented customs reforms that would allow traders to submit electronic copies of invoices instead of physical copies, as encouraged by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. Slow customs clearance in Colombia hampers both imports and exports, and the ability to submit electronic copies of documents would help accelerate customs clearances. The Colombian Government reports that its digital system is under development, and the United States will continue to follow the development of this system. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Conformity Assessment Requirements for Automobile and Motorcycle Parts Since March 2021, Colombia has proposed seven measures that impose a new third-party certification requirement for several components of imported vehicles. Colombia notified these measures to the WTO between August 2022 and August 2024. U.S. manufacturers report that they are unable to comply with the measures because there is not sufficient capacity for third-party certification. Moreover, U.S. manufacturers already test their products for compliance with U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and stakeholders argue that Colombia has not demonstrated a need for further testing. As a result of persistent U.S. engagement with Colombia, implementation of these measures has been delayed several times to provide additional time to identify a mutually satisfactory solution. Most recently, implementation of proposed measures affecting tires and brakes was delayed until May 2025, but regulations on seatbelts, glazing, and retro-reflective tape will enter into force in March 2025.

This resolution includes technical regulations on labeling of cosmetic and personal care products and prohibits existing labels to comply with specific Andean Community labeling requirements. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Lactic Acid and Bulk Dried Milk In August 2020, Colombia’s National Institute for Surveillance of Medicines and Food (INVIMA) informed the United States that all U.S. shipments of milk powder to Colombia must meet the physical and chemical properties requirements in Decree 616 of 2006, including minimum lactic acid content requirements. The WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (WTO SPS Committee) was notified of Decree 616 in 2005 and again in 2012. The scientific basis and rationale for the regulation remain unclear. Colombia’s stated goal for the decree is to align with the standards outlined in the Codex Alimentarius. However, the Codex Alimentarius Commission standard for milk powders establishes maximum levels for titratable acidity as an additional quality factor, not a minimum requirement and not affecting the identity or safety of the food. In July 2022, Colombia published a draft amendment to Decree 616, which continued to include mandatory minimum lactic acid requirements for milk powder. On September 16, 2024, Colombia’s Ministry of Health notified for domestic consultation an updated draft of the amendment to Decree 616. This draft still contains minimum lactic acid requirements and introduces a new measure that prohibits the reconstitution of milk powder into liquid milk. On September 30, 2024 the United States submitted comments on the draft amendment. As of December 31, 2024, the draft had not yet been notified for international consultation through the WTO. New Facility Registration Requirements In July 2021, Colombia notified to the WTO implementation procedures for Decree 2478 of 2018, which creates the process whereby countries gain approval to export products deemed higher risk to Colombia, including through new foreign facility approval requirements. The new procedures will affect foreign countries’ ability to export meat, poultry, dairy, seafood, and egg products to Colombia. The United States provided comments on the measure to Colombia in September 2021, requesting clarification of enforcement procedures and a change to the procedures to reduce trade barriers, including burdensome and costly auditing requirements that are not in line with international standards. In April 2022, Colombia agreed to exempt U.S. meat and poultry products from these procedures due to the February 2006 side letter under the CTPA that recognizes the U.S. Inspection and Surveillance system for meat and poultry products as equivalent. However, further improvements still need to be made in order to allow the continued export of egg, seafood, and dairy products. After the United States expressed additional concerns during the April 2023 CTPA Meeting of the Standing Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters, Colombia released updated procedures for the implementation of Decree 2478 in May 2024. These procedures still contained several barriers to trade for the United States, including the requirement for national health authorities to register foreign facilities directly with the Colombian Government. The final procedures for Decree 2478 of 2018 are set to go into force on July 31, 2025. The United States submitted additional comments through local consultation on June 8, 2024, and is continuing to work with Colombia to find a solution so that U.S. facilities are exempt from new requirements. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-105-2048.jpg) ![98 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Colombia’s Ministry of National Defense requires government-to-government agreements for some defense procurements, a stipulation that excludes U.S. companies from participation. The U.S. Government lacks the authority to act as a guarantor in procurement contracts between foreign governments and U.S. firms and, as a result, several major U.S. companies have been negatively impacted by this requirement. The United States continues to engage with Colombia to remove this restrictive requirement for defense procurements. Colombia is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since February 1996. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Colombia remained on the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. Colombia has not yet implemented the provisions of the CTPA regarding enforcement against online copyright infringement and has not yet acceded to the 1991 Act of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. During 2024, the United States continued to engage with Colombia on these outstanding CTPA commitments. The San Andresitos markets, a collection of over 600 shopping centers across Colombia, were added to the 2025 Notorious Markets List due to the prevalence of counterfeit goods sold. In 2018, Colombia issued Decree 433 and Decree 710 to clarify that Colombia would not condition regulatory approvals for pharmaceuticals on factors other than the safety and efficacy of the underlying compound. An action brought by a private citizen challenging both of these decrees led Colombia’s Council of State to provisionally suspend the decrees in September 2019. As of December 31, 2024, Colombia was still considering how it will resolve the uncertainty caused by the suspended decrees. Colombia continues to face a large number of pirated and counterfeit goods crossing the border or sold at markets, on the street, and at other distribution hubs around the country. High levels of digital piracy persist, and Colombia has not curtailed the number of free-to-air devices, community antennas, and unlicensed Internet Protocol Television services that permit the retransmission of otherwise-licensed content to a large number of nonsubscribers. SERVICES BARRIERS Distribution Services A section of Colombia’s commercial code provides protections for agents that can make it difficult and costly for companies to terminate a commercial agent (sales representative) contract.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Colombia brought its Significant Economic Presence (SEP) tax into force on January 1, 2024, per Article 57 of Law 2277 of 2022. The tax applies to the sale of tangible goods and digital services. A non-resident entity has SEP status and is subject to the tax if: 1) it has deliberate and systematic interaction with the Colombian market (defined, in part, as maintaining a marketing interaction with 300,000 or more customers in Colombia); and 2) it obtains gross income of at least “31,300 Tax Value Units” (for 2025, approximately $370,000) from transactions involving the sale of goods or services in the Colombian market.

LABOR The United States and Colombia continue to consult on labor issues pursuant to Article 17.5.5 of the CTPA. This engagement includes discussing Colombia’s progress on implementing specific recommendations contained in a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) report. The DOL report, published in 2017, raises significant concerns regarding labor law enforcement throughout Colombia, especially with respect to the right to freedom of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, violence against unionists, and impunity for the perpetrators of the violence. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-107-2048.jpg) ![100 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS COSTA RICA TRADE AGREEMENTS Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement The Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA–DR) entered into force for the United States and El Salvador on March 1, 2006, for Honduras and Nicaragua on April 1, 2006, for Guatemala on July 1, 2006, for the Dominican Republic on March 1, 2007, and for Costa Rica on January 1, 2009. The United States and the other CAFTA–DR countries meet regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the Agreement and to address outstanding issues. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs As a member of the Central American Common Market, Costa Rica applies a harmonized external tariff on most items at a maximum of 15 percent, with some exceptions. However, under the CAFTA–DR, as of January 1, 2015, U.S. non-agricultural goods enter Costa Rica duty free. In addition, nearly all U.S. agricultural exports enter Costa Rica duty free under the CAFTA–DR. Costa Rica eliminated its tariffs on certain U.S. rice and dairy products on January 1, 2025. For certain agricultural products, tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) permit duty-free access for specified quantities during the tariff phase- out period, with the duty-free quantities expanding during that period. Costa Rica will liberalize trade in fresh potatoes and onions through continual expansion of a TRQ, rather than the reduction of the out-of- quota tariff. Costa Rica is required under the CAFTA–DR to make TRQs available on January 1 of each year. Costa Rica monitors its TRQs through an import licensing system, which the United States carefully tracks to ensure the timely issuance of these import licensing permits. Taxes Costa Rica assesses an excise tax on distilled spirits calculated as a percentage of alcohol per liter, based on three specific rates (Law 7972). The highest rate applies to spirits bottled at a rate above 30 percent alcohol-by-volume (abv). Locally-produced spirits (produced in the largest volume by the state-owned alcohol company) are bottled at 30 percent abv, but most internationally traded spirits are bottled at 40 percent abv. As a result, most imported spirits are taxed at a higher rate than most spirits produced domestically. Furthermore, domestic producers may pay the tax within the first 15 days of each month on sales made during the prior month, while importers must pay the tax prior to release of their product from customs. SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS The Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture occasionally delays the issuance of phytosanitary import permits for sensitive products during specific periods, such as harvest time (e.g., usually from April to June for onions), creating difficulties for U.S. exporters of those products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture conduct frequent bilateral meetings to discuss regulatory procedures for the import and export of new products, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-108-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 101 promoting market access for new U.S. products. Costa Rica’s market for U.S. tablestock potatoes has been closed since 2013, and USDA and the Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture are discussing the final requirements to reopen this market. The United States exported approximately $3.4 million of chipping potatoes to Costa Rica in 2024; however, industry estimates that U.S. potato exports could increase to over $5 million if phytosanitary issues are addressed and the table-stock potato market reopened. A 2016 Costa Rican regulation requires completion of extensive questionnaires for certain animal product facilities that export products to Costa Rica, including dairy, seafood, lamb, and egg product facilities. Most U.S. exporting facilities have complained that the questionnaire requires disclosure of irrelevant and business proprietary information. As a result, U.S. exports of these products face delays of several months or longer when introducing new products to the Costa Rican market. The USDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration have engaged Costa Rica’s National Animal Health Service to advocate for a less burdensome alternative to the questionnaire for U.S. exporters. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT U.S. companies have indicated that the private sector is sometimes disadvantaged in public bids when competing against Costa Rican state-owned enterprises in both the information and communications technology and insurance sectors. Article 2 of the Public Contracting Law allows for the noncompetitive awarding of contracts to public entities if officials of the awarding entity certify the award to be an efficient use of public funds. The United States has engaged with Costa Rica on these issues. Costa Rica is not a Party to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but is an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since June 2015. Costa Rica applied for GPA accession on September 28, 2023. Costa Rica has binding international procurement obligations under the CAFTA–DR. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Costa Rica was removed from the Watch List in the 2020 Special 301 Report due to the concrete steps it took to improve its intellectual property (IP) regime, including initiating new programs within the government to track licenses to address unlicensed software use in the central government, and to implement an online recordation system to improve border enforcement. While the United States recognizes the progress Costa Rica has made, and the potential of these positive developments, their effectiveness remains to be demonstrated through enforcement and outcomes on the ground. Costa Rica’s IP Registry issued its second report on government usage of unlicensed software in July 2022, with results of the use of legal software at 95 government institutions. The decree that calls for these reports does not mandate they be published, and neither the first nor the second report has been published. The Public Procurement Directorate of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Trade are working to create public procurement guidelines to enforce the purchase and use of legal software by government institutions. The Public Procurement Directorate is responsible for reporting to the President, the Revenue Control Commission, and the Government Expenditures Commission of the National Assembly on compliance with the public procurement guidelines. The United States continues to request that Costa Rica publish the results of the reports. The United States also continues to urge Costa Rica to bolster IP enforcement to curb online piracy, address cumbersome border measure processes to deter counterfeit and pirated goods, and effectively utilize ex officio authority for border enforcement against counterfeit and pirated goods. The Inter-Institutional Commission for the Protection and Promotion of Intellectual Property (CIPPI) is working to include the Fiscal Control Police on the Commission to support ex officio procedures. Costa Rica has implemented an ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-109-2048.jpg) ![102 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS online recordation system that provides information to improve border enforcement but is not as robust as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection e-Recordation Program.

The Association of Intellectual Property Professionals of Costa Rica (APPICR) is developing a legal proposal for the donation of a registration program, which will be linked to Costa Rica’s customs system. The United States continues to encourage Costa Rica to build on initial positive steps to protect and enforce IP and to continue bilateral discussions of these issues. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-110-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 103 COTE D’IVOIRE IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs Côte d’Ivoire’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 12.1 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Côte d’Ivoire’s average MFN applied tariff rate remained 15.8 percent for agricultural products and 11.5 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Côte d’Ivoire has bound 33.3 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 11.2 percent. Consistent with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Common External Tariff (CET), Côte d’Ivoire applies: (1) zero percent duty on essential social goods (e.g., medicine); (2) 5 percent duty on essential commodities, raw materials, and capital goods; (3) 10 percent duty on intermediate goods; (4) 20 percent duty on final consumer goods; and (5) 35 percent duty on certain goods that the Ivoirian Government elected to afford greater protection. The CET is based on the 2022 Harmonized System nomenclature developed by the World Customs Organization. Since 2021, the tariff rate was reduced to 9 percent for milk (but not yogurt and other dairy products), infant milk, homogenized and composite preparation foods for infants, imported rice, meat imported from outside ECOWAS, pasta products containing 100 percent durum wheat semolina, and equipment designed for solar energy. The Ivoirian Government applies a tariff of 1,000 CFA (approximately $1.70) per kilogram to imports of frozen poultry. Taxes Imports from countries that are not members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) are subject to an additional 2.5 percent tax on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of imports, which consists of the solidarity tax (0.8 percent), African Union import tax (0.2 percent), ECOWAS community levy (0.5 percent), and statistical charge (1.0 percent), all of which are used for financing WAEMU commissions and assisting landlocked WAEMU members Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Like all ECOWAS countries, Côte d’Ivoire imposes a 1 percent ECOWAS levy on all goods originating from non-ECOWAS countries to finance the activities of the ECOWAS Commission and Community institutions. Côte d’Ivoire levies an additional 1 percent charge on the CIF value of imports, except those destined for re-export, transit, or donations for humanitarian purposes under international agreements. An import tax of 15 percent is applied on imports of electrical transformers from 16 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) to 500 kVA. Excise duties apply to certain imports, including alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverages, perfume, cosmetic products, marble, oil products, and tourism vehicles with at least 13 horsepower. The import tax on cosmetic products containing hydroquinone is 15 percent. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-111-2048.jpg) ![104 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Non-Tariff Barriers A number of items are subject to import prohibitions, restrictions, or prior authorization, including: certain petroleum products, animal products, flour, live plants, seeds, plastic bags, distilling equipment, and analog televisions. Textile imports are subject to some authorization requirements by the External Trade Promotion Office. Import Bans Côte d’Ivoire has prohibited wheat flour imports without iron and folic acid fortification since 2008. In January 2020, Côte d’Ivoire banned the importation of sugar for five years. By doing so, Côte d’Ivoire ensures the consumption of domestically-produced sugar and protects a well-known national company in this sector. Two local companies are authorized to import sugar in case of a national shortage. Import Restrictions A regulation in force since July 2018 limits the age of imported used vehicles to a maximum of five years. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation All goods imported into Côte d’Ivoire must first be examined by a pre-shipment inspection company for compliance with relevant requirements. U.S. exporters find the process often increases the time and cost to export without providing assurance of a more streamlined clearance process at the border. Four European companies—BIVAC (affiliated with the French group Bureau Veritas), Swiss-based firms COTECNA and SGS, and British company Intertek—are contracted to carry out pre-shipment inspections of goods exported to Côte d’Ivoire with a value exceeding 1 million CFA (approximately $1,700). A certificate of compliance from one of these firms is required to clear customs. In 2023, customs authorities enforced a rule mandating that all imported containers must undergo a verification scan before being allowed to enter the country. Côte d’Ivoire notified its latest update to its customs valuation legislation to the WTO in June 2002, but it has not yet responded to the WTO Checklist of Issues that describes how the Customs Valuation Agreement is being implemented. Minimum Import Prices The Ivoirian Government imposes minimum import prices on certain products including cooking oil, sugar, used clothing, concentrated tomato paste, broken rice, matches, notebooks, tissues, polypropylene sacks, alcohol, and milk. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Since becoming a WTO Member, in 1995, Côte d’Ivoire has not consistently notified draft measures to the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade nor the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. Transparency of the regulatory system in Côte d’Ivoire is a concern, as companies complain that regulations are issued only as final measures without a clear process or a period for public comment on draft regulations. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-112-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 105 GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT The Ivoirian Government publishes tender notices in the local press and sometimes publishes tenders in international magazines and newspapers. On occasion, there is a charge for the bidding documents. Côte d’Ivoire has a generally decentralized government procurement system, with most ministries undertaking their own procurements. The National Bureau of Technical and Development Studies—the government’s technical and investment planning agency and think tank—occasionally serves as an executing agency in major projects to be financed by international institutions. The Public Procurement Department is a centralized office of public tenders in the Ministry of Finance to help ensure compliance with international bidding practices. Côte d’Ivoire’s update to its public procurement code in July 2019 introduced some positive changes, including electronic procurement, provisions on sustainable procurement, and promotion of socially responsible vendors as part of the qualification criteria. While the public procurement process is required by law to use open procedures, in practice it is often opaque and government contracts are occasionally awarded in a non-transparent manner. Some companies appear to secure contracts as a result of longstanding relationships with government officials or aided by partnerships with Ivoirian commercial entities that have close connections to the government. In other instances, although specific regulations govern the use of sole source procurements, the government has awarded sole source bids without going through the tendering procedures, citing the high technical capacity of a specific firm or a declared emergency. Many firms continue to cite corruption as an obstacle to a transparent understanding of procurement decisions. Côte d’Ivoire is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement, but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since July 2020. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Inadequate enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights remains a serious concern. The Ivoirian Copyright Office (BURIDA) uses a labeling system to combat counterfeiting and piracy in audio, video, literary, and artistic works. BURIDA has also facilitated stakeholder engagement to promote IP, and its police unit still conducts some raids to confiscate pirated CDs and DVDs; however, due to recent streaming alternatives, CDs and DVDs are circulated less and less in the market. In 2023, Côte d’Ivoire made efforts to operationalize the National Committee for the Fight against Counterfeiting (CNLC), which was created by decree in 2014, accepts IP enforcement complaints from stakeholders, and reportedly will conduct seizures on right holders’ behalf. However, detailed information about the CNLC’s activities is not publicly available. Counterfeit goods are also widely available throughout the country. IP enforcement continues to suffer in Côte d’Ivoire due to limited resources and a lack of customs checks at the country’s porous borders. SERVICES BARRIERS The chartered accountants’ association of Côte d’Ivoire prohibits registration of foreign nationals, with the exception of those who have practiced in Côte d’Ivoire for several years under the license of an Ivoirian practitioner. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-113-2048.jpg) ![106 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS INVESTMENT BARRIERS Côte d’Ivoire has restrictions on and requires prior approval for foreign investment in the health sector, law and accounting firms, petroleum and gas, and travel agencies. Majority foreign ownership of companies in these sectors is not permitted, and all foreign companies currently operating in these sectors do so in partnership with local firms. OTHER BARRIERS Bribery and Corruption Bribery and corruption remain a significant concern. Stakeholders report that bribes are sometimes solicited to speed up the slow bureaucratic process or to secure public tenders. The High Authority of Good Governance (HABG) is an independent administrative authority that is nominally under the Office of the President. It is responsible for executing the national plan to fight corruption and investigating allegations of corruption. In 2021, the HABG undertook an audit of Ivoirian parastatal companies in key sectors. Several parastatals’ managers have been suspended from their positions. In addition, 14 entities (11 public companies and 3 private companies) in the health sector were charged with corruption. Corruption, opaque business practices, and capacity constraints on the judiciary and in law enforcement have resulted in poor enforcement of the law. This situation has been particularly acute with regard to the protection of private property rights, particularly when the subject of the judicial proceeding or law enforcement action is a foreigner and the plaintiff is Ivoirian or a long-established foreign resident. These situations are further complicated by conflicting modern and traditional concepts of land tenure, the latter including communal ownership. In July 2022, the government launched Spacia, a platform for monitoring and preventing acts of corruption and similar offenses. Export Policies Côte d’Ivoire’s 2021–2025 National Development Plan prioritizes agro-industrial development. As a result, the government provides incentives and supports funds to investors expanding agro-industrial processing of locally grown cashew, cocoa, and other commodities for export. The government also incentivizes domestic processing of agricultural commodities such as cocoa, rubber, palm oil, and coffee, by imposing a higher export tax on unprocessed commodities. The government prohibits the export of iron products. Exports of metallic ores, gems, and precious metals require prior authorization from both the Ministry of Mines, Petroleum, and Energy and the Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Development. On May 7, 2024, Côte d’Ivoire suspended the purchase of raw cashew nuts by exporters and the export of raw cashew nuts to ensure a supply for local processing plants. Only the purchase of raw cashew nuts by approved processors and buyers for supply to processing units is authorized. The suspension of exports did not apply to products that had already been authorized for packaging. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-114-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 107 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TRADE AGREEMENTS Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement The Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA–DR) entered into force for the United States and El Salvador on March 1, 2006, for Honduras and Nicaragua on April 1, 2006, for Guatemala on July 1, 2006, for the Dominican Republic on March 1, 2007, and for Costa Rica on January 1, 2009. The United States and the other CAFTA–DR countries meet regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the Agreement and to address outstanding issues. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs Under the CAFTA–DR, as of January 1, 2015, U.S. non-agricultural goods enter the Dominican Republic duty free. In addition, nearly all U.S. agricultural exports enter the Dominican Republic duty free under the CAFTA–DR. Under the CAFTA–DR, the Dominican Republic agreed to eliminate its tariffs on rice, chicken leg quarters, and some dairy products on January 1, 2025. For certain agricultural products, tariff- rate quotas (TRQs) permitted duty-free access for specified quantities during the tariff phase-out period. The Dominican Republic is required under the CAFTA–DR to make TRQs available on January 1 of each year. On December 31, 2024, Decree-693-24 took effect. The decree provides for the Dominican Republic to retain, in perpetuity, the CAFTA-DR TRQ from the nineteenth year of the Agreement: a 23,300 metric ton duty-free quota for rice exports from the United States. Any exports beyond that quota would be subject to a 99 percent tariff. U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns that the Dominican Republic may be taking steps that appear to undermine its obligations under the CAFTA-DR. The United States is closely following this issue and engaging bilaterally with the Dominican Republic to address it. Taxes U.S. ethanol imported into the Dominican Republic is subject to an internal 10 percent ad valorem tax and an excise tax of approximately $11 per liter, and these taxes disincentivize importation of U.S. ethanol. Imported ethanol is also subject to the internal Tax on Transfer of Industrial Goods and Services (ITBIS) at a rate of 18 percent. This practice disadvantages U.S. exports as locally-produced ethanol is not subject to these internal taxes. Cheese importers face unequal treatment with regard to taxation; imported cheese is subject to the ITBIS of 18 percent, while locally-produced cheese is not. This puts U.S exports of these products at a competitive disadvantage. In meetings conducted from 2020 to 2023, the Dominican Republic Government advised that the General Directorate of Internal Taxes (DGII) had discussed implementing the ITBIS on local cheese producers through a schedule. The DGII has not made any progress on this proposed implementation. The U.S. Government will continue to work with the DGII to seek a resolution of this issue. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-115-2048.jpg) ![108 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Non-Tariff Barriers Import Licensing The Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Agriculture continues to administer import licenses as a means to manage trade in sensitive commodities such as rice, beans, dairy, sugar, poultry, beef, pork, onions, and garlic and intermittently with respect to other products. In August 2004, a side letter was signed under the CAFTA–DR by the United States and the Dominican Republic affirming that the Dominican Republic would not grant or deny import licenses on the basis of unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary concerns, domestic purchasing requirements, or discretionary criteria. However, the need to obtain an import license from the Ministry of Agriculture and the way in which the licensing process is handled can lead to inconsistent application of the law and uneven treatment. Importers of U.S.-made used vehicles less than five years old have reported that the Dominican Republic customs authority frequently has challenged the eligibility of those vehicles for preferential tariff treatment under the CAFTA–DR, citing technical difficulties in demonstrating compliance with the rules of origin. The United States continues to engage with the Dominican Republic to address these complaints. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Regulation of Steel Rebar Multiple U.S. exporters of steel rebar used for construction have complained that a Dominican Republic technical regulation (RTD 458) constitutes a barrier to trade. Dominican Republic authorities have required imported U.S. rebar to be sampled and tested by third-party laboratories, which is not required of domestic production. Because no suitable third-party laboratories exist in the Dominican Republic, samples have been sent back to the United States for testing. These conformity assessment procedures lack transparency in their application and have unduly increased the cost and time required for commercialization of rebar in the Dominican Republic. The United States has continued to engage with U.S. companies and Dominican Republic authorities on this issue. While Dominican Republic authorities have worked with certain individual companies in the U.S. steel industry to accept test results and certify rebar before export so that products may clear customs and enter commerce in the Dominican Republic without delay, the Dominican Republic has yet to reform the regulations and practices to ensure that imported rebar is treated no less favorably than domestically manufactured rebar. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Delays in the process for obtaining sanitary registrations from the Dominican Republic for foods, medicines, and health products have historically resulted in higher operating costs and delays moving products to market, according to industry representatives. Since June 5, 2023 when the General Directorate of Medicines, Food, and Health Products (DIGEMAPS) became a decentralized institution, independent from the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, the process has improved. The U.S. Government continues to work with DIGEMAPS to improve the process and move toward a risk-based inspection registration process that will facilitate entry of U.S. pre-packaged products into the Dominican Republic. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-116-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 109 GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT U.S. suppliers have complained that government procurement in the Dominican Republic is not always conducted in a transparent manner and that corruption is a problem. The U.S. Government has engaged with the Dominican Republic Government on this issue and transparency has increased in its procurement system over the last few years. In a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the United States and the Dominican Republic in October 2020, the Dominican Republic Government expressed its intent to prioritize passage of new legislation on public procurement and implement it in a manner that is timely, transparent, and consistent with international best practices. In September 2023, while waiting for Congress to consider a draft law on government procurement, the Government of the Dominican Republic enacted a new Regulation for the Application of Law No. 340-06 on Procurement and Contracting of Goods, Services and Works by Decree 416-23 of the Executive Branch of the Dominican Republic. This regulation replaced the previous Regulation on Procurement and Contracting of Goods, Services, and Works No. 543-12 of 2012. The new implementing regulation addresses transparency and electronic procurement portals, methodology on micro-purchases, streamlining participation for foreign companies, integrity and mitigation risks for vendors, best value for money, transparency of government procurement committees, exception rules, and sustainability in the evaluation criteria. A draft government procurement law that would have codified many of the reforms in the new implementing regulation expired in January 2025 after the Chamber of Deputies failed to vote on the bill. The Dominican Republic is not a Party to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since September 2022. The Dominican Republic has binding international procurement obligations under the CAFTA–DR. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION The Dominican Republic was removed from the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. The Dominican Republic continues to demonstrate political will to improve intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, including the creation in December 2022 of the National Inter-Ministerial Council of Intellectual Property, to coordinate the agencies involved in IP protection and enforcement and ensure cooperation and information sharing. Despite this progress, some concerns remain with online and signal piracy and the widespread sale of counterfeit goods. The United States continues to urge the Dominican Republic to improve coordination among enforcement agencies and to ensure such agencies are adequately funded and staffed. LABOR A review of the Dominican Republic’s progress on implementing specific recommendations from the United States to improve worker rights practices in the Dominican Republic sugar sector has been ongoing since the issuance of a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) report in 2013. The DOL report, published in response to a submission from the public under the CAFTA–DR, raised concerns regarding labor law enforcement in the sugar sector related to acceptable conditions of work, the minimum age for work and the worst forms of child labor, and forced labor. In its seventh report of review, published in September 2022, the DOL detailed ongoing concerns and challenges in the Dominican Republic’s sugar industry.

Ecuador has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 21.9 percent. When Ecuador joined the WTO in January 1996, it bound most of its tariff rates at or below 30 percent ad valorem; most products bound at higher rates are agricultural products covered by the Andean Price Band System (APBS). Ecuador agreed to phase out its participation in the APBS when it joined the WTO; however, as of December 2023 Ecuador had taken no steps to phase out use of the APBS. As a member of the Andean Community of Nations (CAN), Ecuador grants and receives exemptions from tariffs (i.e., reduced ad valorem tariffs and no application of the APBS) for products from the other CAN countries. Ecuador still imposes a mixed tariff (composed of an ad valorem tariff and a specific tariff) on approximately 360 products, including textiles and shoes. In some cases, the mixed tariff appears to result in a 40 percent ad valorem equivalent tariff rate. Agricultural Products Ecuador’s continued use of the APBS affects many U.S. agricultural exports by subjecting them to a variable levy or surcharge (on top of an ad valorem tariff) that increases in absolute terms as world prices decrease. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-119-2048.jpg) ![112 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans and Restrictions COMEX Resolution 009-2022, which lists prohibited and restricted imports, was amended in August 2023 and includes: a revised list of products that require pre-shipment control documentation, updated automatic and non-automatic import license requirements, and a list of tariff subheadings subject to prior control documentation for products imported under quota within the framework of current trade agreements. The resolution also eliminated pre-shipment control documents for 601 tariff lines. Import Licensing Products subject to a non-automatic import license requirement include certain polymers. Products subject to an automatic import license requirement include remanufactured parts of aviation engines; blocks and cylinder heads; cylinder liners, connecting rods, pistons, rings, carburetors, and their parts; valves, crankcases, injectors and other parts for fuel systems; and piston pins, among others. Import Licensing for Agriculture Products Ecuador subjects all food and agricultural imports to an import licensing regime. Stakeholders indicate that the review process for import licensing applications is often lengthy and lacks transparency. COMEX and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) impose a further mandatory and cumbersome process for allocating import licenses for 55 agricultural tariff lines, including potatoes (including frozen french fries), beef, pork, chicken, turkey, soybean meal, beans, sorghum, and corn. For these products, an importer’s total annual import allowance cannot surpass an amount determined by the MAG, in some cases in consultation with domestic producers of the same commodities. For most products subject to the licensing system, MAG also requires that interested parties provide sales and consumption forecasts before it will authorize imports. In the case of wheat, corn, soybean meal, and pork, the MAG requires proof that the product is being purchased locally to assign amounts for import licenses. Permits are limited to a single shipment, meaning that importers are required to repeat the lengthy application process each time they seek to import these products. In cases where import licenses are not approved, the Ecuadorian Government does not typically notify companies or provide a formal explanation for the denial. The Ecuadorian Food Safety and Inspection Service (AGROCALIDAD) Resolution 115-2019 requires registration of processing facilities for veterinary inputs and for livestock products and byproducts to receive import licenses. Stakeholders claim that the facility registration regime requires disclosure of proprietary and confidential information. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE Cosmetics and Personal Care Andean Community Resolution 2310, entered into force on December 17, 2024. This resolution includes technical regulations on labeling of cosmetic and personal care products. U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns with the resolution, including that it prohibits existing labels to comply with specific Andean Community labeling requirements, requires translation of brand names or generic terms like “eau de ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-120-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 113 toilette,” and requires the change of long-standing brand names or product names. Stakeholders also report that Ecuador’s Health Agency (ARCSA) was applying the resolution prior to its entry into force. SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Terbufos On July 19, 2024, the Phytosanitary Control Agency, an agency under the Ministry of Agriculture, issued Resolution 0102 prohibiting the import of products containing the active ingredient Terbufos and eliminating existing registrations of such products, as established by Decision 804 (August 2015) of the Andean Community regarding the “Andean Standard for the Registration and Control of Chemical Pesticides for Agricultural Use.” GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Government procurement in Ecuador can be cumbersome, nontransparent, and marked by corruption. Government institutions reportedly delay payments without explanation despite adequate provision of goods and services and proper work orders and receipts. The lack of transparency poses a risk that procuring entities will administer a procurement to the advantage of a preferred supplier. Ecuador is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since June 2019. Government-to-Government Contracts with the Ministry of Defense The Ecuadorian Ministry of Defense (MOD) invites foreign companies to participate in military purchasing processes through their respective countries’ embassies in Quito. According to Article 50 of the Regulation for the Procurement of Goods for National Defense, foreign embassies must submit a letter to MOD that authorizes technology transfer for these contracts. U.S. companies are unable to compete for these government-to-government contracts because the MOD does not recognize export licenses the U.S. embassy issues as equivalent to Article 50 requirements. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Ecuador remained on the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. Among other issues, enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights against widespread counterfeiting and piracy remains weak both online and in physical markets. In addition, the 2016 Code of the Social Economy of Knowledge, Creativity, and Innovation (COESCCI), also known as the Ingenuity Code, contains legislation covering multiple IP matters. In December 2020, Ecuador published the final regulations implementing the COESCCI. The regulations do not fully address concerns raised by the United States and stakeholders on issues related to copyright exceptions and limitations, patentable subject matter, and geographical indications. Ecuador’s National Intellectual Property Service continues to consider amendments to the COESCCI and to review feedback from stakeholders, though it has not communicated a timeframe for revisions. The United States continues to engage with Ecuador on IP issues, including with respect to revisions to COESCCI and its implementing regulations, through the Special 301 process and the TIC. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-121-2048.jpg) ![114 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS SERVICES BARRIERS Advertising Ecuador’s Organic Communications Law (LOC) and its implementing regulations have traditionally banned all foreign-produced advertisements in Ecuadorian media outlets. Advertisements were only considered “national” if a majority of the production company’s shareholders were citizens or legal residents of Ecuador and if at least 80 percent of those contributing to an advertisement’s production were Ecuadorian citizens or legal residents. In August 2023, Ecuador published a new regulation that clarifies that the LOC considers “national” advertisements to include those produced in a country with which Ecuador has signed an integration treaty. The definition of an integration treaty is not spelled out in the regulation, but private sector companies have interpreted the change to be a relaxation of LOC rules on advertisements. The requirement that 80 percent of those contributing to an advertisement’s production be Ecuadorian citizens or legal residents remains in place. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Data Localization The Law for the Development of Technological Financial Services (Fintech Law) came into force in December 2022. The Fintech Law amended Article 146 of the Ingenuity Code, which had previously required the localization of strategic sector and national security data. The reform established a classification of data that includes open, reserved, and confidential data. While the Fintech Law maintains data localization requirements for reserved and confidential data, it eliminated the localization requirement for other categories of data. Consequently, companies will now be able to provide storage services for some Ecuadorian data from data centers outside Ecuador. However, under the Ministry of Telecommunications (MINTEL) Agreement 141 of 2011, customers must contract with cloud services providers that rely on data centers outside Ecuador through the National Telecommunications Corporation (CNT), a state-owned company, as a local partner. Personal Data Protection In May 2021, Ecuador’s first Personal Data Protection Law went into effect. On March 28, 2024, Ecuador appointed a Personal Data Protection Superintendent to implement the law. The law establishes that Ecuadorian personal data can only be transferred to organizations or territories that provide adequate levels of protection, a standard yet to be defined by the regulating body creating regulatory uncertainty for U.S. companies. The law also establishes fines on data protection infractions that will come into force in the near term. The penalties range between 0.7 percent and one percent of revenues, based on business volume. The Superintendency issued resolution No. SPDP-2024-0002-R on September 6, 2024 to establish a technical guide for the registration of special proxies for foreign data controllers and data processors that perform personal data processing activities. Resident and non-resident companies had six months (i.e., until March 2025) to comply with these requirements. The United States is committed to working with Ecuador on data protection and privacy issues including conversations to ensure mutual participation in multilateral data privacy certification arrangements that provide a mechanism for companies to facilitate international transfers of personal data in baseline compliance with the laws of participating jurisdictions. INVESTMENT BARRIERS In May 2017, Ecuador’s National Assembly voted to terminate 12 of the country’s Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs), including the United States–Ecuador BIT. The United States–Ecuador BIT was terminated ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-122-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 115 on May 18, 2018, but the sunset provisions of the Agreement protect U.S. investments predating May 18, 2018 for 10 years following the date of termination. Capital Exit Tax Ecuador levies a capital exit tax (ISD) on any form of currency outflow in cash, debit and credit cards, checks, and Internet payment methods. In 2021, Ecuador committed to the gradual phaseout of the 5 percent ISD over four years and issued Executive Decree 182 in August 2021, eliminating the ISD for the aviation industry as a first step. In January 2023, Ecuador issued Executive Decree 643, which committed to gradually reducing the ISD to 2 percent by December 2023. Subsequently, the government paused ISD reduction at 3.5 percent in 2023 due to fiscal challenges. In February 2024, Ecuador increased the ISD to 5 percent as of April 1, 2024. Other Investment Barriers Ecuador’s Energy and Mines Ministry (MEM) has identified illegal mining as a significant deterrent to foreign investment. Ecuador is undertaking efforts to combat illegal mining but lacks adequate resources. The United States has ongoing initiatives to train Ecuadoran authorities to identify and deter illegal mining. Since 2018, Ecuador’s registry of mining concessions has been closed, creating a barrier for new mining investments. However, even with a closed registry, the national mining company, ENAMI EP, can still request mining concessions from MEM. MEM has received international assistance to update its mining tender process and model agreements to meet international standards of transparency and bankability. SUBSIDIES Ecuador offers tax benefits to some exporters through the 2019 Law on Tax Simplification and Progressivity. These include benefits for income taxes, value-added taxes, and excise taxes dependent on the sector and size of the exporter. In February 2024, Ecuador issued regulations to the 2023 Economic Efficiency Law that allow investment contracts to freely manage and transfer funds, promote public-private partnerships, offer a five percent income tax reduction for new and existing companies, and establish procedures for Free Trade Zones. In June 2024, Ecuador partially eliminated the subsidy for low-octane gasolines and introduced a price stabilization system allowing prices to rise up to five percent or fall up to ten percent monthly, based on international oil prices. Ecuador maintains a subsidy on the purchase of domestic diesel fuel, which lowers the price to less than 50 percent of the unsubsidized market price. Due to subsidies, it is not profitable for a private company to import fuels at market prices. In October 2024, Ecuador announced the removal of the electricity subsidy for mining companies. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES Telecommunications MINTEL’s ministerial agreement (MA), MINTEL 141-2011, restricts government procurement of technology services such as fixed telephony, advanced mobile service, internet services, blockchain, cloud computing and hosting, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. Such services must be procured through CNT. Ecuador exempts CNT from paying spectrum fees. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-123-2048.jpg) ![116 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS EGYPT TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Egypt Trade and Investment Framework Agreement The United States and Egypt signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) on July 1, 1999. This Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Egypt. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Egypt’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 19 percent in 2023. Egypt’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 65.1 percent for agricultural products and 11.6 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023. Egypt has bound 99.4 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 36.9 percent. On June 9, 2022, Egypt lowered tariffs under Decree No. 218/2022 on over 150 categories of imported products, including pharmaceuticals and natural gas-powered automobiles, with most reductions aimed at capital goods and inputs for agriculture and industry. These lowered tariff levels remained in place in 2024. Tariffs on agricultural equipment, fertilizer, and seeds have dropped from 5 percent to 2 percent. Tariffs on industrial vehicles, such as aircraft, tractors, railcars, and ships, have fallen from 40 percent to 2 percent, and the duty on natural gas-powered automobiles has fallen from 30 percent to 2 percent. In 2023, under Decree No. 67/2023, Egypt reduced tariffs on imported components for local mobile phone production including peripherals such as headphones, batteries, and cameras, which had ranged from 5 percent to 30 percent, down to 2 percent. Egypt’s tariff on passenger cars with engines of 1600 cubic centimeters (cc) or less is 40 percent, and its tariff on cars with engines of greater than 1600 cc is 135 percent. Tariffs on a number of processed and high-value food products, including poultry, meat, apples, pears, cherries, and almonds, range from 20 percent to 30 percent. Alcoholic beverages for use in the tourism sector have a 300 percent tariff plus a 40 percent sales tax. The tariffs on alcoholic beverages for use outside the tourism sector range from 1,200 percent on beer and 1,800 percent on wine to 3,000 percent on sparkling wine and spirits. On June 3, 2023, the Egyptian Ministry of Finance issued a statement indicating that importers are required to make an advance payment of 1 percent of the estimated taxes and fees due on imported goods, instead of the 30 percent payment previously required. Importers will pay the balance in addition to the customs tariffs when the goods arrive in Egypt. In November 2021, Egypt increased tariffs under Decree 558/2021 for a number of products, including mobile phones. To date, Egypt continues to impose a 10 percent duty on mobile phones. U.S. stakeholders have asserted that Egypt’s tariffs on mobile phones appear to be in excess of its WTO bound rates. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-124-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 117 Non-Tariff Barriers Import Restrictions In July 2006, Egypt issued Ministerial Decree No. 766/2006, lifting the ban on imports of frozen whole birds from all origins. The decree does not reference the import of poultry parts and offal as being permissible, which acts as a de facto ban on U.S. chicken limb and offal exports to Egypt. In 2022, Egypt began allowing shipments of chicken leg quarters from the United States on a limited basis. The United States pushed to expand access for poultry at the October 2024 TIFA meeting in Washington and continues to make this request. Import Licensing The National Food Safety Authority (NFSA) must register and approve all nutritional supplements, specialty foods, and dietary foods according to NFSA Decision No. 1/2018 on the Rules Governing the Registration and Handling of Foods for Special Dietary Uses. Importers must apply for a license to import specialty food products and renew the license every five years. License renewals can cost up to $1,000 per renewal, depending on the product. In December 2021, the NFSA issued Decree No. 11/2021, which more than doubled the cost of conducting an inspection of imported food. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Egypt’s Customs Authority continues to employ reference pricing when assessing duties. Egypt’s Customs Valuation Committee often engages in lengthy deliberations without coming to a final decision on customs valuation appeals filed by U.S. businesses. Egyptian Ministerial Decree No. 86/2023 established a committee to plan for and implement an advance ruling system, following significant engagement by the U.S. Government through the TIFA dialogue and in other bilateral and multilateral fora. The U.S. Government is working closely with Egypt’s Customs Authority on the implementation of an advance ruling system, including on the draft regulation. Egyptian Ministerial Decrees No. 283/2023 and No. 284/2023 implemented a new integrated risk management system for inspecting imported non-food industrial goods. Egyptian Ministerial Decree No. 347/2023 introduced amended customs procedures to facilitate transit trade. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Vehicles U.S. vehicle and automotive parts exports face significant barriers in Egypt. In 2012, Egypt became a Contracting Party to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) 1958 Agreement. As of June 2014, Egypt has applied European Union regional emissions and UNECE safety standards for vehicles and automotive parts, thereby blocking imports of U.S. vehicles that meet comparable U.S. regulatory emissions and safety standards. Egyptian law also prohibits the importation of used vehicles for commercial purposes, pursuant to Ministerial Decree No. 580/1998 and Annex 2 to Ministerial Decree No. 770/2005. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-125-2048.jpg) ![118 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS As noted above, Egypt does not recognize U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), even though U.S. standards achieve comparable regulatory goals. As a result, exports of these goods to Egypt have declined significantly since 2015. The United States has raised this issue in TIFA Council meetings, including the October 2024 TIFA dialogue. As part of the U.S. effort to persuade Egypt to accept vehicles conforming with FMVSS, the United States conducted a regulatory assessment in June 2022 of automotive safety standards. Furthermore, the United States and Egypt held technical consultations and discussions in May 2023 and February 2024 to assist Egypt in understanding FMVSS and the U.S. automotive safety regulatory system so as to allay Egyptian concerns. U.S. and Egyptian stakeholders continue to work together to agree on a mutually satisfactory approach for Egypt to accept FMVSS. Halal Import Requirements In August 2021, the Government of Egypt announced that it would extend the scope of its halal certification requirements to include dairy and other agricultural products in addition to the existing requirement for imports of poultry and meat products. It also announced that IS EG Halal, a private U.S. company, would be the sole certifying body approved to certify exports to Egypt as halal. In December 2021, Egypt notified this measure to the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Committee) with an implementation date of January 29, 2022. However, following U.S. and other WTO Members’ requests, Egypt postponed implementation multiple times, most recently until January 1, 2026. The lack of transparency and the uncertainty created by these new requirements has contributed to a drop in U.S. dairy exports to Egypt. In 2022, the volume of U.S. dairy exports dropped 54 percent to 15 million tons. In 2023, it dropped another 12 percent and a further 20 percent in 2024. In 2024, Egypt published Decision No. 1 of 2023 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reform, General Organization for Veterinary Services, which establishes eligibility requirements for accredited halal certification bodies authorized by the Government of Egypt. As written, the eligibility requirements specified would exclude all U.S. halal certification bodies. In 2024, the Government of Egypt sent a Note Verbale to the U.S. Embassy informing the United States that Halal Markets, LLC would act as a service provider company for IS EG Halal Egypt. However, there has been a lack of information about this entity and the specific role it will have in the halal certification and export of relevant U.S. products to Egypt, despite numerous requests by the United States for clarification. The United States has engaged in bilateral and multilateral fora with Egypt to request that Egypt bring certainty, predictability, and fairness to its halal policy implementation efforts by publishing an implementing regulation and notifying all relevant measures. To ensure uniform implementation, Egypt should provide clarification concerning fee structures, documentation requirements, and production process requirements. Additionally, the United States has requested that Egypt allow U.S. and other halal certification bodies to continue certifying product destined for Egypt, and to suspend any new requirements until additional transparency and flexibility are in place. The sole certification body and lack of certainty on program details appear to have impaired U.S. producers’ ability to export to the country, raising concerns under the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. The United States continues to assess the situation and actively engage with Egypt regarding these matters, including through the TIFA dialogue and in other bilateral and multilateral fora. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Seed Potatoes The United States remains unable to export seed potatoes to Egypt because the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture Central Administration for Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) has not reached consensus with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) on pest risk mitigation ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-126-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 119 measures. Despite several rounds of bilateral technical meetings and numerous exchanges of information, U.S. seed potatoes remain barred from Egypt for over 15 years. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Egypt remained on the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. Egypt has made some efforts to strengthen intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, including by passing Law No. 163/2023 in August 2023 to establish the Egyptian Agency for Intellectual Property. Egypt also adopted a new national IP strategy and a system to facilitate information sharing among customs offices on potential counterfeiting and published patent examination guidelines for biotechnology. Despite these improvements, concerns remain. Egypt continues to lack deterrent-level penalties for IP violations and ex officio authority for customs officials to seize counterfeit and pirated goods at the border. Stakeholders have raised concerns regarding the lack of an effective mechanism for the early resolution of potential patent disputes and the mandatory requirement to record trademark licenses. Additionally, Egypt is not currently a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Performances and Phonograms Treaty or the WIPO Copyright Treaty. SERVICES BARRIERS Express Delivery Services The Egyptian National Post Organization (ENPO) must grant special authorization to foreign-owned private courier and express delivery service suppliers seeking to operate in Egypt. Although express delivery services constitute a separate market, the ENPO requires private foreign express delivery operators to pay a postal agency fee of 10 percent of annual revenue on shipments of less than 35 kilograms (approximately 77 pounds.). Civil Aviation Decree 607/2015 and its amendment, Decree No. 523/2018, require all courier and express delivery services to have at least 60 percent Egyptian ownership and air freight agents to have at least 51 percent Egyptian ownership. Financial Services No legal barriers prohibit foreign banks from establishing branches in Egypt. In May 2023, the Central Bank of Egypt granted a license under the Central Bank and Banking Act (Law 194/2020) to London-based Standard Chartered Bank to establish a branch in Egypt, the first new commercial banking license issued to a foreign bank since 1979. In July 2024, the Central Bank published the regulations and procedures for banks to acquire digital banking licenses and granted preliminary approval to Digital Innovation Company, a subsidiary of Banque Misr, to launch the country’s first digital bank, Onebank. Three state-owned banks (Banque Misr, Banque du Caire, and the National Bank of Egypt) control approximately 60 percent of the banking sector’s total assets. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Egypt’s Personal Data Protection Act, Law No. 151/2020, requires licenses for cross-border data transfers. The United States is monitoring the implementation of this law and its draft regulations, which are expected to be implemented by the Data Protection Authority. The Data Protection Authority had not been established as of October 2024. The United States has engaged with Egypt regarding best practices for privacy and data security through technical assistance engagements in September 2023 and June 2024, and will continue to engage with Egypt through various bilateral and multilateral fora. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-127-2048.jpg) ![120 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS INVESTMENT BARRIERS Egypt implemented investment Law No. 72/2017 in 2017 to address longstanding complaints of foreign investors. Although the law allows foreign investors to operate sole proprietorships and partnerships, it continues to limit the number of non-nationals working at any business to 10 percent of the workforce, or up to 20 percent of the workforce if it is not possible to find Egyptian citizens with the necessary qualifications. Egypt restricts foreign equity in construction and transport services to 49 percent. Since 2023, Egypt has undertaken numerous reforms to its investment-related laws to reduce barriers and expand opportunities for foreign investment. On April 11, 2023, Egyptian Ministerial Decree No. 141/2023 established the Supreme Council for Investment, replacing the Investment Council established in 2016. On July 25, 2023, Egypt passed Law No. 160/2023, which amends Law No. 72/2017. Law No. 160/2023 introduced new investment incentives and expanded the Golden License program—a platform that streamlines permits and approvals required to establish a business. In March 2023, Ministerial Decree No. 876 amended Ministerial Decree No. 3099 of 2019, allowing investors to obtain residency by investing in real estate or bank deposits. In May 2023, the Prime Minister approved amendments to the executive regulations for the Investment Law (Law 72 of 2017) to permit foreign investors to obtain a one-year residency permit, which may be renewed for the duration of their investment project. On October 29, 2023, Egypt issued Law No. 173/2023 amending the Importers Registry Law No. 121/1982 of 1982, lifting the existing 51 percent minimum Egyptian ownership requirement for importers of record. It also made Egyptian companies with foreign ownership eligible to receive an importation license for a 10-year term, subject to meeting other qualifying conditions for the license such as minimum capital reserves or sales revenue. In February 2024, Egypt ratified Law No. 11/2024, amending the Desert Lands Law (No 143/1981), removing any sector-specific limitations to investment that restricted foreign investors and foreign shareholder companies from owning lands in the Sinai Peninsula. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-128-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 121 EL SALVADOR TRADE AGREEMENTS Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement The Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA–DR) entered into force for the United States and El Salvador on March 1, 2006, for Honduras and Nicaragua on April 1, 2006, for Guatemala on July 1, 2006, for the Dominican Republic on March 1, 2007, and for Costa Rica on January 1, 2009. The United States and the other CAFTA–DR countries meet regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the Agreement and to address outstanding issues. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs As a member of the Central American Common Market, El Salvador applies a harmonized external tariff on most items at a maximum of 15 percent, with some exceptions. Under the CAFTA–DR, as of January 1, 2015, U.S. non-agricultural goods enter El Salvador duty free. In addition, nearly all U.S. agricultural exports enter El Salvador duty free under the CAFTA–DR. El Salvador eliminated its tariffs on rice, yellow corn, and chicken leg quarters in January 2023, and eliminated tariffs on dairy products on January 1, 2025. El Salvador is required under the CAFTA–DR to make Tariff rate quota (TRQs) available on January 1 of each year. El Salvador monitors its TRQs through an import licensing system, which the United States carefully tracks to ensure the timely issuance of these permits. Taxes El Salvador, under its general alcoholic beverage law, assesses a specific excise tax on distilled spirits that is applied on a per-liter of alcohol basis, with four specific rates ($0.0325 per liter, $0.05 per liter, $0.09 per liter, and $0.16 per liter). The lowest rate applies only to aguardiente, a locally bottled spirit made from cane sugar. Whiskey, which is exclusively imported, is assessed at the highest rate. Distinctions between types of distilled spirits result in lower tax rates on domestically produced spirits compared to imported products. Non-Tariff Barriers Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation U.S. companies have expressed concerns regarding the inconsistent and discretionary application of customs regulations and procedures, resulting in unpredictable delays and administrative fines. For example, exporting from a duty-free zone is unduly cumbersome, with a requirement that representatives of the receiving company and the shipping company be physically present for the exchange of documents and release of materials. In part to address these concerns, the Salvadoran Government is piloting a program to move duty-free processing online.

The Ministry of Health agreed in in 2019 to accept the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety Inspection Service Form 9060- 5 Meat and Poultry Export Certificate of Wholesomeness for meat and meat products in lieu of the Certificate of Free Sale. Additionally, under the CAFTA–DR, El Salvador granted equivalence to the U.S. sanitary inspection system for beef, pork, and poultry and poultry products, which may make the health certificate requirement unnecessary or duplicative for U.S. exports. Unnecessary and duplicative import requirements provide no discernable food safety benefits and, if the duplicative requirements result in higher prices, also can make U.S. products less competitive in the local marketplace. The United States continues to monitor these import requirements. The United States continues to offer comprehensive technical assistance to support El Salvador’s efforts to bolster, while streamlining, its border procedures. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Animal product exporting facilities are subject to Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) inspection and certification every three years. Because the CAFTA–DR provides equivalence for the U.S. beef, pork, and poultry inspection systems, the inspection and certification requirements apply to only U.S. animal products not covered by the CAFTA–DR, such as pet food and pet food additives or probiotics. Extensive laboratory tests are mandatory for all new imported food products, including samples, even for those low-risk products that are permitted into other markets without testing. To register product samples, the Sanitary Regulation Superintendency (SRS) requires large quantities of the product for testing, including samples of each available flavor of the same product. In addition, SRS only accepts laboratory results from the Ministry of Health’s lab, thus delaying the product registration process. USDA continues to discuss with Salvadoran Government officials a proposal to accept U.S. laboratory results for registration purposes. The Salvadoran Government requires that grain shipments be fumigated at importers’ expense unless they are accompanied by a certificate stating that the grain is free of weed seeds and free from kernel smut pathogen (Tilletia barclayana). Because no chemical treatment is both practical and effective against this fungus, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service cannot issue these certificates. As a result, MAG fumigates all grain shipments at the point of entry to El Salvador. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT U.S. companies have expressed concerns that Salvadoran Government agencies are not always providing sufficient advance notice to foster wide participation in bidding procedures, particularly complex infrastructure works or public-private partnership projects. On March 23, 2023, the Public Procurement Law for government entities and municipalities took effect, replacing the Public Administration and Procurement Contracting Law that had been in force since 2000. The new legislation establishes the National Directorate of Public Procurement, an autonomous entity charged with dictating policies and regulations for government purchases and overseeing contract execution. The legislation has a framework for new purchasing methods, such as competitive bidding for ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-130-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 123 contracts over $87,600, price comparison for contracts under $87,600, and electronic product catalogues for framework agreements for purchases under $87,600, among others. However, strategic infrastructure projects, municipal projects executed under the Directorate of Municipal Works, and purchases by subsidiaries of state-owned companies are exempt. As of December 31, 2024, some implementing regulations remained pending. El Salvador has been operating under a State of Exception since March 2022, which has been extended on a monthly basis. As part of the State of Exception’s implementation, the Salvadoran Government enacted a law, for the length of the State of Exception, that allows the Executive branch to enter negotiations and make direct purchases of goods and services related to the State of Exception without adhering to the Public Procurement Law. El Salvador is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement, nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. El Salvador has binding international procurement obligations under the CAFTA–DR. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION To implement its CAFTA–DR obligations, El Salvador undertook legislative reforms providing for stronger intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, entering into an Accelerated Patent Grant (APG) agreement with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and launched a national strategy on intellectual property. However, several concerns remain, including with counterfeit products, music and video piracy, and the unlicensed use of software. The United States remains concerned about the adequacy of implementing regulations to protect against the unfair commercial use, as well as unauthorized disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The effectiveness of the IP system to address patent issues expeditiously in connection with applications to market pharmaceutical products is unclear. Additionally, the United States continues to engage El Salvador to ensure protections for geographical indications do not negatively impact the existing rights and market access of U.S. stakeholders. The United States will continue to monitor El Salvador’s implementation of its IP obligations under the CAFTA–DR. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Data Localization Requirements On August 17, 2021, the Legislative Assembly passed amendments to the Credit History Law. The amendments introduced data localization requirements mandating credit bureaus and economic agents that report on credit history to store data exclusively in El Salvador and grant unrestricted access to the Central Bank and the Superintendence of the Financial System. U.S. stakeholders have expressed concerns that these requirements could compromise consumer data privacy and protection. The United States continues to engage El Salvador on this issue. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-131-2048.jpg) ![124 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS ETHIOPIA IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs In September 2021, the Government of Ethiopia lifted taxes and tariffs on the importation of wheat, rice, sugar, and edible oil to address rising inflation. Ethiopia’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 15.6 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Ethiopia’s MFN applied tariff rate averaged 20.5 percent for agricultural products and 13.9 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Ethiopia implemented tariff reductions for certain raw materials, intermediate goods, and capital goods to promote the growth of the manufacturing sector in 2021. Ethiopia is not a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and so has no bound tariff rates. Ethiopia has prioritized WTO accession as part of its economic reform program and has committed to working with the United States in the hopes of becoming a Member in 2026. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans and Import Restrictions Ethiopia prohibits imports of used clothing and used or refurbished medical equipment intended for resale. Imports of other goods intended for resale or commercial purposes are permitted, provided payment transactions are carried out through Ethiopian banks. In August 2024, the Finance Ministry relaxed import restrictions on some of the 38 product categories that were previously banned in October 2022. In July 2024, Ethiopia’s Ministry of Transport and Logistics renewed an import ban on new and used internal combustion engine vehicles for personal and commercial use, originally in effect January 2024. This ban ostensibly only permits the import of electric vehicles into Ethiopia. Import Licensing As of July 2023, Ethiopia’s Ministry of Trade and Regional Integration is responsible for issuing online import licenses, a task previously delegated to regional authorities. The online license process is not available in some outlying regions due to lack of internet connectivity. In addition to obtaining an import business license, importers must obtain an import registration number before bringing a product into the country. Customs Barriers Companies complain the Ethiopia Customs Commission frequently changes regulations with no warning, leading to costly delays as goods sit in port while the companies attempt to adjust to new requirements. SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS In preparation for the African Continental Free Trade Area, the Government of Ethiopia is exerting considerable effort to harmonize its national sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards with standards used in African Regional Economic Communities, such as the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-132-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 125 and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. When a national standard is not available for a specific product, Ethiopia defers to the Codex Alimentarius Commission standards. Furthermore, Ethiopia is investing in the expansion of national and regional laboratories, quarantine stations, and standards for quality assurance. SPS-related barriers that impede international trade in Ethiopia are associated with cumbersome requirements for registration and approval of imported products, such as processed foods, planting seeds, fertilizer, and plant protection products. In September 2022, the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority issued an environmental clearance for genetically modified maize, which is a drought-tolerant and insect-resistant variety of maize. If approved for commercial cultivation, the maize would be the first genetically modified food crop in Ethiopia. Stakeholders report that the approval process for commercial imports of genetically modified grains and oilseeds for food and feed remains overly burdensome. Animal Feed Ethiopian regulations prohibit genetically modified feeds and those containing growth stimulating hormones for entry into the Ethiopian market. Importers are required to provide attestation or evidence that the product is free from genetically modified ingredients, although exceptions exist for non-commercial imports of food and feed products, including those for emergency relief purposes, food assistance, and scientific research. Animals and Animal Genetic Materials Ethiopia prohibits the importation of animals and animal genetic materials containing genetically modified organisms or living modified organisms. Infant Formula/Powdered Milk Ethiopian food regulations prohibit the importation of baby food, such as powdered milk or infant formula, containing genetically modified ingredients. Live Cattle Ethiopia has stringent protocols for live cattle imports. The protocol requires vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) disease prior to export, and the vaccine used must be a marker vaccine to distinguish between infection and vaccination. The protocol generally requires strict IBR diagnostic testing for existing breeding cattle herds and newly introduced animals, along with the removal of any animals that test positive. U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has been working with Ethiopian regulatory authorities to amend these requirements in line with World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) guidelines. APHIS proposed to require testing only for animals that have not been vaccinated against IBR and advised Ethiopian regulators that post-vaccination testing can lead to false positive results. However, Ethiopian authorities have not agreed to allow U.S. cattle for export to either test negative or be vaccinated for IBR in line with Chapter 11.8 of the WOAH Code. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Some Ethiopian Government tenders are open to foreign participation and tender announcements are usually public, but many major procurements do not go through a transparent tendering process. Obstacles to foreign participation in government procurement tenders include complicated and inadequately established procedures, repeated cancellation of published requests for proposals, capacity gaps on the part ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-133-2048.jpg) ![126 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS of procurement agencies, delays in decision-making, lack of public information, and corruption. Furthermore, since 2018, several dozen government procurement officials across a variety of Ethiopian Government agencies have been arrested for corruption as part of a broader reform effort. As of December 31, 2024, nearly all 170 Ethiopian federal institutions have begun to process electronic procurements aimed at increased transparency and accountability. Lack of technological infrastructure and capacity limitations, however, challenge the full implementation of electronic procurement. Ethiopia has been engaged in the WTO accession process since 2003 but is not yet a Member and, therefore, it is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Inadequate intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement remain a serious concern in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and has demonstrated an interest in strengthening its IP regime. Ethiopia is not a member of most major international IP treaties, including the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, WIPO Internet Treaties, and the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. On October 1, 2024, the Ethiopian Council of Ministers approved the country’s accession to two IP treaties: the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Madrid Protocol for the International Registration of Marks. Both ratification documents were awaiting parliamentary endorsement as of December 31, 2024. Trademark infringement, especially in the hospitality and retail sectors, continues to be an issue. IP enforcement is inconsistent due to lacking enforcement capacity and coordination among Ethiopian government agencies. The Ethiopian Intellectual Property Authority is responsible for the administration of IP laws, as well as the determination of disputes through the Intellectual Property Tribunal. Actions to combat the sale of counterfeit goods and piracy remain inadequate. SERVICES BARRIERS Financial Services In December 2024, Ethiopia’s Parliament approved a banking proclamation allowing foreign banks to enter the country’s financial sector, although the proclamation text had not yet been published as of that time. The new law allows greater foreign ownership of Ethiopian banks, allowing foreign banks to open branches, establish subsidiaries, or purchase stakes in existing Ethiopian banks. However, the law still limits foreign ownership of Ethiopian banks, restricting the combined foreign-owned share of Ethiopian banks to 49 percent. The proclamation further requires foreign banks to include Ethiopian citizens on their boards and reportedly limits foreigners to one seat on the boards of Ethiopian banks. Few international banks maintain representative offices, and all trade financing is required by law to go through an Ethiopian bank. This creates significant challenges for foreign investors with accounts outside Ethiopia. On December 24, 2022, Ethiopia’s Parliament approved the opening of digital financial services to foreign companies to expand financial services in geographic areas underserved by traditional banks, increase competition in the telecommunications industry, and to facilitate the exchange of technology and knowledge. In September 2023, for the first time, the National Bank of Ethiopia allowed some foreign direct investors to open accounts outside Ethiopia to service external debts, pay for foreign insurance and warranty claims, meet financial obligations to foreign contractors, and cover other foreign capital and operational expenses. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-134-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 127 In November 2023, a U.S.-backed leasing company, which was the only foreign-owned financial services company operating in Ethiopia, closed in response to a multi-year dispute with the Government of Ethiopia over its prohibitions of U.S. dollar-dominated lease agreements. The Council of Ministers approved a bill in June 2024 that would allow foreign banks to open local subsidiaries, branches, or representative offices. Foreign banks would also be allowed to acquire shares in existing banks, although foreign ownership and foreign-owned Ethiopian organizations are limited to no more than 40 percent of total shares. The bill was passed by parliament on December 17, 2024. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Many formal and informal barriers impede foreign investment in Ethiopia. The 2020 Investment Law allows foreign investors to invest in any area except those that are clearly reserved for domestic investors. The law reserves banking, insurance, microfinance, electricity transmission and distribution, and retail and wholesale trade for domestic investors. Foreign investors can jointly invest as minority stakeholders with domestic investors in areas such as freight forwarding and shipping, domestic air transportation services, cross-country public transport services, advertisement and promotion, and accounting and auditing services. For joint ventures with state-owned enterprises (SOEs), some investors report that the government informally encourages foreign investors to hire local labor and utilize domestic raw materials. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES Although the Government of Ethiopia has launched processes to fully or partially privatize some SOEs, most notably under the Homegrown Economic Reform Plan, SOEs continue to dominate major sectors of the economy. These include the telecommunications, power, banking, insurance, air transport, certain agricultural processing, industrial parks, and shipping industries. Many SOEs maintain a monopoly over their respective sectors, which allows the Government of Ethiopia to dictate prevailing rates for many goods and services. U.S. investors complain of the lack of a level playing field when it comes to SOEs. In 2019, the Government of Ethiopia passed a law that prohibits certain SOEs from accessing new loans and instructs them to focus on completing outstanding projects. SOEs, however, have considerable advantages over private firms, such as expedited customs clearance processing, priority access to financing and foreign currency from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, preferences in government tenders and land acquisition, and marketing assistance. In December 2021, the Government of Ethiopia established Ethiopian Investment Holdings, a sovereign wealth fund, to prepare over 40 SOEs for full or partial privatization. The Government of Ethiopia has offered to sell eight state-owned sugar enterprises and a 45 percent stake in Ethio Telecom to foreign bidders. Thus far, Ethiopia has failed to attract interest in the Ethio Telecom stake, closing auctions with no successful bidders in 2021, 2022, or 2023. Transport and logistics are predominantly conducted by SOEs in Ethiopia, and monopolistic market conditions in multimodal transport operations and inadequate infrastructure inhibit private sector logistics companies. Consequently, logistics costs comprise approximately 22 percent to 27 percent of final costs for many products and shipping and freight costs are approximately 60 percent higher than in neighboring countries. Under the framework of a comprehensive logistics strategy, the Government of Ethiopia has slated the logistics sector for liberalization, and Ethiopian Railways officials report the border crossing process between Ethiopia and Djibouti by train has been streamlined. On October 13, 2024, the Minister of Transport and Logistics proposed a policy allowing foreign investors to own 100 percent of logistics companies, an increase from the previous cap of 49 percent. The policy must be approved by the Council of Ministers. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-135-2048.jpg) ![128 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS OTHER BARRIERS Bribery and Corruption Ethiopian and foreign businesses routinely encounter corruption in tax collection, customs clearance, and land administration. Some U.S. businesses operating in Ethiopia reported that they were frequently solicited for bribes to secure business contracts. Tax administration in Ethiopia is corrupt and inefficient, and the Ethiopian Government supplements revenues by levying higher taxes on foreign investors and businesses and limiting their ability to appeal tax levies. U.S. and other foreign companies complain they are unfairly targeted for tax collection compared with local companies and are presented with spurious tax bills. In November 2022, the Government of Ethiopia recognized corruption as a threat to national security and an obstacle to doing business and formed a new National Anti-Corruption Committee led by the head of the National Intelligence and Security Service. Between June 2023 and June 2024, the Ministry of Justice Anti-Corruption Directorate prosecuted 186 cases, resulting in 164 convictions. Commercial Code Enforcement In 2021, Ethiopia reformed its Commercial Code for the first time in 62 years, aiming to bring its commercial law in line with international best practices and address business community concerns. Implementation of the new code across ministries is ongoing, which is expected to lessen the difficulty of doing business in Ethiopia by facilitating trade license registration and renewal, providing registration exemptions for some companies, and allowing new and different types of businesses to form and operate in Ethiopia. Some members of the business community have expressed concern about inconsistent enforcement of the new code. Foreign Currency Controls Foreign exchange shortages have been a significant barrier to business transactions, including trade transactions and remitting profits and dividends. In July 2024, Ethiopia shifted to a market-determined foreign exchange regime, moving from a fixed exchange rate to a floating exchange rate. The Government of Ethiopia expects the new foreign market to ease businesses’ access to foreign exchange. However, there are reports of foreign exchange shortages in the early stages of this market’s development. As a result, there has been difficulty in obtaining foreign currency, hampering manufacturers’ ability to import goods and repatriate profits, despite laws allowing investors to remit profits and dividends. Difficulty obtaining foreign currency for inputs and repatriating profits has been cited by U.S. companies as a major impediment to foreign investment. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) issued a Foreign Exchange Directive to a commercial bank in July 2024. All imports, exports, and outgoing foreign payments require a foreign exchange permit, which are to be provided by commercial banks. In July 2024, the NBE permitted exporters to retain 50 percent of their earnings in foreign currency while requiring the remaining 50 percent to be exchanged at a commercial bank in the equivalent amount of the national currency, Ethiopian birr. In November, 2024, the Ethiopian Government updated the guidance to permit exporters to retain 50 percent of the foreign currency they generate in their Ethiopian accounts for an independent period, while continuing to require them to surrender the remaining 50 percent to commercial banks. Additionally, in August 2024, Ethiopia allowed traders to import goods using the franco valuta, traders use their own foreign currency to pay import costs rather than purchasing foreign exchange from a bank. The NBE allowed traders under the franco valuta scheme to import all goods except fuel-powered vehicles, weapons, and security equipment. Ethiopia previously only allowed this mechanism for importing basic commodities such as edible oil, wheat flour, rice, and infant formula. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-136-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 129 EUROPEAN UNION OVERVIEW The United States and the Member States of the European Union (EU) share the largest economic relationship in the world. Trade and investment flows between the United States and the EU are a key pillar of prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic and generate substantial economic opportunities. Goods and services produced by the United States nonetheless face persistent barriers entering and maintaining access to certain sectors of the EU market, which limits the opportunity of U.S. workers and businesses to benefit from transatlantic trade. This chapter of the National Trade Estimate (NTE) Report highlights the most significant of these barriers, some of which have persisted despite repeated efforts at resolution through bilateral consultations, World Trade Organization (WTO) committee meetings, or WTO dispute settlement. Certain barriers have been highlighted in the annual NTE Report for many years. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs The EU’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 5.0 percent in 2023 (latest data available). The EU’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 10.8 percent for agricultural products and 4.1 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). The EU has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the WTO, with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 5.0 percent. Although the EU’s tariffs are generally low for non-agricultural goods, some EU tariffs are high, such as rates of up to 26 percent for fish and seafood, 22 percent for trucks, 14 percent for bicycles, 10 percent for passenger vehicles, and 6.5 percent for fertilizers and plastics. Meursing Table Tariff Codes Many processed food products, such as confectionary products, baked goods, and miscellaneous food preparations, are subject to a special tariff code system in the EU. Under this system, often referred to as the “Meursing” table, the EU charges a tariff on each imported product based on the product’s content of milk protein, milk fat, starch, and sugar. As a result, products that the United States and other countries might consider equivalent for tariff classification purposes sometimes receive different rates of duty in the EU depending on the particular composition of each product. The difficulty of calculating Meursing duties imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on, and creates uncertainty for exporters, especially those seeking to ship new products to the EU. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Licensing – Bananas Following years of disputes, beginning under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1947 (GATT 1947) and later under the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding, the United States and other countries in 2010 reached agreements with the EU to resolve complaints about successive EU banana import regimes. Beginning in 2013, a U.S. stakeholder expressed concerns to the U.S. Government about actions taken since 2010 by Italian customs authorities to collect retroactive payment of customs duties due to the authorities’ unilateral re-interpretation of the validity of certain EU banana import licenses under pre-2006 EU ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-137-2048.jpg) ![130 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS regulations. In 2017, the Italian Supreme Court, on jurisdictional grounds, ruled against the Italian Government and ordered authorities to repay the collected duties to the U.S. stakeholder. While the duties had been repaid to the stakeholder by December 31, 2024, Italian customs authorities continue to re-issue some of the previous retroactive duty assessments against the stakeholder. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Notwithstanding the existence of customs legislation that governs all Member States, the EU does not administer its laws through a single customs administration. Rather, there are separate agencies responsible for the administration of EU customs law in each Member State. It is thus difficult for the EU to ensure that its rules and decisions on classification, valuation, origin, and customs procedures are applied uniformly throughout the Member States, and U.S. exports suffer from the uneven and inconsistent application of these requirements. The Binding Tariff Information program provided for by EU-level law, but administered at the Member State level, does provide for advance rulings on tariff classification and country of origin. However, EU rules do not require the customs agency in one Member State to follow the decisions of the customs agency in another Member State with respect to materially identical issues. In some cases where the customs agency of a Member State administers EU law differently from, or disagrees with, the Binding Tariff Information issued by another Member State, the matter may be referred to the Customs Code Committee (CCC). The CCC consists of Member State representatives and is chaired by a European Commission representative. Although a stated goal for the CCC is to help reconcile differences among Member States and thereby help to achieve uniformity of administration, in practice its success in this regard has been limited. The CCC and other EU-level institutions do not provide transparency in decision-making or opportunities for participation by traders, which might make them more effective tools for achieving the uniform administration and application of EU customs law. In addition, the EU lacks tribunals or procedures for the prompt review and EU-wide correction of administrative actions relating to customs matters. Instead, review is provided in the tribunals of each Member State, and the rules regarding these reviews vary from Member State to Member State. A trader encountering differing treatment in multiple Member States must bring a separate appeal in each Member State whose agency rendered an adverse decision. Ultimately, a question of interpretation of EU law may be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Although the judgments of the CJEU apply throughout the EU, referral of a question to the CJEU is generally discretionary, may take many years, and may not afford sufficient redress. Thus, obtaining corrections with EU-wide effect for administrative actions relating to customs matters is frequently cumbersome and time-consuming. The United States has raised concerns regarding the lack of uniform administration of EU customs law with the EU in various forums, including in the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The European Commission has sought to modernize and simplify customs rules and processes. The Union Customs Code (UCC), adopted by the European Commission in 2013, entered into force in 2016. While the UCC contains a number of procedural changes, the key element of a harmonized information technology infrastructure has yet to be completed. Member States continue to use different data templates. In 2019, the expected completion date for full implementation of harmonized customs data systems was extended from the end of 2020 to the end of 2025. The European Commission plans to undertake comprehensive reform of the Customs Union beginning in 2028. The United States will continue to monitor the UCC implementation process, focusing on its impact on the consistency of customs treatment under EU customs law. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-138-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 131 TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Transparency and Notification U.S. exporters face a proliferation of technical barriers to trade (TBT) in the EU, attributable in part to aspects of the EU’s regulatory processes, which prescribe conditions for the consideration and adoption of regulations and related decisions without adequate notification or the opportunity to incorporate meaningful public comments from trading partners. The United States regularly raises concerns, both in bilateral engagement and in the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (WTO TBT Committee), that EU notifications often take place at a stage in the EU’s regulatory process when it is too late to revise the measure to take into consideration any substantive concerns raised by other WTO Members. Furthermore, notifications of proposed measures often lack specificity, or incorporate by reference the publication of future, European-unique standards that do not yet exist, so that non-European producers do not have a meaningful opportunity to engage or offer informed comments. For example, under the EU’s regulatory processes for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH, Regulation (EC) 1907/2006) and Classification, Labeling, and Packaging (CLP, Regulation (EC) 1272/2008), proposed restrictions are typically notified to the WTO only after scientific review and regulatory impact committees have convened and the European Commission’s domestic consultations have concluded. These domestic consultations are not always transparent to non- EU stakeholders, which can limit their ability to provide comment and for those comments to be taken into consideration. In other cases, measures undergo significant changes during the negotiations among the Council of the European Union (European Council), European Commission, and European Parliament, absent additional consultations with stakeholders, notifications, or impact assessments. Finally, failure to notify measures with adequate comment periods is also observed at the Member State level, including in the case of recent Irish alcohol labeling regulations. Improvement and greater consistency in EU and Member State notification of measures could benefit U.S. exports by contributing to a more predictable market environment. European Standardization and Conformity Assessment Procedures The EU’s exclusionary approach to standards-related measures, including its conformity assessment framework, and its efforts to encourage governments around the world to adopt its restrictive approach, imposes significant burdens on U.S. workers and exporters. In particular, the EU’s approach impedes market access for products that do not conform to European regional standards (ENs), including products that comply with international standards that are not harmonized with ENs, even though these international standards may meet or exceed the EU regulatory requirements. Products regulated by the EU must conform to these EU-specific regional standards in order to benefit from a “presumption of conformity” with the EU’s essential regulatory requirements. U.S. workers and exporters thus face additional burdens in accessing the EU market not faced by domestic producers in the EU and often not faced by EU exporters when accessing the U.S. market. ENs can only be developed through three European Standards Organizations (ESOs), as directed by the European Commission through a standardization request. The three ESOs are the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Within these designated ESOs, the CEN and CENELEC technical committees draft harmonized ENs. Both generally exclude non-EU nationals ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-139-2048.jpg) ![132 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS from participating in their standard-drafting process. In the limited instances where non-EU nationals do participate, they are not allowed to vote. On February 2, 2022, the EU published the European Standardization Strategy, which, inter alia, amends Regulation (EU) 1025/2012 on European Standardization Organizations to require that the ESOs restrict the involvement of non-EU interests in the development of harmonized EN standards. The change primarily affects the development of standards at the ETSI, which specializes in information and communications technologies and had been the only ESO to provide for direct participation by foreign firms. In addition, new policies implemented by the European Commission, such as a refusal to reference underlying standards developed outside of Europe and new restrictions imposed on participation in expert advisory groups (including the newly created High Level Forum on European Standardization), suggest a sustained effort to exclude foreign participants, undermine the acceptance of international standards developed in the United States, and project European regional standards abroad. The United States is concerned that the European Standardization Strategy and other exclusionary steps indicate that the EU is moving further away from cooperation with trading partners in standardization, and barriers in the transatlantic market will thus be exacerbated rather than ameliorated. The United States has relayed its concerns to the EU through the United States–European Union Trade and Technology Council, as well as through comments in response to an EU public consultation on the functioning of Regulation (EU) 1025/2012, submitted on July 24, 2024. As part of its free trade agreements, the EU seeks commitments affirming that only a standard issued by a subset of specific standards-developing organizations, none of which are domiciled in the United States, be considered an “international standard” (e.g., the EU–Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, Article 7.6). This practice accords preferential treatment to organizations in which the EU carries an outsized influence (e.g., the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) or with which the ESOs have existing cooperation agreements (e.g., the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission). This approach is narrower than what is provided for under the WTO TBT Agreement and related decisions of the WTO TBT Committee, which recognize “international standards” as those developed in accordance with certain principles, and without reference to particular institutions or methods of organization. The United States also has serious concerns regarding the EU’s conformity assessment framework, set out in Regulation (EC) 765/2008 and Decision 768/2008/EC. Regulation (EC) 765/2008 requires each Member State to appoint a single national accreditation body that can accredit conformity assessment bodies and prohibits competition among Member States’ national accreditation bodies. Further, the EU’s interpretation of Decision 768/2008/EC sets out that conformity assessment bodies must be located in the EU in order to test to EU regulations. This geographic restriction denies U.S.-domiciled conformity assessment bodies the opportunity to certify products for the EU market outside of existing mutual recognition agreements. It also raises significant market access concerns for U.S. producers whose products have been tested or certified by conformity assessment bodies located outside the EU. Without any associated improvement in quality or safety, the EU conformity assessment approach increases time to market and raises costs for U.S. exporters. Chemical Regulations The EU’s framework for chemicals policy continues to present a number of significant barriers for U.S. exporters. Stakeholders have raised concerns that, as part of the registration process under REACH, they must provide data that is not relevant to the specific hazards and proposed uses of a registered substance. Amendments to the classification of chemicals under the CLP often appear driven by a process that does not allow adequate time for stakeholder comment, even when the proposed changes differ significantly ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-140-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 133 from the globally harmonized classifications followed by U.S. industry and other economies. As with other sectors, the United States is also concerned that the EU’s reliance on a “precautionary” or “hazard-based” approach to regulation of products can result in severe limitations on the use of products without a basis in scientific assessment of the actual risks of exposure in a specific use. Additionally, Member States’ application of REACH appears to be inconsistent and lack transparency, which can result in requirements that are more onerous for U.S. exporters than they are for EU businesses and products that are already in the EU market. Classification, Labeling, and Packaging Hazard Classes The United States has voiced concerns regarding the European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/707 of December 19, 2022 (amending Regulation (EC) 1272/2008) regarding hazard classes and criteria for the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures, noting that the new CLP classification and labeling requirements will diverge from the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). The United States has encouraged the EU not to preempt a scientific review by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of new labeling requirements and to remain harmonized with the GHS. Delegated Regulation 2023/707 entered into force on April 20, 2023. The EU released guidance on these new classification and labeling requirements in November 2024, with the new requirements going into effect in May 2025 for new substances and November 2026 for substances already on the market. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances On February 7, 2023, the European Chemicals Agency published a proposed restriction that would largely eliminate the production and use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The United States is concerned that the EU proposal does not consider the different impacts on various PFAS chemicals, nor the implications of the ban for several critical uses, such as in the production of some renewable energy products, as well as other manufactured goods such as semiconductors and medical devices, for which there are, as yet, no feasible alternatives to PFAS. Additionally, the proposal could impact the implementation of global treaties to reduce ozone depletion, such as the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, by restricting alternatives to existing substances. The United States continues to raise these concerns bilaterally, including at WTO TBT Committee meetings. Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases In February 2024, the EU adopted an update to the 2014 Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas (F-Gas) Regulation, (EU) 2024/573 that will accelerate the phase-out of many technologies that use F-gases. The Regulation included restrictions on certain uses of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), even though these gases are not restricted via the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The EU’s decision was taken without consideration of viable technological and commercially available alternatives. The United States further expressed concerns that the restriction of low GWP HFOs under the F-gas Regulation was premature and possibly duplicative of the EU’s proposed PFAS restriction via REACH. The United States repeatedly raised concerns regarding the EU’s approach both bilaterally and at the WTO TBT Committee, and continues to monitor implementation of the measure, as it may have significant implications for U.S. exporters. (Additional concerns with the EU policies in regard to F-Gas are discussed in the Other Barriers section of this NTE Report chapter.) ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-141-2048.jpg) ![134 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Packaging and Packing Waste Regulation On January 22, 2025, the EU published Regulation (EU) 2025/40 on packaging and packaging waste to replace an existing directive and regulation in an effort to harmonize Member State packaging and packaging waste regulations. The regulation entered into force on February 11, 2025, and generally applies from August 12, 2026. The regulation requires a minimum recycled content in plastic packaging and requires that recycled content recovered from post-consumer plastic waste comply with strict sustainability requirements if recycled in the EU. For plastic content recycled in a third country, recycling operators/installations need to follow the same sustainability criteria as in the EU. The European Union has a deadline of January 1, 2026 to establish a methodology for certifying the equivalence of the rules in third countries. The United States will continue to engage the EU as the legislation is implemented to ensure implementing acts are developed in a manner that does not create unjustified barriers to U.S. exports, to ensure that it provides harmonized rules across Member States, and to seek clarification necessary to help stakeholders comply with the requirements. The United States continues to engage the EU as the legislation progresses, including through the WTO TBT Committee, especially with regard to the proposed mirror clauses regarding recycled plastic packaging for food contact applications and recycling installations sustainability, which would require U.S. competent authorities to verify that U.S. recycling facilities comply with EU regional standards. Deforestation-Free Supply Chain Regulation On June 29, 2023, the EU issued a deforestation-free supply chain regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115), with an initial 18-month transition period through December 30, 2024. The regulation aims to curb deforestation and forest degradation linked to European consumption and production of beef, coffee, cocoa, palm oil, soy, wood, rubber, and their derived products (e.g., charcoal, furniture, tires, paper, leather), with potential expansion to other products and ecosystems. U.S. agricultural and commodity stakeholders have raised concerns that due diligence and traceability requirements in the regulation may not be possible for U.S. companies to meet. To date, the EU has refused to notify the regulation to WTO Members or to provide an opportunity for WTO Members and other stakeholders to comment on the regulation. The United States and 17 other WTO Members raised concerns with the regulation at the November 2024 WTO TBT Committee meeting. The United States continues to seek WTO notification of the measure and to engage the EU on its implementation. In 2023, U.S. exports of products covered by the EU’s deforestation- free regulation exceeded $8 billion (latest data available). Many U.S. stakeholders had argued that the transition period through December 30, 2024 was insufficient time for compliance. On December 19, 2024, the EU issued Regulation (EU) 2024/3234 delaying implementation by 12 months (to December 30, 2025) for large and medium companies and 18 months (to June 30, 2026) for micro and small companies to give operators and competent authorities additional time to prepare. The Commission also published long-awaited guidance documents and new FAQs to support operators’ compliance preparations, as well as some details of the methodology for determining country risk benchmarking levels. Additionally, the Commission announced the country benchmarking system will be finalized through a proposed implementing act by June 30, 2025. The United States will continue to engage with the EU regarding implementation and enforcement of the regulation to ensure that U.S. exports will not be disadvantaged. Eco-design for Sustainable Products Regulation and the Digital Product Passport On July 18, 2024, the Eco-design for Sustainable Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2024/1781) entered into force. The regulation establishes an eco-design framework for sustainable products that will require industry to meet new sustainability requirements. Articles 7 through 15 of the regulation require industry to develop and implement a new digital label (known as a Digital Product Passport or DPP) to ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-142-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 135 trace lifecycle information and other aspects of a product in order to inform consumers and help public authorities to better perform checks and controls. Some U.S. stakeholders are concerned that the DPP requirements set unrealistic implementation timelines and do not include sufficient safeguards to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential business information. The United States made multiple requests to the EU to notify the measure to the WTO to allow trading partners the opportunity to provide feedback. To date, the EU has refused to notify the measure. Green Claims Directive On March 22, 2023, the European Commission released the proposal for a directive on substantiation and communication of explicit environmental claims (“Green Claims Directive,” notified to the WTO in May 2023) to combat misleading environmental claims (“greenwashing”). The United States has been engaging with the European Commission to ensure that the directive is clear and specific as to the elements needed to substantiate environmental claims, including documentation requirements and implementation periods for the measure’s conformity assessment procedures and labeling requirements related to product characteristics. The United States has also been seeking to collaborate with the EU to achieve greater alignment on the recognition of eco-label schemes and measures to combat greenwashing. (Sanitary and phytosanitary concerns with the European Green Deal are discussed in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers section of this NTE Report chapter.) Renewable Energy Directive The EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) ((EC) 2009/28) requires that biofuels and biofuel feedstocks obtain a “Proof of Sustainability” certification to qualify for tax incentives and national use targets. RED also establishes a methodology and accounting system by which Member States may record and calculate required greenhouse gas emission savings as compared to a baseline for fossil fuels. In 2018, the European Commission adopted a new Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) for the period 2021 to 2030. RED II entered into force on January 1, 2021 and introduced sustainability requirements for forestry biomass (wood pellets). The European Commission began revisions of RED II in 2022, and the final revisions were published on October 31, 2023. The revisions to RED II increased the EU’s binding renewable target for 2030 to a minimum of 42.5 percent, up from the prior 32 percent target. However, the sustainability criteria for biofuels and biomass were not fundamentally changed, which may limit U.S. exports of biofuels and biomass that would otherwise provide viable renewable sources for the EU’s renewable energy targets. The United States exported approximately $272 million in wood pellets and $440 million in bioethanol to the EU in 2024. Pesticide Maximum Residue Limits for Environmental Objectives On February 15, 2023, the EU published Commission Regulation (EU) 2023/334 to reduce maximum residue limits (MRLs) for clothianidin and thiamethoxam to the limit of determination, in an effort to protect pollinators, particularly bees, in countries outside of the EU. The measure would effectively bar all imports of products to the EU that contain any detectable residue of the two widely used pesticides after March 7, 2026. The United States shares the EU’s concerns about pollinator health and is actively working to protect bees and other pollinators in the United States. However, the global scientific and regulatory community has found that complex interactions among multiple factors affect pollinator health, including the health of bees, and that the safe use of the two pesticides may be determined based on local, national, or regional contexts by the appropriate competent authorities. The United States has also raised concerns with the EU ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-143-2048.jpg) ![136 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS that the use of MRLs as an environmental safety management tool could undermine the development and use of international standards for food safety. Given the critical importance of the pesticides identified in the regulation, the measure appears to pose a significant obstacle to international trade and production of agricultural products. The European Commission intends to consider additional substances under a similar approach. In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the United States raised this issue with the EU at the WTO TBT Committee, WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (WTO SPS Committee), and WTO Council for Trade in Goods. The United States continues to encourage the EU to pursue a collaborative approach to protect pollinators worldwide. (Other MRL concerns with the European Union are discussed in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers section of this NTE Report chapter.) Medical Devices and In-Vitro Diagnostics Regulation The United States continues to be concerned about the implementation of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the In-Vitro Medical Device Regulation (IVDR), especially the shortage of notified bodies available to assess medical devices and in-vitro medical devices. The ongoing lack of capacity to conduct conformity assessment has led to longer review times, and it remains difficult for some companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to obtain access to reviews. The lengthy review times and lack of access impact the ability of companies to keep legacy devices on the EU market and to bring new devices to healthcare providers and patients. The United States has repeatedly engaged the EU through the WTO TBT Committee and bilateral discussions around those meetings to seek updates on the implementation of the MDR and IVDR, including the number of qualified notified bodies to perform conformity assessment requirements. On March 20, 2023, Regulation (EU) 2023/607 amending the MDR and IVDR took effect, allowing for staggered and conditional extension of a transition period to the new rules until 2027 or 2028, according to the risk class of the devices. On July 9, 2024, the EU published Regulation (EU) 2024/1860 amending Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746 regarding a gradual roll-out of the European database for medical devices called Eudamed, which includes an extension to the transitional period for certain in-vitro diagnostics and introduces notification obligations for interruptions in supply. Wine Labeling In May 2023, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/2117, which introduced a compulsory nutrition declaration and list of ingredients to be displayed on the label of wine products sold on the EU market beginning December 8, 2023. The regulation permits producers to provide mandatory lists of ingredients and nutritional information, excluding allergens and energy content, via an electronic label accessed through a quick-response (QR) code on the physical label. U.S. industry supports the use of electronic labels to provide additional information for consumers; however, U.S. industry has reported that several Member States have different interpretations of EU guidance published in 2023, specifically, on the text accompanying the QR code. The United States raised this issue with the EU bilaterally as part of the United States-European Union Wine Dialogue and at the March and June 2024 WTO TBT Committee meetings. U.S. industry has raised concerns that differing Member States requirements regarding the word or words that must accompany QR codes may be contrary to the nature of the EU as a single market. In 2024, the United States exported more than $170 million of wine to the EU. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-144-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 137 Traditional Terms on Wine The EU continues to restrict the use of “traditional terms,” such as “tawny,” “ruby,” and “chateau,” on labels on imported wine. This impedes U.S. wine exports to the EU, including U.S. wines that include these traditional terms as part of their trademarks. U.S. wines sold under a trademark that includes one of the traditional terms can only be marketed in the EU if the trademark was registered before May 2002. The EU has not taken any visible steps to address the concerns of the United States and has consistently refused to provide a timeline for review of the applications for the use of terms submitted by U.S. industry. Alcohol Labeling In May 2023, Ireland introduced a Public Health (Alcohol) (Labelling) regulation, which sets unique health labeling requirements for alcohol being sold in the Irish market. The regulation mandates that all alcohol beverages display warnings on product packaging informing consumers about the risk of consuming alcohol when pregnant and the risk of liver disease and fatal cancers from alcohol consumption. U.S. industry has raised concerns that unique labeling requirements for the Irish market, which are in addition to the EU-wide regulations already adhered to by U.S. industry, would be costly and may disrupt U.S. exports within the EU single market. In March 2024, the United States raised procedural concerns about the regulation in the WTO TBT Committee meeting and questioned how Ireland’s labeling regime would be reconciled with future EU-wide requirements on health and warning labeling. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers The United States remains concerned about a number of measures the EU maintains ostensibly for the purposes of food safety and protecting human, animal, or plant life or health. Specifically, the United States is concerned that these measures may unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering safety objectives, because they appear to be applied beyond the extent necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, not based on science, or maintained without sufficient scientific evidence. Farm to Fork Strategy To achieve the targets of the European Green Deal, described in the Technical Barriers to Trade section of this Chapter, and the related Farm to Fork (F2F) Strategy introduced in May 2020, the EU has adopted multiple regulations that may inappropriately use food safety standards as the basis for sustainability requirements. Among other things, these targets aim to reduce the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and antimicrobials in agricultural production, to achieve the EU’s goal of enhanced food and agricultural sustainability by 2030. The EU has also stated it will seek to “obtain ambitious commitments from third countries in key areas,” and is increasingly attempting to expand the reach of this policy beyond the EU. Many of the targets were converted into legislative proposals, and the European Parliament and European Council shaped and amended these proposals as part of the EU legislative process that occurred between 2021 and 2024. It remains to be seen how the EU will implement the broader objectives of the F2F Strategy through these interrelated initiatives, which appear to blend SPS issues with potential TBT requirements like labeling or certification schemes. U.S. stakeholders are concerned that EU implementing regulations may focus on promoting EU production practices that are not appropriate, effective, or efficient in other parts of the world and, if required, could unnecessarily restrict trade or require farmers in the United States and other countries outside the EU to produce crops in less sustainable ways than they otherwise would have, as a precondition for gaining access to the EU market. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-145-2048.jpg) ![138 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Hormones and Beta-Agonists Despite scientific evidence that such meat is safe for consumers, the EU maintains various measures that impose bans and restrictions on meat produced using hormones, beta agonists, and other growth promotants approved for use in the United States. U.S. producers cannot export meat or meat products to the EU unless they participate in a costly and burdensome verification program to ensure that hormones, beta agonists, or other growth promotants have not been used in their production. For example, the EU continues to ban the use of the beta agonist ractopamine, which promotes leanness and enhances feed utilization by animals raised for meat. The EU maintains this ban even though international standards promulgated by Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) have established maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the safe trade in products produced with ractopamine. The Codex MRL was established following a scientific study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives that found ractopamine at the specified MRL does not have an adverse impact on human health. In 2019, as part of a compromise solution to the U.S.–EU hormone beef WTO dispute, the United States and the EU concluded an agreement that established a duty-free tariff-rate quota (TRQ) for the United States. The agreement went into effect on January 1, 2020, and provided American ranchers an initial TRQ of 18,500 metric tons annually, valued at approximately $220 million. The TRQ increases annually over a period of seven years, and will reach 35,000 metric tons in 2026, valued at approximately $420 million. U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns about the requirements of the EU’s residue monitoring program for animal products, and U.S. competent authorities continue to work with their counterparts in the EU to ensure that all requirements are justified based on science and risk and least trade restrictive. Antimicrobial Resistance and the Restrictions on the Use of Veterinary Medicinal Products In December 2018, the EU published Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products that seeks to address antimicrobial resistance by more strictly defining the criteria for use of antimicrobial products in animal medicine. Regulation (EU) 2019/6 also identifies a list of products that will be exclusively reserved for human medicine and no longer permitted in agricultural production. Article 118 of the regulation expands these restrictions to operators in third countries, who will be required to ensure that animal products exported to the EU and intended for human consumption do not originate from animals that have been treated with specified antimicrobial medicines reserved for human use or utilized for growth promotion. The official implementation date for Regulation (EU) 2019/6 and related implementing measures is September 3, 2026. In February 2024, the EU published Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/399, which amended model health certificates for entry into the European Union of consignments of certain products of animal origin and certain categories of animals. The amended model health certificates will be utilized by exporting countries. On June 28, 2024, the EU notified to the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (G/SPS/N/EU/778), which included publication of a list of third countries authorized for the entry into the EU of animals and products of animal origin intended for human consumption. Beginning September 3, 2024, two additional animal health attestations are required to be listed on official health certificates but exporting countries will not be required to make the attestations until the regulation is implemented on September 3, 2026. U.S. stakeholders are concerned about the potential impacts of these EU measures, in particular the attestation requirements on U.S. exports of animal products to the EU once the measures enter into force. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-146-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 139 U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns about other provisions that are not based on science or risk and instead promote the adoption of EU practices by third countries rather than recognizing the alternative ways that different competent authorities can arrive at the same level of product safety. U.S. stakeholders are also concerned about the EU’s prohibition on the use of non-medically important antimicrobials to promote growth and increase yield, as this prohibition does not appear to have a scientific justification and specific food safety concerns have not been identified. The United States will continue to engage the EU regarding management of antimicrobial resistance and encourage science-based approaches. Agricultural Biotechnology Decades of data and experience demonstrate the safety of genetically engineered (GE) crops, in addition to the benefits of their use in reducing pesticide use and impact on non-target organisms, while increasing soil health, crop yields, and farmers’ incomes. Despite these benefits, the lack of predictability, excessive data requirements, and delays in the EU’s approval process for GE crops have prevented products from being exported to the EU, even though these products have been approved and grown safely in the United States and in other countries for many years. The United States continues to reiterate concerns with delays in the EU’s biotechnology approval procedures under the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Directive ((EC) 2001/18) and to engage the EU in efforts to normalize trade in these products, including through semiannual consultations in accordance with the 2008 decision by the United States and the EU to suspend Article 22.6 arbitration proceedings associated with the WTO dispute settlement proceeding against the European Communities (the EU predecessor entity) regarding the approval of biotechnology products. In 2024, the EU issued five approvals and five renewals for GE crops, compared to eight approvals and five renewals in 2023. While these new authorizations are welcomed, the EU’s average approval time for new GE crops in 2023 was approximately four years. In contrast, the EU’s own legally prescribed approval time for such products is 12 months (6 months for the review with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and 6 months for the political committee process known as comitology). As of December 31, 2024, the United States was tracking approximately 30 agricultural biotechnology product applications (including renewals) submitted to the EU, including with respect to corn, soybean, rapeseed, and cotton. Of those applications, 29 were under scientific review by the EFSA and 6 await action by the European Commission through comitology. Delays in both of these stages contribute to increasingly lengthy EU approval timelines. For example, EFSA continues to demand unnecessary studies while conducting risk assessments, which result in unpredictable delays in issuing final opinions. In comitology, repeated findings of “no opinion” by the relevant Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed also delay the EU from making decisions on GE approvals, by requiring products to go through an additional assessment by an Appeal Committee before receiving a final approval. The United States continues to engage the EU on delays of this nature and urge the EU to address other barriers to trade in biotechnology products. For example, the EU has yet to establish a practical low-level presence policy and instead maintains a 0.1 percent limit for unapproved biotechnology traits in feed shipments, which is not commercially feasible and disrupts trade in products that have otherwise passed U.S. safety assessments. Following two years of consultations and evaluations, the European Commission introduced its proposal for regulating plants derived from new genomic techniques on July 5, 2023. While the proposal received a favorable vote from the European Parliament on February 7, 2024, it still requires consensus from the Council of the European Union in order for the proposal to proceed in the legislative process. Until then, genome-edited products in the EU will continue to be regulated under the GMO Directive, regardless of their risk levels. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-147-2048.jpg) ![140 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Member State Measures on Agriculture Biotechnology In March 2015, the EU adopted a directive allowing Member States to prohibit the cultivation of GE plants in their respective territories for non-scientific reasons (Directive (EU) 2015/412). Under the transitional measures, Member States had until October 2015 to request exemption from the geographical scope of the authorizations already granted or that were under regulatory review for EU cultivation approval. Eighteen Member States “opted-out” of GE crop cultivation for all or part of their territories, and none of the five Member States (the Czech Republic, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain) that grew GE corn opted out. However, as of 2024, only Portugal and Spain commercially cultivated GE corn. Seventeen Member States have opted out of cultivation using biotechnology seeds. The 17 Member States that requested exclusion of their entire territory from the geographical scope of biotechnology applications are Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovenia. Additionally, one region in Belgium, Wallonia, has also opted out of cultivation. All of these Member States and regions have decided to prohibit the cultivation of Monsanto 810 corn (MON810) and the seven varieties of corn that were submitted for EU-wide approval in 2015 (apart from Denmark and Luxembourg, which have only prohibited MON810 and three of the seven varieties of corn that were submitted for EU-wide approval). EU Fumigation Requirements for Hardwood Lumber and Logs The EU previously prohibited the use of methyl bromide to fumigate logs and wood chips imports. Fumigation with sulfuryl fluoride is considered an equally effective substitute and is used throughout the EU, including for EU log exports. While the EU approved the use of sulfuryl fluoride for certain U.S. log exports in 2023, the decision on its use for U.S. pine wood chips remains pending scientific review, which leaves U.S. exporters of pine wood chips without a commercially viable fumigation option. Heat treatment, which is the EU alternative to fumigation, is not scalable in many instances. The United States will continue to engage with the EU on this issue to identify a path forward. Pathogen Reduction Treatments The EU maintains measures that prohibit the use of any substance other than water to remove contamination from animal products unless the substance has been approved by the European Commission. These measures significantly affect U.S. exports of beef, pork, and poultry to the EU because the European Commission has failed to approve several pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs) that have been approved for use in the United States. PRTs are rinses used to kill microbial pathogens that commonly exist on meat after slaughter. The PRTs at issue have been approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) after establishing their safety on the basis of scientific evidence. In March 2017, the National Pork Producers Council submitted an application to the European Commission for the approval of two organic acids, lactic and acetic, for use on pork. The application was submitted to EFSA by the European Commission in September 2017. EFSA published its evaluation in December 2018, confirming the safety of the use of acetic acid and lactic acid in pork processing. As of December 31, 2024, the European Commission has taken no action for the approval of pork PRTs. The United States maintains that the use of PRTs is a critical tool during meat processing that helps further the safety of products being placed on the market. The United States has engaged the EU to share scientific data regarding the safe use of PRTs and will continue to engage the EU regarding the approval of PRTs for beef, pork, and poultry as an effective tool to improve food safety. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-148-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 141 Certification Requirements Since January 2022, the EU has published at least fourteen versions of the health certificate it requires for U.S. agricultural exports of fish, meat, dairy, eggs, processed products, and animal byproducts. U.S. exporters are concerned about exporting products of animal and animal origin to the EU market and to third country markets that require transit through the EU because of the unpredictability of health certificate requirements. Differing interpretations of requirements among Member States adds to this uncertainty. The EU is currently contemplating the addition of attestations related to animal welfare, which may further complicate this issue. The EU has not provided scientific evidence to justify its certification requirements and subsequent modifications. The certification requirements also are enforced irrespective of whether these goods are destined for commercial sale in the EU or transiting through the EU. The EU’s requirements often appear to have been established without scientific evidence, a risk assessment, or consideration of Codex guidance on certifications, the latter of which recommend that official certificates require only the minimum amount of information necessary to meet the objectives of the country’s food safety system. Moreover, the EU’s changes to certificates are increasingly frequent, complex, and instituted through updates to multiple EU implementing or delegated regulations, making compliance difficult for manufacturers, exporters, foreign competent authorities, and EU importers. Certificates based on the standardized templates published in EU regulations are a condition for trade, but it is increasingly difficult for U.S. regulators to issue the required EU certificates. Differences in interpretation of EU legislation by Member State authorities also create legal uncertainty and often result in trade disruptions, creating additional burden for U.S. exporters. On September 15, 2022, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2022/1616 on recycled plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foods, which entered into force on October 10, 2024. Article 27 of the regulation requires the competent authority in the country where a recycler of food-contact plastic is located to verify that the recycler’s food safety controls are in compliance with EU requirements and to perform facility audits. Article 27 of the regulation also requires that the competent authority receive from the recycler a compliance monitoring summary sheet and verify that the information complies with EU regulations. The EU has rejected existing risk management systems implemented by component authorities in exporting countries, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s “No Objection Letter,” as potentially trade-facilitative alternatives. This regulation raises concerns with the jurisdictional precedence of an EU requirement to be verified by a non-EU competent authority and the lack of third-party conformity assessment options. The United States will continue to engage the EU bilaterally to resolve concerns regarding the EU’s certification requirements. Titanium Dioxide In November 2021, the European Commission published European Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/2090 in the EU Official Journal denying the authorization of titanium dioxide (E171) as a feed additive for all animal species. Following this action, Regulation (EU) 2022/63 prohibited titanium dioxide (E171) as a food additive in the EU as of August 7, 2022. The regulation includes a commitment to review the necessity to maintain or delete titanium dioxide from the EU list of food additives for exclusive use as a color in medicinal products. The European Commission originally tasked the European Medicines Agency (EMA) with reviewing the situation by April 2024, although the results of the review are still not publicly available. The regulation calls on the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate research and development for alternatives to titanium dioxide in both new and previously authorized products. The EMA published information in 2022 on the replacement and removal of titanium dioxide in medicines for pharmaceutical companies and is monitoring industry efforts. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-149-2048.jpg) ![142 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Animal Byproducts, Including Tallow The EU considers all animal byproducts sourced from animals raised under conditions not essentially identical to those in the EU to be hazardous materials. Since 2002, the EU has made modifications to its regulations and implementation practices governing animal byproducts that have resulted in the treatment of U.S. products being considered hazardous. The current EU interpretation of the animal byproducts regulations prevents most exports of U.S. animal byproducts, and several Member State border inspection posts have blocked consignments of various technical blood products. The United States has requested that tallow be allowed entry into the EU for any purpose without verification other than that the tallow and derivatives made from the tallow contain no more than a maximum level of insoluble impurities consistent with the internationally recognized standard for trade in tallow and with World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) recommendations but, to date, the EU has maintained its regulatory approach. Live Cattle Live cattle from the United States are not authorized to be exported to the EU, or transited through the EU en route to third countries, due to EU certification requirements for several bovine diseases. U.S. exports remain blocked because the United States and EU have not agreed on the conditions and format for an export certificate. The EU implemented new animal health laws in 2021, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) continues to explore alternative solutions, particularly with regard to a mutually acceptable animal health certificate, to resolve the issue of market access to the EU for live cattle. Trade in Raw and Processed Shellfish In February 2022, the EU determined the U.S. food safety system for raw bivalve mollusks (shellfish) to be equivalent to the EU’s food safety system for these products. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found two EU Member States to be operating a food safety system for shellfish to be equivalent to the U.S. food safety system. Trade was reopened for two U.S. states (Massachusetts and Washington) and opened for two EU Member States (Spain and the Netherlands), with an agreed mechanism for expediting the consideration of additional U.S. states and EU Member States. In April 2022, the United States sent dossiers for Connecticut, Maine, and Rhode Island seeking to export raw product to the EU. Although the EU committed to expedited reviews of U.S. state dossiers, as of December 31, 2024, the EU has not granted market access despite completing review of the dossiers of Connecticut and Maine. The EU has not provided a rationale for these delays and has not begun its review of the Rhode Island dossier. Processed shellfish from the United States is not currently authorized to be exported to the EU. The EU requires a determination of equivalence for processed shellfish, a level of control for a processed product that has not been supported by science-based risk assessment. The European Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) conducted an audit in November 2022, to evaluate whether U.S. controls to deliver and certify processed bivalve shellfish were compliant with U.S. food safety requirements and regulations. Following the audit, the U.S. FDA and U.S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) identified sections of the audit report that were incorrect or inaccurate and required editing to reflect a correct understanding of the U.S. national control system for processed bivalve shellfish. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), FDA, and NOAA continue to engage with DG SANTE in order to make progress on this issue. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-150-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 143 Specified Risk Materials Certification Requirement The EU has a different definition of specified risk materials (SRM) from the United States for the animal tissues most at risk of harboring the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (BSE). The EU requires that materials exported to the EU meet the EU’s SRM definition and be derived from carcasses of animals that can be confirmed as never having been outside of regions that the EU considers to be of negligible risk for BSE. Although WOAH has recognized the United States as having negligible risk, the source cattle for U.S. ruminant origin animal byproduct exports may not necessarily come from negligible risk countries. The EU SRM requirement unnecessarily impedes U.S. exports of ruminant origin animal byproducts considered safe in the United States and would potentially limit the market for ovine/caprine byproducts were other market impediments removed. The SRM requirement otherwise has not been an issue for bovine meat for human consumption, because the special EU-required production controls in the non-hormone-treated cattle program already provide the necessary verifications regarding the history of the animal. The EU’s “born and raised” BSE requirement is based on its non-recognition of WOAH animal disease status for the United States and is related to animal health versus the origin of the products. Consistent with the recommendations of WOAH, it is the BSE status of the country of export that should determine whether SRMs have to be removed. The United States continues to raise this issue in appropriate fora, including bilateral technical working groups, and has requested the removal of the EU’s requirement for all relevant U.S. commodities. Hazard-based Cutoff Criteria for Agricultural Chemicals Active substances can only be approved for use in crop protection products in the EU if they fulfill the approval criteria established in Regulation (EC) 1107/2009. Under this regulation, the EU’s determination includes hazard-based “cutoff” criteria that exclude certain categories of products from consideration for normal authorization for use in the EU. In instances where an active substance triggers the cut-off criteria, the EU regulatory process allows for an active substance to remain unapproved, regardless of risk of exposure. For such products, the EU does not complete a risk assessment. Rather, the EU discontinues authorization for a particular product at the time of re-approval, as has happened for an increasing number of substances. The EU has also been taking a “hazard-based approach” to new products, declaring them to be ineligible for authorization based solely on the intrinsic properties of the product, without taking important risk factors such as level of exposure or dosage into account. The United States is concerned that an increasing number of safe and widely-used substances are not being reapproved or having reasonable import tolerances set for their use, due to these arbitrary cut-off criteria when current registrations expire. Categorization of Compounds as Endocrine Disruptors One category of crop protection products subject to the hazard-based approach set out in Regulation (EC) 1107/2009 are substances classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs). EDs are naturally occurring or man- made substances that may mimic or interfere with hormone functions. The United States evaluates possible endocrine effects associated with the use of certain chemicals to ensure protection of public health and the environment. In contrast, the EU established an approach to regulating these compounds that appears not to be based on scientific principles or is maintained without scientific evidence. The scope of trade effects of Regulation (EC) 1107/2009 is broad and overlaps with that of the other hazard criteria and environmental criteria the EU uses in regulating pesticides. The EU obscures its hazard-based decisions with onerous data requirements that allow the European Commission to claim an inability to measure risk. The United States continues to monitor this issue and raise concerns in international and bilateral fora. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-151-2048.jpg) ![144 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Pesticide Maximum Residue Limits Maximum residue limits and import tolerances are established under legislation, Regulation (EC) 396/2005, which, unlike Regulation (EC) 1107/2009, is risk-based rather than hazard-based. However, for active substances that are not approved due to the EU’s cut-off criteria under Regulation (EC) 1107/2009, the EU may withdraw MRLs established under Regulation (EC) 396/2005, and reduce import tolerances to the default level of 0.01 mg/kg. The EU conducted an evaluation of existing legislation on plant protection products and pesticide residues through the Regulatory Fitness and Performance process. At this time, the EU has no intention to further align Regulation (EC) 396/2005 with the hazard-based principles of Regulation (EC) 1107/2009. As the number of substances ineligible for reauthorization by the EU increases, and as the EU reduces the corresponding MRLs and import tolerances to the default level, the significant negative effect on agricultural production and trade is likely to increase. The EU regulations also establish transitional periods to allow producers to adjust to changes in EU MRLs, although the transition periods established by the EU are generally not long enough to avoid trade disruption. For many products, there may be a gap of several years between pesticide application and when a final product is offered for sale, creating a situation where products that are compliant with EU MRLs at the time of production do not have time to clear the channels of trade. EU products, on the other hand, appear to remain available for sale as long as they are produced prior to MRLs changing. The United States has raised concerns over the EU’s policy approaches for years and continues to engage on these issues in the WTO SPS Committee. The United States is also monitoring the EU’s actions with regard to evaluating and establishing import tolerances for active substances, which have the potential to create further trade disruptions when MRLs are set at levels that are lower than necessary to protect human health and are unnecessarily burdensome for trade. Glyphosate Renewal The EU requires that the approval of the active substance of a pesticide (i.e., the substance that works against pests or plant diseases) be periodically renewed. In 2023, the EU re-approved glyphosate, the herbicide used in certain plant protection products, as an active substance until December 15, 2033. Following approval of an active substance in the EU, Member States control the authorization of formulated products containing that substance. Member States have various regulations limiting the use of products containing glyphosate. Despite the EU renewal of approval of glyphosate in 2023, some Member States continue to ban glyphosate partially or entirely, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Member State bans affect the use of the substance within that country’s national borders but do not affect any glyphosate MRLs, as all pesticide MRLs are determined at the EU level. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Government procurement is governed by the EU public procurement directives. The directive on procurement in the utilities sector covers purchases in the water, transportation, energy, and postal sectors. This directive requires open and competitive bidding procedures, but it gives Member States the option to reject bids with less than 50 percent EU content for tenders that are not covered by a multilateral or bilateral reciprocal agreement. The EU content requirement applies to foreign suppliers of goods and services in water (the production, transport, and distribution of drinking water), energy (gas and heat), urban transport (urban rail, automated systems, trams, buses), and postal services. The EU is a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-152-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 145 Member State Measures on Public Procurement Lack of transparency in certain Member State public procurement processes continues to be a barrier to the participation of U.S. firms. U.S. firms have also voiced concerns over onerous documentation requirements and implicit biases in favor of local vendors and other suppliers based on lowest cost instead of the full lifecycle of the procurement. Additional Member State-specific trade barriers to U.S. stakeholder participation in public procurement processes are discussed below. • Croatia: U.S. companies have complained about instances in which technical specifications and scoring in public procurement tenders appear to favor a specific bidder, typically a local or other Member State supplier, thus impacting the participation of competitive U.S. firms. • Greece: U.S. firms have complained that Greece often requires suppliers to source services and production locally or partner with Greek manufacturers as a condition for the awarding of some defense contracts. Additional complaints center on onerous certification and documentation requirements for foreign firms. These requirements have impeded the ability of U.S. firms to compete on a level playing field and engage in foreign military sales and public procurement processes in Greece. U.S. firms have also raised concerns over the use of “lowest cost” criteria as the primary determination for awarding contracts and have raised concern over instances when technical specifications and scoring in public procurement tenders appeared to favor a specific bidder. U.S. firms have cited numerous examples of non-transparent procurement processes in defense procurement. • Hungary: U.S. companies have expressed serious concerns that public procurements in Hungary are not always transparent and tend to favor either local or other non-EU countries, including China. Corruption in the public procurement system is of key concern in Hungary, despite the launching of multiple initiatives designed to address it in recent years. Hungary makes more frequent use of direct award and negotiated procedures than most other countries, without providing sufficient justification. In April 2022, the European Commission launched a budget conditionality mechanism against Hungary over the “systemic irregularities, deficiencies and weaknesses” in its public procurement procedures. • Lithuania and Portugal: U.S. firms have raised concerns over Lithuania’s and Portugal’s use of “lowest cost” criteria as the primary determination for awarding contracts. Although EU law allows for consideration of factors such as quality, company reputation, and prior experience in the decision-making criteria, “lowest cost” bidding continues to be a common practice in these two countries. • Slovakia: The excessive length and complexity of tender verification and appeal procedures remains an impediment to the widest possible participation of potential bidders. Lock-in contracts, in which the Slovak Government commits to procure a basic service and subsequently expands the contract to include additional services, continue to hamper the access of U.S. firms to public procurement, especially with regard to information technology services. • Slovenia: U.S. firms report instances of tendering documentation that provide unfair advantages to favored vendors, typically an EU company, and opacity in the bid evaluation process as major impediments. Slovenia’s quasi-judicial National Revision Commission (NRC), which reviews all disputed public procurement cases, has received multiple complaints. The NRC has the authority to review, amend, and cancel tenders, and its decisions are not subject to judicial appeal.

Proposed EU Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services The EU is considering a new cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services, (EUCS). The draft scheme is under discussion between cybersecurity security experts of the EU Member States, the European Commission, and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity. Once finalized, the EUCS is expected to be mandatory for parts of the public sector and possibly select private sector cloud services. The latest EUCS draft that is publicly available eliminates the sovereignty criteria and the requirement of data storage in the EU as necessary criteria to be certified at the highest level of cybersecurity. However, these changes face opposition from the French data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de I’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), and the French parliamentary Committee for Digital Postal Affairs. France is expected to advocate for stricter requirements in future debates within the EU. The EU covers cloud services in their GPA schedule and is required to offer non-discriminatory access to U.S. and other GPA suppliers for covered procurements. The United States has presented its concerns about these policies in the WTO Committee on Government Procurement and in bilateral meetings with EU officials. Member State Measures on Cloud Services • France: France’s national digital security agency, Agence Nationale de la Securite des Systemes d’Information (ANSSI), maintains a security certification scheme for cloud services, commonly referred to as SecNumCloud. In May 2021, the French Government issued a strategy for the use of cloud computing by the state (Trusted Cloud strategy), requiring that government agencies and commercial entities considered “critical” must select only cloud services vendors with a SecNumCloud certification to handle their highly sensitive data. As part of this strategy, ANSSI published in March 2022 a revision to the SecNumCloud certification requirements. This revision requires that any cloud provider that handles “highly sensitive” data must be at least 61 percent EU-owned and “immune” from non-EU laws. France’s Prime Minister signed an official circular on May 31, 2023, defining “sensitive data” to which SecNumCloud certification requirements apply. The vague definition of “sensitive data” could lead foreign cloud services suppliers to be increasingly precluded from providing cloud services to French public authorities. • Hungary: State and local government bodies and organizations are only allowed to process data in systems operated in the territory of Hungary. Electronic information systems can only be hosted in EU Member States for organizations providing services deemed as critical, which include energy, transportation, agriculture, and health industries. EU Defense Procurement On March 4, 2024, the European Commission released its first European Defense Industrial Strategy (EDIS) and related draft legislation, the European Defense Investment Program (EDIP), which essentially seeks to establish a subsidy program. Member States continue to negotiate EDIP’s final text. On September 17, 2024, the European Commission President sent a “mission letter” to the European Commissioner for Defense Space instructing the Commissioner to oversee the implementation of the defense strategy, including its recommendations related to procurement for EU-made equipment. EDIS notes the goal of allocating 50 percent of EU military procurement budgets to EU-made equipment by 2030, with an increase to 60 percent by 2035. Consistent with this “buy European” philosophy, current proposals for EDIP require that at least 65 percent of the value of EDIP-funded projects accrue to EU firms in order to be eligible to EDIP funding. Further, Member States are considering a provision in EDIP on ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-154-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 147 “design authority” that would remove access to U.S. manufacturers, or inclusion of U.S. government regulations related to future use, alterations, or eventual third-party exports of defense articles. This raises concerns for U.S. defense equipment suppliers including its potential impact on U.S. domestic manufacturing and U.S. investment opportunities in the European defense sector and would harm small and medium-sized European enterprises that seek to grow but also depend on U.S.-made components. EU Member States cover non-sensitive defense procurements in their international procurement obligations in the WTO GPA and all defense procurements for a limited number of Member States in their Reciprocal Defense Procurement (RDP) Agreements administered by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). EU Member States therefore are required to offer reciprocal non-discriminatory access to U.S. goods, services, and suppliers for covered procurements. The United States will continue to closely monitor developments in this area to ensure EU procurement continues to be implemented consistent with international procurement obligations. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION As part of the European Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy, the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (Copyright Directive) went into effect in June 2019, with the stated goal of addressing legal uncertainty for both right holders and users with regard to certain uses of copyright-protected works and other subject matter in the digital environment. Some stakeholders report that certain Member States’ transposition of the copyright directive weakens copyright protection. The United States continues to follow copyright issues in the EU and its Member States and will continue to engage with various EU entities as appropriate to address U.S. stakeholder equities. The Digital Services Act (DSA) entered into force on November 16, 2022. The DSA is intended to regulate certain online services, including through rules for how content is shared online. U.S. stakeholders have expressed concerns that the DSA’s adoption of a framework for limitations of liability included modifications to the eligibility threshold and conditions that had been set in the E-Commerce Directive, which may adversely impact their intellectual property (IP) rights, in particular for copyright and trademarks. The Data Act entered into force on January 11, 2024 and seeks to maximize the value of data and promoting innovation by increasing the transfer of data that is stored within devices and applications. The Data Act requires the disclosure and making available of data that may be protected by the data holder’s or a third party’s trade secrets, copyright, or other IP. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act entered into force on August 1, 2024 with various obligations applying at later stages. It aims to provide a risk-based approach to regulating the development, deployment, and use of AI-driven products, services, and systems. Stakeholders have concerns regarding the implementation of the Act related to source code, trade secrets, and copyright protection, including the requirement to comply with EU copyright law. The United States will continue to monitor developments. In response to the CJEU’s judgment in Recorded Artists Actors Performers (RAPP), the European Commission on September 11, 2023 opened a consultation on the conditions for remuneration of music performers and record producers from non-EU countries for recorded music played in the EU. The CJEU held that all sound recording producers and performers from contracting parties to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) are entitled to equitable remuneration. U.S. stakeholders are concerned about possible legislative change reversing the CJEU holding so that EU Member States will withhold royalties to U.S. producers and performers. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-155-2048.jpg) ![148 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS The United States remains very concerned by the EU’s overbroad protection of geographical indications (GIs), which adversely impacts both protection of U.S. trademarks and market access for U.S. products that use common names in the EU and third country markets. For example, Regulation (EU) 2024/1143 contains numerous problematic provisions governing the scope of protection and enforcement of Protected Designations of Origin (PDOs) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGIs), including expansive rules about evocation, extension, co-existence, and translation, among others. These troubling provisions not only adversely affect trademark rights and the ability to use common names, but also undermine access to the EU market for U.S. right holders and producers. In addition, the EU has granted GI protection to thousands of terms that limits use in the EU market to only certain EU producers, and the use of any term that even “evokes” a GI is also blocked. Despite this level of protection afforded to products sold within the EU, it appears that some producers in Member States continue to produce products featuring terms that are protected as GIs in other Member States and then export these products outside the EU. The EU has also granted GI protection to the cheese names danbo and havarti, widely traded cheeses that are covered by international standards under Codex. Several countries, including the United States, opposed GI protection of these common names both during the EU’s opposition period and at the WTO, but the European Commission granted the protection over that opposition and without sufficient explanation to interested parties. Regulation (EU) 2024/1143 also serves as the basis for the EU’s international GI agenda, which includes requiring EU trading partners to protect and enforce specific EU GIs in their markets, often with only limited due process requirements to safeguard existing producers, right holders, consumers, importers, and other interested parties. The United States continues to have concerns about the EU’s GI regulations and proposals, and monitors carefully their implementation and effects on bilateral trade. The United States is also concerned about Regulation (EU) 2023/2411, which goes into effect from December 1, 2025, and expands the scope of GI protection to craft and industrial products. The United States also does not believe that the EU should bargain for specific GI recognition in its bilateral trade agreements in return for market access, because such IP rights should be evaluated independently on their merits, based on the unique circumstances of each jurisdiction. Similarly, the United States is concerned by the EU’s attempts to restrict common terms for wine in third country markets. The United States is carefully monitoring the EU’s GI regulations and proposals as well as the implementation and effects of these regulations and proposals on bilateral trade. The United States remains very concerned by the conduct and outcome of the 2015 WIPO negotiations to expand the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration to include GIs. Of particular concern to the United States was the manner of engagement in these negotiations by the European Commission and by several Member States, including the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Italy, and Portugal, which took precedent-setting steps to deny the United States and the vast majority of WIPO countries full negotiating rights and depart from longstanding WIPO practice regarding consensus-based decision-making. Likewise, the resulting text—the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on Appellations of Origin and Geographical Indications—raises numerous and serious legal and commercial concerns, including with respect to the degree of inconsistency with the trademark systems of many WIPO countries, and could have significant negative commercial consequences for trademark holders and U.S. exporters that use common terms. The EU became a party to this Agreement in November 2019. The Agreement entered into force in February 2020.

The United States is particularly concerned about counterfeit pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment. • Belgium: Stakeholders are critical of Belgium’s enforcement efforts and state they are reactive and focus on detection rather than prevention. As a result, many right holders are dissuaded from enforcing their rights due to high-cost recovery and legal barriers, such as the burden of proof for commercial activity. • Bulgaria: Bulgaria remained on the Watch List of the 2024 Special 301 Report. In 2023, Bulgaria took an important step to address deficiencies in its investigation and prosecution of online piracy cases by passing the Act Amending and Supplementing the Criminal Code, which is intended to improve the investigation and prosecution of online piracy cases. However, since the passage of the Act, Bulgaria has not yet prosecuted anyone responsible for the online piracy sites that are hosted or operated from within the country. Bulgaria continued to be a safe haven for online piracy in 2024 and the United States will monitor for developments. • Germany: The 2021 transposition of the DSM Copyright Directive into German legislation introduced broad new exceptions for uses of copyright-protected works on online content sharing providers, which stakeholders say has weakened copyright protection and are being challenged before the Federal Constitutional Court. Stakeholders also voiced concerns over the implementation of Article 17 of the DSM Copyright Directive, which introduced direct remuneration claims for authors and owners of certain related rights, subject to mandatory collective rights management. Stakeholders alleged that the implementation placed unreasonable restrictions on the freedom of contract and, as a result, complaints have been filed with the German Constitutional Court. U.S. stakeholders also voiced concerns that Germany’s legal framework for technological protection measures remains inadequate and that Germany’s private copy exception is too broad. The United States will monitor how implementation impacts U.S. stakeholders. • Poland: Some stakeholders continued to identify copyright piracy online as a concern in Poland and some claimed inconsistent enforcement on the part of law enforcement and backlogs in the Polish courts. Some stakeholders also expressed concern about access to counterfeit products. Polish interlocutors in the Digital and Culture Ministries have identified online piracy and illegal streaming as enforcement priorities in bilateral meetings with U.S. government representatives. • Romania: Online piracy remains a concern with some notorious online pirate sites reportedly hosted or registered in Romania. Low penalties for IP violations impede investigations and do not offer any meaningful deterrent to further IP crimes, so law enforcement choose to bundle significant cases under tax evasion penal files. Romania lacks an effective and timely mechanism for right holders to submit takedown requests against online markets and hosting platforms for infringing material. Adequate resources, including additional training for law enforcement, are needed to enhance enforcement quality. Although Romania has made progress on addressing long-standing IP protection and enforcement concerns, the United States continues to closely follow IP-related developments in the country. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-157-2048.jpg) ![150 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS SERVICES BARRIERS Audiovisual Services In 2018, amendments to the 2007 Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) were adopted to reflect developments in the audiovisual and video-on-demand markets. Member States were given 21 months to transpose the amendments into national legislation. The original AVMSD established minimum content quotas for broadcasting that had to be enforced by all Member States. Member State requirements were permitted to exceed this minimum quota for EU content, and several have done so. However, the original AVMSD did not set any strict content quotas for on- demand services, although it still required Member States to ensure that on-demand services encourage production of, and access to, “EU works.” The 2018 amendments include provisions that impose on Internet-based video-on-demand providers a minimum 30 percent threshold for EU content in their catalogues and require that they give prominence to EU content in their offerings. The new AVMSD also provides Member States the option of requiring on- demand service providers not based in their territory, but whose targeted audience is in their territory, to contribute financially to EU works, based on revenues generated in that Member State. In addition, the new rules extend the scope of the AVMSD to video-sharing platforms that tag and organize content. Member State Measures on Audiovisual Services A number of Member States maintain measures that affect trade in audiovisual services. A summary of some of the more significant national practices follows. • Belgium: In the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, video-on-demand services must invest a percentage of revenue into regional audiovisual works or pay a levy to the region’s Cinema and Audiovisual Centre. In 2024, a new law entered into force that increased the mandatory contribution for the largest service suppliers to 9.5 percent of revenue. Additionally in 2024, the Flemish Parliament adopted a law increasing the investment obligation on VOD services from 2 percent to up to 4 percent, accompanied by additional restrictions relating to IP ownership limitations. • Denmark: The Danish Government passed legislation in 2024 that includes a five to seven percent tax on streaming services’ revenue in Denmark. The legislation would require a two percent basic contribution of revenue, and the choice between either investing at least five percent in Danish content, or an additional three percent contribution of revenue in Denmark from audiovisual content. • France: Internet, cable, and satellite networks are required to broadcast 50 percent EU content and 30 percent to 35 percent French-language content, and must increase their investment in the production of French-language content. For VOD services, France requires an investment obligation of at least 15 percent (for television VOD services) and up to 25 percent (for streaming VOD services) of their net annual French revenues. France also imposes significant sub-quotas (up to 75 percent) for commissioned independent productions and works of original French expression. The legislative framework does not provide an exemption for thematic or niche AV services. Cinemas must reserve five weeks per quarter for the exhibition of French feature films. This requirement is reduced to four weeks per quarter for theaters that include a French short subject ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-158-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 151 film during six weeks of the preceding quarter. Operators of multiplexes may not screen any one film in such a way as to account for more than 30 percent of the multiplex’s weekly shows. • Italy: The Italian Consolidated Audiovisual Media Services Act requires that 50 percent of eligible broadcast hours be European works, as defined in the measure, and that commercial television channel devote 16.6 percent of eligible hours to Italian works. In addition, domestic video-on- demand services must ensure that 30 percent of their catalogues are for European works produced within the past five years. Fifteen percent of a subscription video-on demand service’s catalogue must be dedicated to Italian works produced by independent producers within the past five years. Non-linear video-on-demand providers subject to Italian jurisdiction must also give prominence to EU works. Under the Italian law, commercial broadcasters must annually invest 12.5 percent of their revenues in the production of independent European works. Half of this money is reserved for Italian works. Foreign and domestic video-on-demand providers must devote 16 percent of their annual net revenues generated in Italy to the production of European independent works. Seventy percent of the investment obligation must be reserved for Italian works produced by independent Italian producers. • The Netherlands: A law mandating VOD service providers invest 5 percent of national revenues either into Dutch works or into the Dutch film fund entered into force in 2024. This law applies to VOD services with an annual turnover of at least €10 million (approximately $10.4 million) within the Netherlands, and includes a 60 percent sub-quota for independent productions. The Netherlands also imposes a 30 percent European works catalogue quota for VOD services. • Poland: Television broadcasters must dedicate at least 33 percent of their broadcasting time (excluding time allocated to information services, advertisements, telemarketing, sports broadcasts, and game shows) to programs originally produced in the Polish language, at least 50 percent of their broadcasting time to programs of EU origin, and at least 10 percent of their broadcasting time to programs by EU independent producers. On-demand services must promote content of EU origin, especially content originally produced in Polish, and dedicate at least 30 percent of their catalogue to EU content. • Spain: For every three days that a film from a non-EU country is screened, one EU film must be shown in movie theaters. This ratio is reduced to every four days if the cinema screens a film in an official language of Spain other than Spanish and keeps showing the film in that language throughout the day. The catalogue of on-demand services must include at least thirty percent EU content, of which at least half must be in an official language of Spain. In addition, broadcasters and on-demand services with revenues exceeding €50 million (approximately $52 million) must invest five percent of their revenues in the production of EU and Spanish works, and 40 percent of this allocation must be reserved for works of independent producers in any of Spain’s official languages. Professional Services Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Malta require EU or European Economic Area (EEA) nationality or citizenship for full admission to the bar, which is necessary for the practice of EU and Member State law.

The United States will continue to advocate for Member States to take into account the experience of U.S. certified public accountants acquired outside of the EU. Telecommunications Services Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications In January 2017, the European Commission proposed a new Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications, which would replace the e-Privacy Directive of 2002. The proposed regulation would expand the scope of the existing directive, which applies to traditional telecommunications services providers, to include over-the-top Internet-enabled services. U.S. suppliers have expressed concerns that, although the proposed regulation is supposed to align the specific rules for telecommunications services with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it may lead to additional and potentially conflicting requirements. The European Parliament adopted its version of the proposed regulation in 2017 and the Council of the European Union adopted its version of the proposed regulation in 2021. In February 2025, however, the Commission announced plans to withdraw the proposal for the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications because no agreement is expected between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Digital Services Taxation The United States and EU Member States are among the 137 member jurisdictions to have joined the October 8, 2021, OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitization of the Economy, which called for all Parties to commit to not introduce digital services taxes (DSTs) in the future. On October 21, 2021, the United States, under the prior Administration, joined Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK) in a joint statement “on a transitional approach to existing Unilateral Measures while implementing Pillar 1.” According to the statement, DST liability that accrued to Austria, France, Italy, Spain, or the UK during a transitional period prior to the implementation of Pillar 1 would be creditable in defined circumstances against future corporate income tax liability due under Pillar 1. In return, Section 301 trade actions initiated during 2019 and 2020 on goods with respect to each of Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK were not continued. The arrangement set out in the October 21, 2021, joint statement was extended to June 30, 2024. On January 20, 2025 the United States issued a White House Memorandum titled “The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal (Global Tax Deal).” The memorandum stated: The Secretary of the Treasury and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the OECD shall notify the OECD that any commitments made by the prior administration on behalf of the United States with respect to the Global Tax Deal have no force of effect within the United States absent an act by the Congress adopting the relevant provisions of the Global Tax Deal. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-160-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 153 On January 22, 2025, appropriate representatives of the Treasury Department provided notice to the Director of the Centre of Tax Policy and Administration at the OECD. On January 24, 2025, the U.S. Permanent Delegation to the OECD provided similar notice to the Secretary General of the OECD. Digital Services Act The Digital Services Act (DSA) entered into force in November 2022, and took effect on February 17, 2024, with certain provisions already in effect on November 16, 2022. The DSA provides the Commission authority to regulate the business practices of certain large digital services suppliers, designated as “Very Large Online Platforms” (VLOPs), which include online platforms with “average monthly active recipients of the service” in the EU equal to or higher than 45 million (this number will be adjusted by the EU in the future to ensure it corresponds to 10 percent of the EU population). The DSA also imposes strict transparency and reporting obligations and audit requirements, and requires VLOPs to address “systemic risks” present in their services. The DSA defines systemic risks as the dissemination of illegal content, any negative effects for the exercise of certain fundamental rights, and intentional manipulation of the service. A VLOP has to consider how its content moderation systems, recommendation systems, and systems for displaying advertisements, influence these risks and enact mitigation measures for any systemic risks. Once a platform is designated as a VLOP by the Commission, the platform has four months to come into compliance with its obligations under the DSA. The DSA provides the Member States and the Commission with the authority to impose fines not exceeding six percent of the total annual turnover of a VLOP and in some instances can impose a periodic fine of up to 5 percent of average daily global turnover for each day a VLOP fails to comply with a remedy, interim measure, or commitment imposed by the Commission. In certain instances, the Commission can also order a VLOP to suspend its operations in the EU. The DSA also provides the Commission with the power to adopt “delegated acts” for portions of the DSA, granting the Commission expansive authority to adopt additional regulation. On April 25, 2023, the European Commission designated the first set of VLOPs. The majority of designated VLOPs are U.S. firms, resulting in regulatory burdens that disproportionately affect U.S. firms. Digital Markets Act The Digital Markets Act (DMA) entered into force in November 2022 and took effect in May 2023. The DMA provides the Commission with authority to regulate the business practices of certain large digital services suppliers, designated as “gatekeepers.” The DMA authorizes the Commission to impose fines not exceeding 10 percent of the total annual turnover of a gatekeeper, and in case of repeat offenses 20 percent of total annual turnover, and provides the Commission with the power to adopt “delegated acts” for portions of the DMA, thereby granting the Commission expansive authority to adopt additional regulation. While the Commission has broad authority to determine that any provider of one or more core platforms services is a “gatekeeper,” and is therefore subject to the DMA’s requirements, the DMA sets out that the Commission should designate as a “gatekeeper” any provider that: (1) provides a core platform services in at least three Member States and has an annual EEA turnover of €6.5 billion (approximately $7.7 billion) or more over the previous three years, or an average market capitalization of at least €65 billion (approximately $78 million); and (2) has had, for each of the last three financial years, 45 million monthly active end users established or located in the EU and more than 10,000 yearly active business users established in the EU. A company that meets the criteria to be designated a gatekeeper under the DMA has a two-month period in which to notify the Commission that it believes that it meets the criteria to be designated a gatekeeper. Following that notification, the Commission has 45 working days to decide on the company’s gatekeeper designation. Once a provider has been designated as a gatekeeper, the provider will have six months to come into compliance with a number of obligations set out in Articles 5 and 6 of ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-161-2048.jpg) ![154 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS the DMA. The Commission designated the first set of “gatekeepers” in September 2023 and they were given six months to comply. The DMA defines “core platform services” to include a broad swath of existing digital services, including online intermediation services, online search engines, online social networking services, video sharing platform services, number-independent interpersonal communications services, operating systems, cloud computing services, and advertising services (including networks, exchanges, and any other advertising intermediation services). The DMA provides the Commission with authority to add new services to the list of “core platform services.” The DMA gives the Commission broad authority to conduct market investigations to determine whether to designate a provider as a gatekeeper and whether a gatekeeper is in full compliance with obligations under the DMA. If the Commission determines that a gatekeeper has “systemically infringed” obligations in Articles 5 and 6 of the DMA and has “further strengthened or extended its gatekeeper position,” the Commission may impose “any behavioral or structural remedies” that are proportionate to the infringement. The “gatekeepers” designated by the DMA disproportionately capture U.S. firms compared to their EU competitors, and therefore undermine U.S. competitiveness in the European market by increasing the compliance costs on certain U.S. firms while not placing a similar burden on EU competitors. The Commission is currently investigating U.S. firms and has imposed excessive fines for violating the DMA. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act The EU AI Act entered into force in August 2024, with rules applying in a staggered manner between February 2025 and August 2027. The Act establishes a risk-based approach to regulating AI systems by identifying AI systems as minimal, limited, high, or unacceptable risks, and regulating accordingly, including through conformity assessment. The AI Act applies differentiated obligations to various actors, in an effort to include the AI systems’ manufacturers, importers, and users. The Act’s scope applies to services such as machine learning programs, translations programs, speech to text conversion, or forecasting and optimization programs. The Act employs the strictest requirements on applications deemed “high-risk”, such as facial recognition technology, credit scoring, and critical infrastructure. AI systems deemed as “unacceptable risk” are banned. The Act will be supplemented by Implementing Acts and standards to operationalize its requirements for general-purpose AI, foundation models and high-risk AI. The Commission launched a consultation on a Code of Practice for providers of general-purpose AI (AI systems designed to perform a broad range of tasks, such as large-language models), which is expected to be finalized by April 2025. The AI Act will also require providers of general-purpose AI to disclose a “sufficiently detailed” summary of their model training data. The Commission is currently developing a template for these disclosures. If the template requires granular disclosure of training data, it may impinge on the IP, including trade secrets of model developers. CEN and CENELEC, the European standardization bodies, have launched a dedicated technical committee (JTC 21) to develop harmonized standards that will support the implementation of the AI Act, including a framework for AI trustworthiness and standards for AI risk management and quality assurance. It remains unclear whether these standards will be consistent with existing ISO standards (e.g., ISO 42001). Divergent standards would require U.S. firms to adapt to EU-specific requirements. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-162-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 155 Data Act The Data Act entered into force in January 2024, and its rules will go into effect on September 12, 2025. The Act establishes rules for access and use of both personal and non-personal data by businesses, consumers, researchers, and public sector bodies, including data generated by connected devices and digital services. The Act applies to the transfer or “sharing” of business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and business to-government non-personal data that is stored within industrial applications (e.g., robots, wind farms) and smart devices (e.g., smart TVs, connected cars). The Data Act regulates the rights of users (in many cases meaning the generators of such data, like the users of smart TVs or drivers of connected cars) to access data that these connected machines or devices generate. The Data Act also mandates certain sharing of this data with third parties, including researchers, public sector bodies, and other private companies. Firms may only refuse access to data covered by trade secrets in exceptional circumstances, but can require the users and third parties to preserve the confidentiality of data considered to be trade secrets. Additionally, the Data Act requires cloud service and other data processing service providers to remove obstacles for customers terminating their service. On international transfers of non-personal data, the rules oblige providers of such services to take “all reasonable technical, legal and organizational measures, including contractual arrangements” to prevent international transfers or governmental access to non-personal data that are in conflict with EU or Member state law. This may impose burdensome requirements on U.S. service providers and undermine the ability of U.S. providers of such services to compete in the European market. Data Localization The GDPR took effect in May 2018. The GDPR restricts the transfer of the personal data of EU “data subjects” (any natural person whose personal data is being processed) outside of the EU, except to specific countries that the EU has determined provide adequate data protection under EU law or when other specific requirements are met, such as the use of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) or binding corporate rules. Restrictions on the flow of data have a significant effect on the conditions for the cross-border supply of numerous services and for enabling the functionality embedded in intelligent goods (i.e., smart devices), among other effects. Due to the EU’s assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction for the GDPR, as well as the GDPR’s broad impact on many areas of the economy, U.S. companies have expressed concerns that there remains a need for clear and consistent guidance in the implementation and enforcement of the GDPR. In July 2016, the European Commission granted the United States an adequacy decision that applies to companies participating in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. In July 2020, however, the CJEU issued a judgment in the Schrems II litigation that invalidated the Commission’s decision. Although the CJEU’s judgment upheld the overall validity of SCCs, it nonetheless imposed an affirmative obligation on entities using SCCs “to verify, on a case-by-case basis ... whether the law of the third country of destination ensures adequate protection, under EU law, of personal data transferred pursuant to standard data production clauses ….” In January and February 2022, multiple European Data Protection Authorities issued rulings that certain websites transferring analytics data to the United States were in breach of the GDPR, based on the Schrems II judgment. On March 25, 2022, the United States and EU announced that they have agreed in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which is designed to provide a new mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Union. In July 2023, the Commission granted the United States an adequacy decision for the DPF, and organizations that self-certify their compliance with the DPF principles started transferring personal data from the EU to the U.S. in reliance on the DPF without SSCs. As of December 31, 2024, there were two pending legal challenges in the CJEU against the DPF, one on administrative grounds and one on substantive issues. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-163-2048.jpg) ![156 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Network Usage Fees On May 2, 2022, the European Telecommunications Network Operators Association (ETNO) released a report urging the European Commission to adopt new regulation that would require large Internet-enabled service suppliers to pay network usage fees to European telecommunications network operators in order to recoup costs they claim telecommunications network operators bear due to carrying high-bandwidth content. On October 7, 2022, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) adopted a report that concluded the ETNO proposal was unnecessary and “could be of significant harm to the Internet ecosystem.” On February 23, 2023, the European Commission launched a public consultation on the EU’s connectivity sector and telecommunications infrastructure. On May 19, 2023, the United States submitted formal comments to the European Commission raising concerns with mandating direct payments from content and application suppliers to telecommunications network operators. On October 10, 2023, the European Commission published the results of this consultation, concluding that no plan for network usage fees would proceed given the feedback from stakeholders. On February 21, 2024, the European Commission published a white paper entitled “How to Master Europe’s Infrastructure Needs?”. On September 17, 2024, President of the European Commission, in her mission letter to the Executive Vice- President-designate for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, charged her with work on developing a new “Digital Networks Act to help boost secure high-speed broadband, both fixed and wireless” and directed her to “incentivize and encourage investments in digital infrastructure, taking into account responses to the Commission’s White Paper of February 2024.” INVESTMENT BARRIERS With few exceptions, EU law generally requires that any company established under the law of one Member State must receive national treatment in all other Member States, regardless of the company’s ultimate ownership. Laws and regulations pertaining to the initial entry of foreign (i.e., non-EU) investors, however, largely remain the purview of individual Member States. As discussed below, the policies and practices of Member States can have a significant impact on U.S. investment. Member State Measures on Investment • Croatia: While Croatia generally affords foreign investors the same treatment as domestic investors, Croatian law restricts non-EU ownership and control in certain sectors, such as inland waterways transport, maritime transport, rail transport, air to ground handling, freight-forwarding, publishing, ski instruction, and primary mandated healthcare. • Cyprus: Cypriot law imposes restrictions on non-EU ownership in certain sectors and activities. For example, only EU citizens have the right to register as construction contractors in Cyprus, and non-EU investors are not allowed to own a majority stake in a local construction company. In addition, a non- EU investor may not own more than five percent of a local television or radio station, and total non-EU ownership of any single local TV or radio station is restricted to a maximum of 25 percent. • Denmark: Denmark is generally open to foreign investment, but requires at least 20 percent government ownership for projects that require licenses or tenders in oil and gas exploration, carbon capture and storage, and offshore wind farms. Some stakeholders have expressed concern that the government ownership requirement could delay or hinder the deployment of both renewable and traditional energy technologies and projects. • Germany: Germany has a novel withholding tax related to IP such as patents and trademarks registered in Germany, which is applied to all or nearly all revenues related to a license or other IP transfer ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-164-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 157 agreement that is attributable to that registered IP, even when there is no related economic activity in Germany. By levying this withholding tax, German tax authorities appear to be applying the German Income Tax Act’s section 49 paragraph 1 number 2-f retroactively and extraterritorially to related-party transactions, including both royalties and IP restructuring transactions. The approach does not conform with international tax practices and appears to be applied almost exclusively to U.S. firms. • Hungary: In 2020, the Hungarian Parliament passed a law requiring the reporting of foreign investments to the government in certain sectors, including transportation, healthcare, energy, tourism, defense, finance, and information technology. The Hungarian Government reviews and grants approvals on the basis of the impact of the notified investment on the public interest, public safety, or public order, among other factors. This process is separate from Hungary’s national security-based investment screening mechanism, which was established in 2018. Although this legislation was originally set to expire on December 31, 2022, it was extended in December 2021 without a date of expiry. Stakeholders report that there are key differences between the two investment screening mechanisms, including their scopes, definitions, implementing ministries, and review procedures, which lead to complexities and delays with investing in Hungary. The European Court of Justice ruled in 2023 that Hungary’s foreign investment screening law is incompatible with EU law, in particular the freedom of establishment. In 2024, Hungary amended the law to grant a pre-emption right to the Minister of Energy for notified investments in Hungarian companies engaged in solar power generation. If exercised, the pre-emption right entitles the National Asset Management Company, a state-owned asset holding company, to acquire ownership of the solar power company. • Italy: U.S. companies have complained that unclear processes and lengthy delays have hindered their ability to apply for and obtain licenses or permits for energy and infrastructure investment projects in Italy. Once licenses or permits have been granted, U.S. companies have faced legal and bureaucratic hurdles that have hindered their ability to obtain concessions. • Latvia: U.S. investors have reported that the judicial system in Latvia can present significant challenges, particularly in regard to insolvency proceedings that often take several years to resolve. U.S. stakeholders also continue to voice similar concerns about civil cases. • Poland: Polish law limits non-EU citizens to 49 percent ownership of companies operating in air transport, radio and television broadcasting, and airport and seaport operations. Under the previous government, U.S. investors reported that the Polish tax system was complex and unpredictable, with generally short time periods between the announcement of the legislation and its entry into force. Since December 2023, the Polish Government has committed to taking steps to improve the Polish tax system, including by consulting with the private sector and increasing lead time on proposed legislative changes. In addition, the previous government took measures such as sectoral taxes, fines, and use of state- controlled companies to purchase media to increase the percentage of domestic ownership in industries such as media, banking, and retail, which had large holdings by foreign companies. With respect to the media sector, the current government has a stated goal of deregulating and privatizing the sector. • Portugal: While Portugal generally affords foreign investors the same treatment as domestic investors, Portuguese law requires companies engaged in the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity; the production of gas; the pipeline transportation of fuels; wholesale services of electricity; retailing services of electricity and non-bottled gas; and services incidental to electricity and natural gas distribution to have an entity incorporated and with effective management in Portugal to qualify for concessions. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-165-2048.jpg) ![158 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS • Spain: While Spain generally affords foreign investors the same treatment as domestic investors, Spanish law restricts individual non-EU ownership of audio-visual broadcasting licenses to 25 percent. Specifically, a non-EU company may own no more than 25 percent of a company holding a digital terrestrial television broadcasting license, and total non-EU ownership may not exceed 50 percent in the aggregate. • Sweden: Sweden is generally open to foreign investment but restricts non-EU ownership in certain limited professional services, including by prohibiting non-EU ownership of any corporation or partnership providing legal services and by limiting non-EU investment to no more than 25 percent in the accountancy sector. SUBSIDIES Various financial transactions and equity arrangements in the EU raise questions about the role of state funding in supporting or subsidizing private or quasi-private organizations, including in the manufacture of civil aircraft. Government Support for Airbus In October 2019, after 15 years of litigation, the WTO authorized the United States to take $7.5 billion in trade countermeasures in the dispute against the EU, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom regarding their illegal subsidies for the Airbus consortium. On June 15, 2021, the United States and the EU announced a cooperative framework to address the large civil aircraft disputes. The cooperative framework suspended each side’s tariffs related to this dispute for five years. The United States and the EU also agreed to principles for government support in this sector, including their shared intent that any financing for the production or development of large civil aircraft be on market terms. The United States and the EU further agreed to collaborate on jointly analyzing and addressing non-market policies and practices of third countries that may harm the U.S. and EU large civil aircraft industries. Over many years, France, Germany, Spain, and, to a much lesser extent, Belgium, have provided subsidies to Airbus-affiliated national companies to aid in the development, production, and marketing of Airbus’s large civil aircraft. These governments have financed from 33 percent to 100 percent of the development costs (launch aid) for all Airbus aircraft models. They have also provided other forms of support, including equity infusions, debt forgiveness, debt rollovers, marketing assistance, and research and development funding, and have applied political and economic pressure on purchasing governments. The cooperative framework affirms the EU’s intent to provide future funding only on market terms. In addition to these subsidies, the EU maintains aeronautics research programs that are driven significantly by a policy intended to enhance the international competitiveness of the EU civil aeronautics industry. EU Member State governments have spent hundreds of millions of euros to create infrastructure for Airbus programs. The United States will monitor any government financing of Airbus closely. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-166-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 159 Subsidies for Fruit and Vegetables The EU Common Market Organization (CMO) provides a framework for market measures under the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, including for measures related to the promotion of fruit and vegetables. Implementing rules covering fresh and processed products are designed to encourage the development of producer organizations (POs) as the main vehicle for crisis management and market promotion. The CMO makes payments to POs for dozens of products, including peaches, citrus fruits, and olives. In 2015, a new basic payment scheme and greening payments were introduced, replacing the single payment scheme. Direct payments also are paid to support certain processing sectors, including, for example, peaches for juicing in Greece. The general lack of transparency around the distribution of EU subsidies at the Member State level in the fruit and vegetable industry raises questions about whether the payments are decoupled from production, and U.S. producers remain concerned about potential hidden subsidies. The United States continues to monitor and review EU assistance in this sector, evaluating potential trade- distorting effects. OTHER BARRIERS Pharmaceutical Products On April 26, 2023, the European Commission published a proposal to revise the EU’s general pharmaceutical legislation. The proposal included a new directive and a new regulation relating to medicinal products for human use intended to address, in part, regulatory protection for innovative medicines and to create more favorable procedures for marketing authorization. This would provide incentives for companies to launch simultaneously across the EU. However, the conditions attached to the incentives include factors that may not be fully within the control of companies, such as processing times for marketing authorization and reimbursement determinations in each EU Member State. The European Commission also published, on October 24, 2023, a “Communication on Addressing medicine shortages in the EU,” which adopted a set of actions to address critical shortages of medicines and enhance the security of their supply in the EU. The revision to the EU pharmaceutical legislation was in the final stages of the legislative process as of December 31, 2024. The European Parliament adopted its position on the reform on April 10, 2024. The next step involves a detailed review by the Council of the European Union, with a vote for adoption expected in 2025. The United States is monitoring developments. Member State Measures on Pharmaceutical Products U.S. pharmaceutical stakeholders have expressed concerns about several EU Member State policies affecting market access for pharmaceutical products, including non-transparent procedures and a lack of meaningful stakeholder input into policies related to pricing and reimbursement. These policies have been identified in several Member States as described below. Stakeholders have also expressed concerns over inconsistent and lengthy time periods for pricing and reimbursement decisions. U.S. industry stakeholders have grown increasingly concerned about policies that are being formulated with little opportunity for engagement. In addition, changes to EMA policy regarding disclosures of clinical trial data, including potential disclosure of confidential commercial information submitted to EMA by pharmaceutical firms seeking marketing authorization, are also of concern to stakeholders.

Imported products are only eligible for up to a five percent price premium. Meanwhile, initiatives intended to lead to faster market access for new innovative drugs have been slowly, and incompletely, implemented. • Czech Republic: Although the Czech Republic’s system for determining pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement for innovation remains challenging for U.S. companies, many report the situation has improved after new legislation came into effect in early 2022. Still, U.S. companies continue to express concerns regarding lengthy reimbursement processes. • France: U.S. stakeholders have expressed concerns that the process of gaining market access for drugs in France is slower than elsewhere in the EU, resulting from delays in reimbursement approvals of as much as 19 months after marketing authorization, compared to the no more than 16 months required by EU law. • Greece: U.S. pharmaceutical industry stakeholders have continued to raise major concerns about the lack of transparency or opportunities for meaningful stakeholder input into the application of policies. Stakeholders have also raised concerns about lengthy reimbursement timelines and inconsistent application of pricing and reimbursement processes. • Hungary: U.S. pharmaceutical industry stakeholders have expressed concerns regarding delays in decision-making and reimbursement and lengthy processes for making changes to the list of drugs approved for reimbursement. The average wait time to include an innovative therapy in the national reimbursement is over two years in Hungary, which is one of the longest in the EU. U.S. pharmaceutical industry stakeholders note the lack of opportunity to provide input into these pricing and reimbursement processes. • Ireland: Pharmaceutical industry stakeholders, including many U.S. firms, continue to express concerns over the Irish Government’s delays in reimbursement decisions. Access to new drugs and innovative medicines are subject to a lengthy decision process. In response to stakeholder complaints in February 2023, the Irish Government published a report recommending improvements in the reimbursement approval process, including an increase in governance and transparency. The Minister of Health established an implementation working group to consider and progress the report recommendations. As of December 31, 2024, the Ministry was progressing 13 of the 17 recommendations of the report. Industry is encouraged by Ireland’s Ministry of Health’s creation of an internal working group aimed at making the reimbursement process more efficient. • Italy: U.S. healthcare industry stakeholders face an unpredictable business environment in Italy, which includes the Italian Government’s highly variable implementation of complex pricing and reimbursement policies, and have raised concerns about reimbursement delays for pharmaceutical products and delayed payments for medical devices. Moreover, the average time Italian public hospitals take to pay medical device suppliers continues to exceed the maximum period permitted by EU law. U.S. industry stakeholders continue to request that the Italian Government address these issues. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-168-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 161 • Poland: U.S. stakeholders have expressed concerns over the lack of opportunity for meaningful stakeholder input into Poland’s rulemaking and tendering processes, as well as the transparency of reimbursement rules for pharmaceutical products. U.S. industry stakeholders report that Poland’s pricing and reimbursement system is backlogged, taking more than 844 days on average from regulatory approval to patient access. The United States will continue to urge Poland to engage meaningfully with stakeholders with respect to their concerns. • Romania: Innovative pharmaceutical producers have identified several significant challenges resulting from the Romanian Government’s failure to update, despite repeated requests, the lists of innovative pharmaceuticals that are eligible for reimbursement under the national health system, with numerous applications pending. In addition, both innovative and generic pharmaceutical companies have withdrawn drugs from the Romanian market, as the official prices set in Romania can fall below production costs. • Spain: U.S. pharmaceutical industry stakeholders continue to note concerns as to cost containment measures affecting the industry, including lack of clarity around criteria for reimbursement, substantial delays in reimbursement processes, and uneven patient access across autonomous regions. Industry stakeholders have raised concerns about lack of clarity in the guidelines and decision-making criteria of the Spanish Government’s procurement process for vaccines. EU Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas Regulation The F-Gas policies initially discussed in the Technical Barriers to Trade section of this NTE Report chapter place restrictions on the sale of certain refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, foams, and propellants that use fluorinated gases. In particular, using a quota system, the F-Gas policies limit and, over time, progressively restrict the quantity of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) available for use in the EU. The European Union’s update to its F-Gas policies, Regulation (EU) 2024/573, went into force in March 2024 with additional restrictions relative to current 2030 targets. U.S. stakeholders have expressed concerns that the regulation’s reductions in HFC quotas and imposition of an unrealistic timeline to introduce lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) alternatives has increased illegal trade in HFCs. U.S. stakeholders also have expressed concerns that insufficient oversight and enforcement by the EU and many Member States of F-Gas Regulation (EU) 2024/573 has allowed for widespread importations of HFCs that exceed, and otherwise are not accounted for under, the EU’s quota system. Such imports negatively affect U.S. exporters of environmentally friendly alternative refrigerants and undermine stated EU environmental objectives. U.S. stakeholders have further expressed concerns that the potentially different approaches between F-Gas Regulation (EU) 2024/573 and REACH’s forthcoming definition of PFAS could pose a compliance challenge. The United States and stakeholders are also concerned that HFCs are trafficked without the knowledge of customs officials, either hidden or falsely declared on customs forms, or they are imported unaccounted for when already integrated in equipment containing HFCs. EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism On October 1, 2023, the EU began implementing the transitional period for its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) regulation. The transitional phase will last until December 31, 2025. The adopted EU Implementing Regulation details the transitional reporting obligations for EU importers of CBAM goods, as well as the transitional methodology for calculating embedded emissions released during the production process of CBAM goods. During the CBAM’s transitional phase, traders will have to report on ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-169-2048.jpg) ![162 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS the emissions embedded in their imports subject to the mechanism, but are not required to pay any financial adjustment. The sectors that will be initially affected are cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen. CBAM may eventually extend to other sectors covered under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) after the transition phase concludes. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about the implementation of the CBAM, including complicated reporting requirements and uncertainty around final procedures. By the middle of 2025, the Commission is planning to review the lessons learned from the transitional period to make adjustments to the process. Beginning in 2026, CBAM will impose a fee on embedded emissions of imports. The fee will be linked to the carbon price in the EU ETS. While the EU’s CBAM will credit imports for explicit carbon prices paid by foreign producers in their home market, U.S. exports may not be eligible for such credits since CBAM does not offer credits for regulatory and other non-price mechanisms for reducing carbon emissions. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-170-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 163 GHANA IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs Ghana’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 12 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Ghana’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 15.9 percent for agricultural products and 11.4 percent for nonagricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Ghana has bound 15.1 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 92.0 percent. Ghana has bound all agricultural tariffs in the WTO at an average rate of 96.6 percent—more than six times the average level of its MFN applied rates on agricultural goods. Ghana has bound some selected agricultural goods, including milk and cream, eggs, tea, wheat, and oil cake at 15 percent. Nearly 99 percent of Ghana’s tariffs on industrial goods are unbound at the WTO. Consistent with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Common External Tariff (CET), Ghana applies five tariff bands: (1) zero percent duty on essential social goods (e.g., medicine); (2) 5 percent duty on essential commodities, raw materials, and capital goods; (3) 10 percent duty on intermediate goods; (4) 20 percent duty on consumer goods; and (5) 35 percent duty on certain goods that the Ghanaian Government elected to afford greater protection. The CET was slated to be fully harmonized by 2020, but, in practice, some ECOWAS Member States have maintained deviations from the CET beyond the January 1, 2020 deadline. Ghana was still in the process of adopting the Harmonized Schedule 2022 changes to the CET tariff schedule as of December 2024. The Customs (Amendment) Act, 2020 (Act 1014) increased the import duty on vehicles and parts from between 5 percent and 20 percent to 35 percent on some specified vehicles such as passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, and light commercial vehicles. Ghana applied the 35 percent tariff rate to vehicles that are less than five years old, retaining the current lower tariffs on older vehicles. Ghana has not notified this proposed tariff change to the WTO. Taxes Imports are subject to a variety of fees and charges in addition to tariffs. These include a 15.0 percent VAT, a 2.5 percent Ghana Education Trust Fund Levy, a 2.5 percent National Health Insurance Levy, and a 1.0 percent COVID-19 Health Recovery Levy. In principle, these taxes are chargeable on the value of goods and services produced or provided in Ghana, as well as on imports, but the government has largely not succeeded in exacting the taxes from all local businesses. Separately, as part of Ghana’s Automotive Development Policy, Ghana currently exempts domestically assembled automobiles from its 15 percent VAT, although it is applying it to imports of automobiles. Like all ECOWAS countries, Ghana imposes a 1 percent ECOWAS levy on all goods originating from non- ECOWAS countries to finance the activities of the ECOWAS Commission and Community institutions. Ghana also imposes a 0.2 percent levy on imports from outside African Union (AU) Member States to fund its contribution to the AU. Other taxes and charges have proliferated in recent years. Under the Ghana Export-Import Bank Act, 2017, Ghana imposes a 0.75 percent levy on all nonpetroleum products imported in commercial quantities. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-171-2048.jpg) ![164 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Effective through 2024, Ghana imposes a special levy of 2 percent on all imports, except for machinery and equipment listed under Chapters 84 and 85 of the Harmonized System and some petroleum products and fertilizers. On October 18, 2024, Ghana’s President signed the Ghana Shippers’ Authority (GSA) bill, which imposes a new levy of two percent on the gross freight value of shipments by carriers. Section 37 (1) of the Act states that “a carrier operating in the country shall pay a levy of two percent of the gross freight value of a shipment to or from the country to the authority [GSA].” Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans and Import Restrictions Ghana requires registration certificates for imports of food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural goods. Since 2014, Ghana has banned the importation of tilapia and has limited the issuance of import permits for corn, poultry, and poultry products, although the government no longer enforces a domestic purchase requirement as a condition for import. Since 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture has issued and renewed poultry import permits on an ad hoc basis, and the issuance and renewal application and approval processes lack transparency, leading to uncertainty for traders. Under the Customs (Amendment) Act, 2020 (Act 1014), imports of vehicles older than 10 years are prohibited. The implementation continues to be delayed. Ghana imposed a temporary ban on the importation of excavators to regulate their use in illegal mining, effective May 2019. Import exemptions are granted on an exceptional basis, but the issuance is often delayed. On November 30, 2023, the Ministry of Trade and Industry proposed a new import permitting system that would cover 24 broad product categories and would potentially affect the trade of hundreds of tariff lines of intermediate and final industrial and agricultural goods (rice, poultry, autos, apparel, and iron and steel, among other goods). The system would essentially limit the number of importers and establish quotas. As of December 31, 2024, Ghana has not notified the WTO Import Licensing Committee of this measure and has not scheduled quotas in its WTO goods schedules for any of the affected goods. As of December 31, 2024, the proposed measure remains pending and has not been formally reintroduced as subsidiary legislation or permanently withdrawn. Foreign Exchange Restrictions The temporary withdrawal of foreign exchange support for the importation of goods classified as “non- critical” or “non-essential” announced by the Bank of Ghana in November 2022 affects goods including rice, poultry, vegetable oils, pasta, and fruit juice, as well as ceramic tiles and toothpicks. Ghana defends its action as part of efforts to ensure the country’s foreign exchange reserves while encouraging domestic production and consumption of import substitutes; however, Ghana is unable to meet domestic demand for poultry meat and rice with domestic production. U.S. rice and poultry exports are down significantly since Ghana first implemented its foreign exchange restrictions in 2021. In 2023, U.S. rice exports were significantly lower, under $400,000, down from $3.9 million during 2021. In 2023, U.S. poultry meat exports were $57.2 million, down from $92.6 million during 2021. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-172-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 165 Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Ghanaian customs practices and port infrastructure continue to present major obstacles to trade. Officials have introduced risk management approaches; however, the majority of imports are still subject to inspection on arrival. Anecdotal reports suggest between 60 percent and 80 percent of imports are still subject to physical inspection or scanning, causing delays. This is well beyond Ghana’s announced goal of reducing inspections to roughly 10 percent of imports, based on risk, for agricultural products. Importers report erratic application of customs and other import regulations, lengthy clearance procedures, and corruption. The resulting delays can contribute to unnecessary demurrage charges and product deterioration, resulting in significant losses for importers of perishable goods. The Customs Division of the GRA has taken on the inspection and valuation role once occupied by five licensed destination inspection companies. This has slightly reduced delays, although the high rate of physical inspections noted above remains an impediment. Ghana has launched several initiatives to support online information and processing of trade transactions. Ghana’s Single Window, launched in 2020, handles import, export, and transit declaration submissions online. Although Ghana’s Customs Act of 2015 (section 67) indicates that customs valuation should primarily be based on transaction value or the price actually paid or payable for goods imported into the country, in practice, stakeholders indicate that the GRA often applies a benchmark to determine customs valuation for every imported product or uses the higher of the benchmark or the transaction value. The GRA Customs Technical Services Bureau (CTSB) uses a customs valuation database that includes data from customs valuation databases of various tax authorities from other countries. The GRA CTSB subscribes to these data on an annual basis. Data from these entities, together with the GRA’s own data, are then used to determine the benchmark values. Although the GRA CTSB’s customs valuation may address the concern about under-invoicing goods and under-collecting duties, a system of risk management to assess transaction value trends of imported goods can identify real under-invoicing, without imposing potential inaccurate benchmarking on all goods. Imported vehicles in Ghana are subject to a customs examination fee of 1 percent. Section 60 of the Customs Act of 2015 indicates that valuation for purposes of the tariff and other duties and charges should be based on the first purchase price, then discounted by fixed amount by age. In practice, to establish the customs value of imported vehicles, the GRA Customs Division uses a system of online vehicle identification number information and age-based value benchmarking for each vehicle. This system tends to overvalue used vehicles, in particular. Imported used vehicles more than 10 years old incur an additional charge ranging from 12.5 percent to 20.0 percent of the cost, insurance, and freight value. Ghana ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in January 2017. Ghana has not yet submitted notifications related to import, export, and transit regulations. This notification was due to the WTO on June 22, 2022, according to Ghana’s self-designated TFA implementation schedule. Ghana has not yet notified its customs valuation legislation to the WTO and has not yet responded to the Checklist of Issues that describes how the Customs Valuation Agreement is being implemented. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-173-2048.jpg) ![166 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade High Risk Goods Ghana classifies some imports as “high risk goods” (HRGs) that must be inspected to ensure they meet Ghanaian or international standards. Since January 2019, the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) ceded its responsibility of verifying a certificate of analysis or a certificate of conformance at Ghanaian ports to Bureau Veritas and Intertek. Under a process called the EasyPASS Program, either Bureau Veritas or Intertek, after satisfactory verification, issues an EasyPASS Certificate (certificate of conformity), which is used to facilitate customs clearance. While exporters pay fees ranging from 0.35 percent to 0.50 percent of the FOB to Bureau Veritas or Intertek; importers in Ghana are required to register with the GSA and pay an annual registration fee, ranging from $20 to $4,000, depending on the type of products they import. Upon arrival of goods at a port in Ghana, the GSA checks the validity of the EasyPASS Certificate before releasing a consignment for clearance. The GSA classifies these HRGs into 11 broad groups (reduced from 20 in 2019 after ceding the inspection of food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical and household chemical products to the Ghanaian Food and Drugs Authority (FDA Ghana)), including toys, sports equipment, electrical appliances, and chemical products. Stakeholders have found this classification system vague and confusing. According to GSA officials, they classify these imports as high risk because they pose “potential hazards,” although that phrase remains undefined in law or regulation. Food Products FDA Ghana ensures that all food products comply with the GSA General Labelling Rules, which include food expiration and shelf-life dates. Prepackaged foods to be imported for distribution or sale for local consumption must have at least two-thirds of their shelf-life intact at the time of clearance from the port of entry. Goods that do not meet shelf-life requirements are rejected and must be re-exported or destroyed under the supervision of FDA Ghana at the expense of the importer. The United States has asked for clarification regarding the requirement’s legitimate objective. Automobile Policy and Standards In December 2019, Ghana also established compulsory vehicle safety and emissions standards for both imported and locally-produced vehicles. Ghana’s standards were modeled broadly on the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) 1958 Agreement automobile standards. The GSA noted in the issued standards that it would accept and publish other applicable standards not listed as an amendment or revision after the establishment of their equivalence to the Ghana standards. Following U.S. advocacy with Ghana, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the GSA incorporated amendments to include U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards self-certification and documentation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Effective January 1, 2021, all vehicle importers are required to register with the GSA and present a motor vehicle emissions report, a road worthiness test report from an agency approved by the GSA, and a certificate of conformity. In early 2022, Ghana notified the WTO of a new set of standards, a required vehicle safety inspection upon arrival, and other requirements specifically for used vehicles. As of December 31, 2024, Ghana had not published a list of the accredited bodies and vehicle dealerships for certification to these new requirements. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-174-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 167 Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Ghana prohibits the importation of meat with a fat content by weight greater than 25 percent for beef, 25 percent for pork, 25 percent for mutton, and 15 percent for poultry. The United States continues to engage with Ghana on these import requirements and to urge Ghana to use science- and risk-based approaches to regulate these products. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT U.S. suppliers of goods and services face difficulties accessing the Ghanaian procurement market. Ghana’s procurements are often awarded on a sole-source basis and lack clear timeframes and procedures. Guidelines that apply to current tenders open to international competitive bidding give a margin of preference of 7.5 percent to 20.0 percent to domestic suppliers of goods and services. On July 3, 2020, the Ghanaian Government issued a directive to public institutions to provide preferential treatment for the procurement of locally assembled vehicles. Despite the public procurement law, companies report that locally funded contracts lack full transparency. Foreign government–subsidized financing arrangements appear in some cases to be a crucial factor in the award of government procurements. Allegations of corruption persist in the tender processes across ministries. Ghana is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Ghana is a member of many intellectual property (IP) treaties. Ghana has taken steps to update its IP laws, including by ratifying the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) Arusha Protocol for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants in 2023. The Protocol came into force on November 24, 2024. Government officials periodically inspect import shipments and conduct raids on physical markets for counterfeit and pirated goods. However, concerns remain that IP enforcement activity is weak, and unreasonable delays in infringement proceedings discourage right holders from filing new claims in local courts. Small and medium-sized enterprises, including financial technology and payment companies, have expressed frustration with Ghana’s IP environment, especially with respect to IP theft. In addition, more public education on IP is needed. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Ghana limits foreign participation in several sectors, including telecommunications, banking, fishing, mining, petroleum, and real estate. Foreign investors have expressed concerns about respect for contract sanctity in Ghana, including threats to abrogate contracts, unilateral changes to contract terms, and forced contract renegotiations with the government and its state-owned enterprises. As a result of these contract- related issues, as of December 31, 2024, U.S. companies face several hundred million dollars in payment arrears from the Government of Ghana and government-affiliated entities. These concerns have undermined confidence in Ghana’s investment climate. Mining Pursuant to the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006, foreign investors are restricted from obtaining a small- scale mining license for mining operations of an area less than or equal to 25 acres (10 hectares). Non- Ghanaians may apply for industrial mineral rights only for projects involving an investment of at least $10 million. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-175-2048.jpg) ![168 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS The Minerals and Mining Act mandates compulsory local participation, through which the government acquires a 10 percent equity stake in ventures at no cost. In order to qualify for a mineral license, a non- Ghanaian company must be registered in Ghana, either as a branch office or a subsidiary incorporated under the Companies Act, 2019, or the Private Partnership Act, 2020. Oil and Gas The oil and gas sector is subject to a variety of state ownership and local content requirements. The 2016 Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act mandates local participation. All entities seeking petroleum exploration and development licenses in Ghana must create a consortium in which the state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) holds a minimum 15 percent participating carried interest and a local Ghanaian firm or individual holds a minimum 5 percent interest. The GNPC has the option to acquire an additional participating interest as determined in the petroleum agreement. The interest of the local Ghanaian firm is not transferable to a foreign company. The Petroleum Commission issues all licenses, but exploration licenses require additional approval by Parliament. Regulations specify in-country sourcing requirements with respect to goods, services, hiring, and training associated with petroleum operations––standards that many international companies describe as unattainable. These regulations also require mandatory local equity participation for all suppliers and contractors. The Minister of Energy must approve all contracts, subcontracts, and purchase orders above $100,000 and has the authority to alter the requirements set by law for any specific contract. The criteria for the Minister’s approval of local equity partners in commercial transactions remain unclear, which raises concerns of potential corruption and favoritism in the selection of local equity partners in government- approved concessions or contracts. Noncompliance with these regulations may result in a criminal penalty, including imprisonment for up to five years. The Petroleum Commission applies registration fees and annual renewal fees on foreign oil and gas service providers, which, depending on a company’s annual revenue, range from $70,000 to $150,000, compared to fees of $5,000 to $30,000 for local companies. OTHER BARRIERS Ghana Shippers’ Authority Law Parliament passed the Ghana Shippers’ Authority (GSA) bill on July 29, 2024 and was signed by the President on October 18, 2024. The bill gives the Minister of Transport the power to regulate local participation in the provision of shipping services in the country, among other powers. Additionally, the bill requires the GSA to approve shipping service provider fees. Export Ban Since 2013, Ghana has banned the exportation of ferrous scrap metals. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-176-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 169 GUATEMALA TRADE AGREEMENTS Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement The Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA–DR) entered into force for the United States and El Salvador on March 1, 2006, for Honduras and Nicaragua on April 1, 2006, for Guatemala on July 1, 2006, for the Dominican Republic on March 1, 2007, and for Costa Rica on January 1, 2009. The United States and the other CAFTA–DR countries meet regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the Agreement and to address outstanding issues. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs As a member of the Central American Common Market, Guatemala applies a harmonized external tariff on most items at a maximum of 15 percent, with some exceptions. However, under the CAFTA–DR, as of January 1, 2015, U.S. non-agricultural goods enter Guatemala duty free. In addition, nearly all U.S. agricultural exports enter Guatemala duty free under the CAFTA–DR. Guatemala eliminated its tariffs on rice on January 1, 2023 and eliminated tariffs on dairy products on January 1, 2025. For certain agricultural products, tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) permit duty-free access for specified quantities during a tariff phaseout period, with the duty-free quantities expanding during that period. Guatemala will liberalize trade in white corn through continual expansion of a TRQ, rather than the reduction of the out-of-quota tariff. Guatemala is required under the CAFTA–DR to make TRQs available on January 1 of each year. Guatemala monitors its TRQs through an import licensing system, which the United States carefully tracks to ensure the timely issuance of these permits. Taxes Guatemalan tax law requires that some companies that purchase goods and services from other companies withhold 15 percent of the value-added tax (VAT) paid and seek refunds for the VAT credit that they cannot offset after two years. This process is onerous and timely refunds are not guaranteed. Non-Tariff Barriers Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation U.S. companies have raised concerns that Guatemala’s Tax Authority (SAT) uses an inaccurate reference price database to determine the value of imported goods, erroneously applies database values as minimums rather than as a reference, and compares imports to dissimilar products in the database. Furthermore, when SAT performs investigations of declared values, the review process often results in the detention of the imported product for 20 days or more. Appeals involve a lengthy, opaque process that has lasted up to four years in some cases. In 2022, the U.S. Government engaged with the Guatemalan Government to help introduce an automated system to provide more transparency and help clear shipments more quickly on bond. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-177-2048.jpg) ![170 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Guatemala requires product registration for food products (e.g., dairy products) from every importer, as well as for animal feed and pet food. Importers are required to submit necessary documents to the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance and receive approval before products are sold into the market, even if another importer has already registered that product. Stakeholders have raised concerns that the process is burdensome and can delay the importation process by months. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers In response to a U.S. Government request for more transparent quarantine protocols at ports, in 2021 the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA) published Ministerial Decree 57-2021, which establishes official quarantine protocols for plant and animal health. In addition, in response to industry complaints that quarantine inspections break the cold chain, the Intraregional Organization for Plant and Animal Health (OIRSA), to which the MAGA delegates quarantine inspection and fumigation services, now also conducts inspections within refrigerated spaces at Quetzal Port. OIRSA also authorized construction of a cold room within Santo Tomas Port, which became operational in 2023. OIRSA’s continued inspection of all imported fresh produce causes delays, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has asked the MAGA to establish a risk-based inspection system. Guatemala approved a science-based agricultural biotechnology regulation for genetically engineered plants in 2019, harmonizing its regulation with Honduras and El Salvador under the Central American Integration System. Companies started submitting requests in 2021, with two approvals granted in that same year. However, since March 2022, the MAGA has refused to receive or process any further applications, despite repeated requests from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and Guatemalan industries to resume the authorization process. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Government institutions have been required to use the electronic government procurement system, GUATECOMPRAS, to track Guatemalan Government procurement processes since March 2004. Although GUATECOMPRAS initially improved the efficiency and transparency of government tendering processes, U.S. suppliers have expressed reluctance to bid on Guatemalan public procurement tenders because of corruption in procurement. In addition, foreign suppliers must appoint a national representative to represent the interest of the company in Guatemala. Guatemala is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. Guatemala has binding international procurement obligations under the CAFTA–DR. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Guatemala remained on the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report.

Other concerns include the sale of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and government use of unlicensed software. Major cable television providers and content distributors agreed in 2018 not to renew contracts to rebroadcast U.S. network signals due to signal piracy of U.S. broadcasted networks. However, cable signal piracy remains a problem, and online piracy through Internet Protocol Television services is also a concern. The United States continues to urge Guatemala to ensure that its IP enforcement agencies receive sufficient resources and to strengthen enforcement, including with respect to criminal prosecution, administrative and border actions, and intergovernmental coordination to address widespread copyright piracy and commercial-scale sales of counterfeit goods. The United States will continue to engage Guatemala on these and other concerns, including through the Special 301 process, and will continue to monitor Guatemala’s implementation of its IP obligations under the CAFTA–DR. SERVICES BARRIERS Professional Services Foreign enterprises may provide licensed professional services in Guatemala only through a contract or other relationship with an enterprise established in Guatemala. Additionally, public notaries must be Guatemalan nationals. INVESTMENT BARRIERS A number of U.S. companies operating in Guatemala complain that complex and unclear laws and regulations and inconsistent judicial decisions effectively operate as barriers to investment. LABOR The U.S. labor enforcement case brought against Guatemala under Article 16.2.1(a) of the CAFTA–DR was formally concluded in 2017 with the issuance of the panel’s final report. Nevertheless, labor concerns—including with respect to the right of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, and acceptable conditions of work––persist in the port, agriculture, apparel, and agricultural processing sectors and the U.S. Government continues to engage Guatemala. OTHER BARRIERS Bribery and Corruption The CAFTA–DR contains public sector anti-bribery commitments and anticorruption measures in government contracting, designed to ensure that U.S. firms are guaranteed a fair and transparent process to sell goods and services to a wide range of government entities. U.S. stakeholders have expressed concerns that corruption in Guatemala constrains investment. For instance, the Ministry of Governance in Guatemala, which is responsible for security at ports, airports, and land borders in Guatemala, operates two security units known as DIPAFRONT (Division of Ports, Airports, and Border Posts) and SGAIA (General Subdirectorate of Narcotics Analysis and Information) that have responsibility for secondary inspections at ports if security-related issues are suspected. A separate United Nations program, the UCC (Container Control Unit) also operates security-related programs. These units operate independently from the other operating authorities at ports, such as the MAGA and Guatemala’s Customs authority, which have memoranda of understanding to carry out joint inspections. In response to a U.S. Coast Guard requirement, Guatemalan exports to the United States must pass inspection by at least ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-179-2048.jpg) ![172 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS one of the three security-related units (DIPAFRONT, SGAIA, or UCC).

Kuwait’s exceptions include 417 basic foodstuffs, agricultural, medical, and pharmaceutical items that are exempt from customs duties. Qatar’s exceptions include more than 800 goods, including certain food staples, some pharmaceuticals, and specific machine parts. Pork, tobacco, and alcohol are subject to a 100 percent tariff. Urea and ammonia are subject to a 30 percent tariff, steel and iron to a 20 percent tariff, and musical instruments to a 15 percent tariff. Saudi Arabia’s applied tariff rates range from 6.5 percent to 40.0 percent on goods that compete with domestic industries. In June 2022, Saudi Arabia’s Zakat, Tax, and Customs Authority increased customs duties on 99 products, primarily foodstuffs, beverages, and industrial and agricultural products. The increased tariff rates range from 5.5 percent to 25.0 percent. Since July 2021, preferential market access under the GCC tariff agreements no longer applies to goods made in free trade zones or using Israeli inputs. The UAE’s exceptions include 811 items that are exempt from customs duties, including imports by philanthropic societies and the diplomatic corps, military goods, personal goods, used household items, gifts, and returned goods. Taxes In 2016, GCC Member States agreed to introduce common GCC excise taxes on products including carbonated drinks (50 percent). U.S. beverage producers report that the excise tax structure for carbonated drinks, which also applies to sugar-free carbonated beverages but exempts GCC manufactured sugary juices, disadvantages U.S. products, and fails to address public health concerns. Kuwait introduced legislation to implement the common GCC excise taxes in the National Assembly in 2018. It remained under debate until the Amir suspended the National Assembly on May 10, 2024, for up to four years. Oman implemented the common GCC excise taxes, as well as a 100 percent tax on pork and tobacco products in 2019. Qatar implemented the common GCC excise taxes in January 2019. The UAE implemented the common GCC excise taxes in October 2017. U.S. industry continues to seek reimbursement for claims related to the UAE’s value-added tax (VAT) on goods and services dating back to January 2019. U.S. defense contractors are exempt from the five percent VAT on goods and services provided to the U.S. military in the UAE, as stipulated in the bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement.

Per the Federal Tax Authority database, all future reimbursements will be made quarterly according to a bilaterally approved list that will be updated annually. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans and Restrictions Kuwait prohibits the importation of a range of goods, including used medical equipment, automobiles more than ten years old, and products containing alcohol or pork. In 2023, Oman banned the import of single use plastic bags. Media imports to Oman are subject to government censorship for morally or politically sensitive material. The Ministry of Information delays or bars publications of content it deems morally suspect or politically sensitive. Saudi Arabia prohibits the importation of 37 categories of products, including alcohol and pork products. The UAE bans the importation of controlled, recreational drugs and narcotic substances; items used in black magic, witchcraft or sorcery; publications and artwork that contradict or challenge Islamic teachings and values; and gambling tools and machines. In June 2024, the UAE Government clarified that importing gambling tools and machines would be allowed via licensed vendors; however, as of December 31, 2024, new regulations had not yet been released to reflect this update despite the issuance of the first commercial gaming license in October 2024. Import Licensing Kuwait maintains an import licensing regime for a wide variety of products. Importers of products subject to import licensing must be citizens of Kuwait or be Kuwait-based brokers and are required to register with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In Oman, importers of food and agricultural commodities are required to obtain an import permit prior to shipping the product from the country of origin. Companies must obtain a special license for the importation of certain products, including alcohol, livestock, and poultry. The process of obtaining a license can be complicated, significantly adding to the time it takes to import goods. Qatar requires an import license for the importation of most products, mainly livestock, plants, and fish products that fall under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Municipality. The Qatari Government issues import licenses to Qatari citizens, Qatari partners in limited liability companies, and to foreign-owned entities operating in Qatar that are registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Only authorized local agents of foreign firms are allowed to import goods produced by the firms they represent. In the telecommunications sector, commercially registered companies in Qatar can import telecommunications equipment by obtaining an Import Authorization License from the Communications Regulatory Authority. The Qatar Distribution Company, a subsidiary of the national air carrier Qatar Airways, has sole authority to import pork and alcohol. Saudi Arabia requires special approval for the importation of 23 categories of restricted products, including agricultural seeds and wireless communications equipment. In the UAE, only UAE-registered companies can obtain licenses to import goods. This licensing requirement does not apply to goods imported into free trade zones. Importation of certain goods for personal consumption also does not require an import license. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-183-2048.jpg) ![176 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Import Documentation Requirements In order to clear goods from customs zones at air and seaports in Qatar, importers must submit a detailed customs declaration, a bill of lading, a certificate of origin, a pro forma invoice, and an import license. The Qatari Embassy, a Qatari consulate, or the Qatari Chamber of Commerce in the United States must authenticate import documentation for U.S.-origin imports. This consularization process, or authentication requirement, is the kind of unnecessary burden that the United States seeks to eliminate. Qatar’s customs authority charges a fine of one percent on the shipment value if the invoice is not legalized by the Qatari Chamber of Commerce in the country of origin of the exported products. Imported agricultural products require different certificates depending on the category of the product. Meat, fish, eggs, livestock, live poultry, grains, animal feed, and planting seeds require an original health certificate. All processed or shelf- stable foods exported from the United States to Qatar require a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Certificate to a Foreign Government. Industry representatives have also complained about the limited transparency of changes to Qatar’s customs procedures, particularly the lag in Arabic to English translation of updated regulations. The UAE requires that documentation for all non-agricultural products imported from the United States be authenticated by the Embassy of the UAE in the United States, including delivery orders from the shipping or line agents, original supplier commercial invoices, certificates of origin, and packing lists. Stakeholders report that this “consularization” requirement is burdensome and costly. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Companies importing U.S. goods into Oman occasionally report difficulties in demonstrating eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under the FTA for goods that enter Oman over land via the UAE. The Royal Oman Police Customs Directorate inconsistently applies requirements for origin marking, segregation of FTA cargo, and other documentation. Kuwait notified its customs valuation legislation to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2017, but has not yet responded to the WTO Checklist of Issues describing how the Customs Valuation Agreement is being implemented. Kuwait ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in April 2018. Kuwait has not yet submitted four transparency notifications related to: (1) import, export, and transit regulations; (2) the use of customs brokers; (3) customs contact points for the exchange of information; and (4) details on the operation of the single window. The first two notifications were due to the WTO on February 22, 2017, and the remaining two notifications were due to the WTO on June 30, 2022, according to Kuwait’s self-designated TFA implementation schedule. Qatar ratified the WTO TFA in June 2017. On October 17, 2024, Qatar submitted the transparency notifications required by the TFA related to: (1) import, export, and transit regulations; (2) details on the operation of the single window; (3) the use of customs brokers; and (4) customs contact points for the exchange of information.

Kuwait rejects food shipments with certificate of free sale issued by U.S. states unless they contain a statement that the product is “fit for human consumption.” Over the years, Saudi Arabia has revised technical regulations for a variety of products to reflect a preference for standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission. Saudi Arabia has been increasingly reluctant to accept other international standards that may meet or exceed Saudi Arabia’s regulatory objectives, including those developed by U.S.-domiciled organizations through open, transparent, and consensus-based processes. Saudi Arabia’s refusal to accept these other international standards, which are often used by U.S. manufacturers, creates significant market access restrictions for certain industrial and consumer products exported from the United States, including protective footwear, automobiles, electrical equipment, and appliances. The United States continues to encourage Saudi Arabia to develop and implement effective mechanisms for stakeholder consultation in regulatory decision-making to help ensure that interested parties have opportunities to provide comments on draft regulations and to provide reasonable time for those comments to be considered. U.S. manufacturers have noted the importance of such consultations as Saudi Arabia develops and implements Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations, as well as new energy efficiency regulations for a variety of consumer and industrial products, including air conditioners, electrical appliances, lighting, electrical motors, energy usage intensity, tires, and insulation. Automobiles U.S. automakers have raised concerns over growing regulatory fragmentation in the GCC. While the Gulf Standardization Organization (GSO) is supposed to set standards for the entire GCC market, individual GCC Member States have instituted unique standards for automobiles that deviate from GCC automobile standards. The United States monitors this issue across GCC Member States. While Saudi Arabia has historically accepted automobiles built to conform to either U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) 1958 Agreement regulations, Saudi Arabia has taken steps toward solely adopting UNECE regulations. For example, Saudi Arabia adopted a UNECE low rolling resistance tire regulation that effectively excludes tires needed for certain U.S. sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks sold in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia’s new electric vehicle certification likewise is based only on UNECE regulations. U.S. automakers have raised concerns that potential changes to GSO automobile safety standards could result in GCC Member States solely adopting UNECE regulations which may ultimately lead to reduced sales of certain vehicle types in the GCC, the world’s third largest export market for U.S. automakers. While Saudi Arabia has largely adopted U.S. CAFE standards, the country’s draft CAFE regulation does not contain certain flexibilities used in the U.S. program, which may ultimately lead to reduced sales of certain vehicle types in Saudi Arabia, one of the largest export markets for U.S. automakers. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-185-2048.jpg) ![178 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS U.S. automakers also raised concerns about implementation challenges of the UAE Emergency Call (eCall) and Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB+) requirements. The UAE requires full integration of DAB+ radio, an expensive feature, but the UAE does not have any active DAB+ broadcast stations. The UAE also has its own electric vehicle regulations, including new local certification requirements, which are not consistent with regulations developed by the GSO. Conformity Assessment Procedures on Hazardous Substances – Electrical Goods In March 2018, GCC Member States notified the WTO of a draft GSO technical regulation that would establish the rules for the conformity assessment of certain hazardous substances in electrical goods. The measure deviates significantly from common international practice, which typically requires a supplier’s declaration of conformity, by requiring pre-market third-party conformity assessment, and certification from a list of approved accredited bodies. The draft regulation also requires each type of good to be registered annually with the GSO. The United States raised concerns that the proposed GCC regulatory requirements establish procedural requirements that are far more burdensome and costly than other markets regulating the same goods and may dissuade U.S. producers of these products from exporting to the region. The draft regulation has not yet entered into force, and does not make clear whether all of the GCC Member States would accept a single test result or how the measure would be transposed and applied across all Member States. Saudi Arabia notified to the WTO its draft Technical Regulation for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in December 2020, and subsequently published a revised version in the Official Gazette in July 2021. The regulation took effect for small household electrical items on July 4, 2022; implementation for other covered products will follow at scheduled intervals. A revised version of the regulation, published on July 29, 2022, offered additional flexibilities but does not fully address concerns outlined in detailed comments from the U.S. Government and U.S. industry, or similar comments from other trading partners and global industry. In 2023, the United States sought additional information from Saudi Arabia regarding the precise scope of the regulation, guidance on the process for testing whole equipment and critical components of a product, and clarity on the requirement for suppliers to attach information that may include confidential business information as a part of their technical file of supporting documentation. Subsequent guidance issued for the regulation has provided some flexibility in the ability of producers to satisfy certification requirements by submitting a supplier’s declaration of conformity (SDoC), though it remains unclear whether these flexibilities will be afforded to all importers or only to manufacturers and their legal representatives. Conformity Assessment and Marking Requirements The Emirates Conformity Assessment Scheme (ECAS) monitors industry compliance with UAE standards for goods to be sold in the country. The ECAS, initially notified to the WTO in 2004, applies to items such as textiles, building materials, energy drinks, dairy, juice, honey, and organic products. In addition, obtaining the Emirates Quality Mark (EQM) is mandatory for bottled drinking water, natural mineral water, and ice for human consumption. The application of ECAS and EQM to these items duplicates the regulatory system overseen by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment In 2018, Saudi Arabia implemented the Saudi Product Safety Program and launched an online certification and conformity assessment process (Saber) for all imported goods entering Saudi Arabia. Saber covers both regulated and unregulated products. Importers of regulated products must use Saber to initiate a certification request. If the product receives a Product Certificate of Conformity (PCoC), the importer is then issued a Shipment Certificate of Conformity (SCoC). Products requiring PCoCs include, but are not limited to: detergents, building materials, paints, vehicle spare parts, lubricant oils, toys, and textiles.

Following this self-declaration, the importer will be issued a Requester Declaration (S-DoC). An increasing number of U.S. companies have expressed concerns with the new Saber platform, including undue delays, and inconsistencies in product testing fees and clearance processes. The United States has also asked for clarification from Saudi Arabia on how the program relates to GCC conformity assessment requirements. Halal Regulations In 2020, GCC Member States notified the WTO of a draft GSO technical regulation establishing halal requirements and certification for animal feed. The U.S. animal feed, beef, and poultry industries have raised concerns that the technical regulation places additional requirements on U.S. suppliers without offering additional assurance of compliance. The United States has raised concerns with GCC Member States, noting the unprecedented and potentially trade restrictive nature of the measure. Each GCC Member State implements halal measures differently. In 2024, Kuwait’s Public Authority for Food and Nutrition updated the requirements for halal certifiers eligible to certify products for export to Kuwait. A halal certifier can be listed on Kuwait’s approved list of certifiers if the certifier received approval from either the Gulf Accreditation Center plus one GCC country or from at least two GCC countries. Previously, halal certifiers only needed an approval from at least one GCC country. The new requirements resulted in the delisting of some U.S. halal certifiers. The certificate also must be endorsed by a Kuwaiti Embassy or Consulate. In October 2022, Qatar expanded application of its halal certification requirement to animal feed, slaughterhouses, handling, packaging, storing, and food additives. A halal certificate from an approved halal certifier is required for any product of animal origin, or its ingredients, imported from non-Islamic countries. This includes products such as gelatin and food additives of animal origin like lecithin and emulsifier (E471, e472) or a product containing rennet, an animal-derived enzyme. It is also advised to avoid using words or expressions that may give the impression that a food product or some of its ingredients are not halal; a list of these common words is available online. Saudi Arabia suspended imports of U.S. poultry in June 2018 after enforcing halal regulations that ban stunning of poultry prior to slaughter. In 2019, several other trading partners with similar production practices resumed exports to Saudi Arabia, while imports from the United States remain prohibited. U.S. officials informed Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) officials that the U.S. production system and government regulations ensured that poultry is alive prior to the slaughter process and explained how the stunning process immobilizes birds to ensure that the slaughtering process is humane and effective. Saudi Arabia also maintains halal feed restrictions for imports of meat products from the United States, including a ban on animal protein in cattle feed and restrictions on the feeding of beef tallow to cattle, which limit U.S. beef exports to Saudi Arabia. On September 4, 2024, SFDA’s Halal Center, which handles halal certification and accreditation, informed global halal certifying bodies that, effective October 1, 2024, no imports of halal-certified products would be allowed into Saudi Arabia without a new SFDA-issued halal certificate. The certificate can be obtained on a web-based halal portal through the registration of facilities and products by approved halal certifying bodies. Saudi Arabia has not notified this measure to the WTO. Representatives from SFDA’s Halal Center have met with the U.S. officials and industry representatives regarding concerns about technical difficulties using the registration system. At least one U.S. Halal certification body has reported progress in registering its clients in the system. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-187-2048.jpg) ![180 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS In November 2022, the UAE updated halal slaughtering requirements to allow for poultry stunning that does not directly result in death of the animal. The UAE has declined to renew accreditation for several U.S. halal certifying bodies, despite these certifiers having undergone successful onsite audits as part of their accreditation process in 2024. In separate meetings with these halal certifying bodies and U.S. Government officials, UAE officials have cited “administrative reasons” for not renewing their accreditation without providing additional clarity or information on their actions. Energy Drinks In January 2016, GCC Member States notified to the WTO a draft GSO technical regulation for energy drinks, which was revised in March 2022. The U.S. Government and private sector stakeholders raised concerns through bilateral and multilateral fora regarding the draft regulation. Industry stakeholders still report that caffeine-content limitations unduly target energy drinks in GCC Member States. In many cases, such limitations do not apply to other drink products that contain similar or even higher levels of caffeine, such as tea, brewed coffee and other ready-to-drink coffee products. In September 2021, Bahrain began to implement Executive Regulations for the Public Health Law on Energy Drinks. These regulations prohibit the sale of energy drinks in restaurants, cafeterias, educational facilities, and health facilities and require prior licensing in order to advertise such products through any form of media. Dairy Regulations In June 2019, Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health released a Council of Ministers’ circular on both imported and domestically-produced dairy products that implement limited shelf-life requirements on long-life milk and white cheeses. Qatar did not notify the WTO of this regulation prior to implementation. The U.S. Government pressed Qatar on concerning aspects of its regulation in bilateral discussions and at meetings of the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade. In August 2021 and May 2022, the Ministry issued further updates to the June 2019 regulation that expanded its scope, increasing the concerns of the U.S. dairy industry. Qatar again failed to notify the WTO of the new regulation prior to its implementation. The U.S. Government and private sector stakeholders continue to raise concerns with Qatar on this regulation, including the transparency of its implementation and the food safety and food quality rationale of the measure. Food Registration Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health requires food commodities that fall under its jurisdiction to be registered through the online Watheq system in order to confirm that the products comply with Qatar’s food standards and regulations. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Kuwait does not use a risk management system for clearing food shipments for import, instead requiring customs authorities to inspect every food shipment before being cleared for entry into Kuwait. This process can add several days to the delivery time, reduce the longevity of the food, and increase costs. Kuwait has not notified the WTO of Ministerial Decree 6/2023, issued in May 2023, updating regulations for imported food, despite the United States and other trading partners officially requesting that the Kuwaiti Government notify the WTO, delay the implementation date, and allow WTO members to submit comments. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-188-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 181 Agricultural stakeholders have raised concerns regarding Oman’s import requirements involving certification for pesticide residues as well as radiation attestations for agricultural products. The companies assert that these regulations provide restrictive controls that do not necessarily further the goal of protecting human and animal health. Zoning and Compartmentalization The World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) standards on zoning and compartmentalization provide recommendations for safe international trade between countries. Despite following WOAH guidelines for zoning or compartmentalization in most cases, Saudi Arabia does not recognize the existence of United States zones or compartments in the event that highly pathogenic avian influenza occurs within the United States. The United States continues to press Saudi Arabia to act consistently with WOAH guidelines. Maximum Residue Limits Approximation Saudi Arabia generally follows the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) for maximum residue limits (MRL) for pesticides applicable to grains and horticultural products. However, in the absence of a Codex MRL limit, Saudi Arabia applies MRLs based on EU regulations that are not necessarily based on science- based decision-making and, as a result, could impede U.S. trade. Facility Listing Requirements In 2021, Saudi Arabia notified the WTO of new requirements related to pre-export approval for multiple products, including animal and dairy products, grains, and processed vegetables. Saudi Arabia implemented the requirements for honey and seafood products in November 2021; the U.S. and Saudi Governments continue to engage on requirements for seafood products. Saudi Arabia’s pre-export approval process requires attestation by the competent authorities in the exporting country that the product meets the requirements in Saudi regulations, as well as an audit of facilities. Firms or relevant government agencies in the exporting country are required to pay related travel expenses for the audits. As U.S. competent authorities lack the legal authority to attest to compliance with foreign government regulations, U.S. Government agencies continue to work with SFDA to confirm that specific U.S. facilities meet the requirements of the 2021 regulation. Agricultural Biotechnology In May 2020, the UAE issued Federal Law No. 9 regarding the biosafety of agricultural biotechnology products. The law prohibits the import, export, re-export, transit, production, and circulation of any agricultural products with biotechnology content of equal to or higher than 0.9 percent. For agricultural products with biotechnology content less than this threshold, a permit is required. UAE Resolution No. 84 of 2022 regarding the executive bylaws for Federal Law No. 9 of 2020 regarding the biological safety of genetically engineered commodities and their products places several restrictions, requirements, and specifications for the import, transport, circulation, and re-export of such products. Certification In 2021, Saudi Arabia began implementation of new regulations that require trading partners to adopt model certificates. The United States has requested Saudi authorities to accept comparable certifications currently issued by the U.S. competent authorities but as of December 31, 2024, they had not yet done so. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-189-2048.jpg) ![182 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Titanium Dioxide In May 2022, GCC Member States notified to the WTO an amendment to the GSO technical regulations on Additives Permitted for Use in Foodstuffs that bans the use of titanium dioxide as a food additive, in line with EU food additive regulations. Titanium dioxide is an adopted food additive that is included in the Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA). As such, it may be used in specified foods under the conditions of good manufacturing practices as outlined in the Codex GSFA. The FDA continues to allow for the safe use of titanium dioxide as a color additive in foods, subject to certain restrictions, including that the quantity of titanium dioxide does not exceed one percent in weight of the food. In November 2023, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), confirmed a reevaluation of titanium dioxide and concluded that there is no safety concern or risk associated with the use of the substance as a food additive. The United States has requested that the GCC Member States allow the use of titanium dioxide based on Codex, justified by science and consistent with the recent JECFA conclusion. In July 2023, Oman banned the production, import, and marketing of food products that contain titanium dioxide and established a fine of $2,600 for violations. The fine is doubled in the event of a repeat offense. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT The United States–Bahrain FTA contains disciplines on government procurement. Some U.S. companies report that they have faced prolonged issues with the tendering process related to GCC-funded projects. Bahrain is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since December 2008. Kuwait’s Public Tenders Law No. 49 of 2016 regulates government procurement and requires that any procurement with a value greater than KD 75,000 (approximately $250,000) be conducted through the Central Agency for Public Tenders. Certain contracts from the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation that exceed KD 5 million (approximately $16.6 million) are exempt. Ministries of Interior and Defense, National Guard, and core (i.e., drilling and extraction) Kuwait Petroleum Corporation contracts are also exempted. Kuwait provides a 15 percent price preference for domestic and GCC goods, and requires foreign contractors to purchase at least 30 percent of their inputs domestically and to subcontract at least 30 percent of the work to domestic contractors where available. Kuwait is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. The United States–Oman FTA contains disciplines on government procurement. Oman provides a 10 percent price preference to tenders that contain a high content of local goods or services, including direct employment of Omani nationals, as per its in-country value requirements. However, Oman may not apply such price preferences to bids offering goods and services from the United States in procurements covered by the United States–Oman FTA. For most major tenders, Oman invites bids from international firms or firms pre-selected by project consultants, but stakeholders report that in recent years Oman has favored local community contractors and Omani small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Suppliers are requested to be physically present at the opening of tenders and interested persons may view the process on Oman’s Tender Board website.

Oman is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since May 2001. Qatar’s Cabinet Decision 16/2019 stipulates that non-Qatari companies participating in tenders must utilize local goods and services equivalent to at least 30 percent of a tender’s value, including local raw materials, locally-manufactured goods, transportation services, security, guarding and catering services, or any other local services provided. Cabinet Decision 11/2022 additionally favors local SMEs, by exempting them from providing bonds when bidding for government tenders, incentivizing greater support for the local economy, and encouraging government clients to consider bidders’ in-country value ratios when evaluating bid prices. Participation in government tenders with a value of QAR 5,000,000 or less (equivalent to approximately $1.38 million) is limited to local SME contractors, suppliers, and merchants registered with the Qatar Chamber of Commerce. Qatar is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. Saudi Arabia requires foreign contractors to subcontract 30 percent of the value of any government procurement, including support services, to firms that are majority-owned by Saudi nationals. An exemption is granted when no Saudi-owned company can provide the goods or services necessary to fulfill the requirements of a tender. The Saudi Government is in the process of reforming its procurement processes and policies. In addition to offsets, the Saudi Government promotes purchases of goods and services in Saudi Arabia and increasing the percentage of Saudi nationals employed by foreign firms–a policy known as “Saudization.” The Saudi Government currently requires offsets in investments of up to 40 percent of a program’s value for defense procurement, depending on the value of the contract. Saudi Arabia provides a 10 percent price preference for GCC goods used in procurements in which foreign suppliers participate. Saudi Arabia revised its Government Tenders and Procurement Law in April 2020. The law regulates the contractual relationship between a public or government entity and contractors. U.S. companies have reported that the procurement systems lack transparency. In 2018, the Ministry of Finance launched the Electronic Government Procurement System (Etimad Portal) to consolidate and facilitate the procurement process for the public sector. The General Authority for Military Industries manages Saudi Arabia’s armaments procurement activities. U.S. companies have reported long delays and difficulties in Saudi Arabia in receiving payments for procurement contracts with national and regional government entities, with some delays lasting more than two years. Since late 2020, Saudi Arabia has prioritized timelier payments to contractors and uses the Etimad Portal to facilitate payments. U.S. companies continue to report significant payment delays in 2024, but report that the overall amounts owed to them are less than prior to the reform. In November 2022, Saudi Arabia announced its Economic Participation Policy, which requires foreign companies participating in local tenders above SAR100 million (approximately $26.3 million) to demonstrate an economic contribution to the Kingdom of at least 35 percent of the tender’s total value. Since January 1, 2024 all international companies must establish a regional headquarters (RHQ) in Saudi Arabia or be barred from bidding on government contracts. Companies bidding on contracts with a cumulative annual value of less than $266,000 are exempt from this requirement. Key concerns for U.S. companies regarding the RHQ policy include: the absence of a regulatory/legislative text outlining the ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-191-2048.jpg) ![184 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS policy parameters; a lack of clarity on the rights and obligations associated with the RHQ; and a lack of clarity or predictability on the tax regime for RHQs. International companies can obtain RHQ licenses through the Ministry of Investment's (MISA) “Invest Saudi” website. To be considered an RHQ, a company’s Saudi branch must conduct strategic and management functions including budgeting, business planning, regional strategy reviews, regional market monitoring and operational and financial reporting. An RHQ must have a minimum of 15 full-time employees within its first year of operation, including at least three senior executives. The Saudi Government may award contracts to sole-source technology or intellectual property providers without RHQs. A non-RHQ company can also be awarded a tender if its bid is at least 25 percent less than an RHQ company’s proposal. Contracts for projects outside of Saudi Arabia are not subject to the RHQ policy. It remains unclear whether other Saudi government entities that do not utilize the Etimad Portal, such as the General Authority for Military Industries, will apply the RHQ policy to their contracting decisions. According to the MISA, the RHQ policy applies to a company that submits a bid but had not signed a procurement contract by January 1, 2024. The United States has been actively engaged on this issue and continues to press for more clarity regarding this regulation. In September 2019, the Saudi Government issued a royal decree prohibiting government agencies from granting contracts to foreign consultancy firms, except in circumstances where there are no qualified Saudi alternatives. However, because the royal decree does not define the criteria for exemptions, and does not clarify whether local branches of foreign-owned firms are covered by the prohibition, it remains subject to interpretation. MISA issues consultancy licenses on a case-by-case basis. Saudi Arabia is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since December 2007. U.S. companies have raised concerns regarding a lack of transparency in the UAE’s government procurement processes, in addition to lengthy delays and burdensome procedures to receive payment. In March 2022, the UAE Ministry of Economy announced a revised UAE National Program for Emirati SMEs, which gives an advantage to Emirati-owned SMEs by providing them with several new incentives and preferential services, including: registration for federal government procurement tenders, provision of a range of business services from telecommunications to internal audits, and easier access to funding. Foreign defense contractors active in the UAE market continue to raise concerns about satisfying contractual obligations to enter into an agreement under the Tawazun Economic Program–referred to as an offset agreement. Despite recent reforms to the program, satisfying offset requirements in the UAE remains a challenge for U.S. defense contractors. In July 2020, the UAE established a national In Country Value (ICV) Program to expand local procurement preferences. In March 2021, the UAE revised the ICV Program as part of its ten-year comprehensive strategy, “Operation 300 Billion,” to promote UAE products. The UAE has expanded the ICV program to all seven emirates and several other government entities, bringing the total number of participants to 31 federal and local government entities. In February 2023, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company signed agreements worth $4.63 billion with 23 companies to locally manufacture materials and supplies for its operations. The number of companies that obtained ICV certificates reached 6,500 during the first half of 2024, an increase of 30 percent over the same period of 2023. U.S. firms have raised concerns that the UAE ICV Program is not transparent and that criteria change frequently. In November 2023, the UAE issued new regulations on federal government procurement with transparency requirements prescribing how federal entities may conduct procurement tenders including prohibiting employees from bidding on tenders from their federal entity and detecting and reporting ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-192-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 185 conflicts of interest. Some sectors, including defense, internal security, construction, medicine, and overseas operations, are exempt from the new regulations. The UAE is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION As part of its FTA obligations, Bahrain continues to enact laws to improve protection and enforcement of copyrights, trademarks, patents, and plant varieties. However, Bahrain has yet to accede to the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV 1991), as required under the FTA. Bahrain’s record on intellectual property (IP) enforcement is mixed. Over the past several years, Bahrain has launched several campaigns to block illegal broadcast signals and to prohibit the sale of decoding devices in order to combat piracy of cable and satellite television, and has launched several public awareness campaigns regarding copyright piracy. However, many counterfeit consumer goods continue to be sold openly. Oman committed in the FTA to provide strong IP protection and enforcement. Oman revised its IP laws and regulations to implement its FTA commitments and acceded to several international IP treaties. While IP laws in Oman are strong, the lack of IP enforcement capacity effectively places an additional burden on right holders to perform their own monitoring and enforcement through legal actions in the courts. Since its establishment in 2017, the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property (SAIP) has improved IP protection, enforcement, and awareness throughout the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia was removed from the Special 301 Report in 2022 after being placed on the Priority Watch List in 2019 due to inconsistencies in the application and enforcement of relevant IP laws in the pharmaceutical sector. Right holders continue to express concern regarding IP enforcement against counterfeit and pirated goods, citing a lack of transparency and information sharing throughout the complaint process and a lack of coordination between SAIP and other government entities, including SFDA. In 2021, the UAE was removed from the Special 301 Watch List after resolving concerns with IP protection of pharmaceutical products, making progress on long-standing IP enforcement issues, and increasing transparency with stakeholders. In 2023, the UAE adopted legislation to combat commercial fraud with significant penalties, and enforcement authorities launched several inspection campaigns targeting counterfeit goods. In 2024, the UAE launched its IP Ecosystem platform, with the aim of consolidating data from various government departments responsible for IP enforcement, providing a digital platform for receiving IP complaints, streamlining patent registration, and expediting trademark issuance within a single business day. However, the Deira District markets in Dubai remain in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List). In addition, entertainment industry stakeholders continue to press for the establishment of a collective management organization to enable the collection of music royalty payments. Right holders also continue to ask the UAE Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority to engage with domain name registrars and other intermediaries to facilitate effective enforcement actions against copyright infringement, encourage customs authorities to ban the importation of illegal set-top boxes, and put more restrictions on free or paid subscription-based services that unlawfully retransmit TV channels carrying copyright-protected content. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-193-2048.jpg) ![186 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS SERVICES BARRIERS Oman limits customs brokerage activities to Omani nationals. The United States has raised concerns about the consistency of this limitation with provisions of the FTA. Financial Services Foreign bank members of the Kuwait Banking Association may operate in Kuwait. However, foreign banks are subject to a maximum credit concentration limit equivalent to less than half of the largest local bank. Foreign banks may open representative offices but are prohibited from directing clients to borrow from external branches of their bank. Oman does not permit representative banking offices or offshore banking. Foreign banks established in Qatar are licensed by the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) or the Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA). The Qatari Government permits foreign banks licensed by QFCRA to establish a physical presence and conduct most types of banking business, including provision of shariah-compliant banking services, in the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC). These banks are not allowed to offer stand-alone retail banking services outside the QFC. In April 2021, the cabinet approved a draft law allowing foreign ownership of up to 100 percent in banks listed on Qatar Stock Exchange. Saudi Arabia limits foreign ownership in commercial banks to 60 percent of any individual bank, but investment banks and brokerages can be 100 percent foreign-owned. Although the UAE Central Bank allows foreign ownership up to 40 percent in national banks, the actual foreign ownership share is far lower. Foreign banks operating onshore are not allowed to open more than eight branches. Foreign banks are subject to a unique corporate income tax at the sub-federal emirate level. The emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah have long levied a 20 percent local income tax on foreign banks. In response to the new nine percent federal corporate income tax that went into effect on January 1, 2024, Dubai issued a law in March 2024 allowing foreign lenders to claim deductions from the local income tax on foreign banks for taxes paid under the new federal corporate income tax. Foreign banks established in Abu Dhabi and Sharjah are seeking similar treatment from local authorities. Entities licensed within the financial free zones remain exempt. Virtual Assets Since 2018, Qatar has banned all virtual assets due to the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing and potential harm to customers’ rights and interests. The QCB issued three circulars, the latest in March 2022, banning trading or dealing in virtual assets or currencies or in the tools that control them. In October 2023, the QFCRA and the QFC published a draft digital assets legislative framework, which was enacted on September 1, 2024, and includes new legislation governing permitted tokens, investment tokens, and token service providers. Cryptocurrencies remain banned. Insurance Services Qatar limits full foreign ownership in the insurance sector to 49 percent, unless otherwise approved by the Qatari Cabinet. Foreign insurance companies typically operate through branches and must adhere to regulations from both the QCB and the QFCRA. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-194-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 187 The UAE only allows foreign insurance companies to operate independently as branches. Foreign equity in domestic insurance companies is limited to 49 percent. As of May 2019, a resolution on regulations for reinsurance businesses requires that at least 51 percent of the capital of any insurance company incorporated in the UAE be owned by natural persons who are UAE or GCC nationals, or by legal persons fully owned by UAE or GCC nationals. However, a foreign reinsurance company may seek a license from the regulator to operate as a branch. In September 2020, the UAE Cabinet amended Council of Ministers Resolution No. 31 of 2019 to include onerous reporting requirements for foreign-owned financial firms, including banks, insurers, and purveyors of other financial products. Companies that are majority-owned by UAE nationals are exempt from these requirements. In November 2023, UAE federal law No. 48 on insurance entered into force to provide significant enforcement powers to the UAE Central Bank, to empower it to establish and enforce targets for employment of UAE nationals in the insurance sector, to prohibit UAE companies from doing business with unlicensed foreign insurers, and to stipulate required bank guarantees for foreign insurers. Telecommunications Services Although Kuwait’s telecommunications industry is technically open to private investment, in practice, the Kuwaiti Government maintains extensive ownership in the sector and controls licensing and infrastructure development. Kuwait’s telecommunications law gives authorities sweeping power to revoke licenses and block content with little judicial oversight. As of December 31, 2024, the Ministry of Communications was in the process of privatizing the terrestrial fiberoptics lines. Qatar restricts the provision of telecommunications services to locally licensed entities. Ooredoo and Vodafone Qatar are Qatar’s only licensed telecommunications service providers, and both are majority owned by government entities with some stakes owned by private shareholders. The UAE Government maintains majority ownership in e& and du, which are the only telecommunications service suppliers, Internet service providers, and mobile phone operators in the UAE. In January 2021, both telecommunications providers raised their foreign investment cap to 49 percent, though actual foreign ownership is 8.6 percent for e& and 1.4 percent for du. Professional Services Non-Omani attorneys, including U.S. attorneys practicing in Oman, are prohibited from appearing in courts of first instance. The United States has raised concerns about the consistency of this limitation with provisions of the FTA. In January 2021, Oman barred non-Omani attorneys from appearing or pleading in higher courts in Oman. Saudi Arabia requires that entities providing certain professional services have a Saudi partner, including engineering, accounting, architecture, healthcare, dental, and veterinary services. In general, the foreign entity’s equity in the joint venture cannot exceed 75 percent of the total investment. In order to avoid the equity cap, a 2017 measure requires foreign engineering consulting firms that are seeking to register a local branch or subsidiary to demonstrate that they have been incorporated for at least ten years and have operations in at least four different countries. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-195-2048.jpg) ![188 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Distribution Services Only Qatari individuals and domestically-licensed entities are allowed to serve as local commercial agents for foreign firms distributing products or services, except in certain sectors. The Minister of Commerce and Industry can waive the nationality requirement for commercial agents of foreign companies that have direct contracts with the Qatari Government. The UAE’s Federal Law No. 11 of 2020 amended the Commercial Agency Law No. 18 of 1981 to require that all commercial agents within the UAE must be UAE nationals, a UAE public joint stock company (PJSC) that is owned at least 51 percent by UAE nationals, a UAE private entity owned by a PJSC meeting the previous requirements, or a UAE private entity that is 100 percent owned by UAE nationals. In December 2022, the UAE authorized foreign entities to sell their products directly in the UAE without an agent, if there is no agent already appointed in the UAE and the principal has not previously had any agreement registered with a commercial agent in the UAE. In December 2023, the UAE issued decision No. 216, which helps to level the playing field for foreign companies by allowing those involved in a dispute with their commercial agent to seek temporary permission to circumvent their agent and ensure that foreign companies can continue to import their goods and services. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Internet Services Through its majority government-owned telecommunications service providers and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), Oman periodically slows or blocks access to certain over-the-top services. The TRA announced in September 2022 a new regulation limiting the provision of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and video internet protocol services to companies in the educational, commercial, or medical sectors. The regulation requires service providers to obtain TRA permits and house data servers and equipment in Oman, and it limits the provision of services to corporate customers (not individuals). Private sector representatives continue to request that the Omani Government provide clarifying details on the regulation and its implementation. In December 2019, the TRA announced a new regulation limiting the use of international roaming subscriber identity module (SIM) cards for Internet of Things (IoT) devices to a maximum use period of 90 days. Although the Qatari Government requires a license for telecommunications and VoIP services providers, it grants licenses only to companies intending to charter in Qatar. This requirement serves as a barrier for foreign communications service providers. Ooredoo and Vodafone Qatar are Qatar’s only VoIP and telecommunications service providers, and both are majority-owned by state-controlled entities. In March 2018, Saudi Arabia’s Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) issued the Cloud Computing Regulatory Framework. This measure granted the CITC broad powers to require cloud and other information and communications technology service providers to install and maintain governmental filtering software on their networks, restricting Internet-based services. The UAE’s nationally-controlled telecommunications service suppliers, e& and du, block access to many over-the-top Internet-based communications services, such as VoIP services, video communication services, and messaging services. UAE regulators have declined to intervene, effectively prohibiting market access for foreign suppliers of such services. In March 2020, UAE regulators announced the temporary availability of five applications to support distance learning and remote working amid the ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-196-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 189 COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, UAE regulators continued allowing these applications on a temporary basis. Stakeholders raised concern that e& and du consistently control access to, and the quality of, foreign Internet-based communications services, creating significant market access barriers for U.S.-based Internet services and apps. UAE regulators continue to insist that only national providers can provide these forms of communications services. Data Transfers In September 2021, Saudi Arabia enacted the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL). Stakeholders have noted concerns that the PDPL includes unnecessary data transfer restrictions. The Saudi Arabian Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) published an amended draft of the PDPL in December 2022, but postponed full enforcement to address feedback received during the public comment period. The SDAIA published additional draft implementing regulations in June 2023, and published the final regulations in September 2023, which have been enforced since September 2024. U.S. companies remain concerned that the PDPL did not clearly include the United States as an approved jurisdiction for data transfers; that the guidelines for compliance and harmonization of sector-specific regulations and the rules for application of “legitimate interest” in transferring data in the healthcare sector are unclear; and that Saudi Arabia did not provide a sufficient implementation period for compliance. In January 2022, the UAE’s Federal Decree No. 45 of 2021 regarding personal data protection (the Data Protection Law) came into effect. Executive regulations to clarify implementation of the Data Protection Law remain under draft. The Personal Data Protection Law restricts the cross-border flow of data unless the Emirates Data Office determines that the receiving country or territory provides adequate levels of personal data protection, the UAE is party to bilateral or multilateral agreements related to personal data protection with the receiving country, personal data is transferred under a contract that requires the recipient to adopt certain data protection measures, personal data is transferred based on consent, or another listed condition is met. Health data falls outside of the scope of the Personal Data Protection Law. UAE Federal Law No 2 of 2019 (the Health Data Law), which regulates the use of information technology and communications in the healthcare sector, came into effect in May 2019 and prevents businesses from storing, processing, generating, or transferring health data outside the UAE. UAE Health Data Ministerial Resolution 51 of 2021, which is an implementing regulation for the 2019 Health Data Law, allows health authorities in each Emirate to grant exemptions allowing for cross-border flows of health data on a case- by-case and conditional basis until full compliance is possible. The process and criteria for receiving such exemptions is not consistent across the seven Emirates. In August 2024, the Abu Dhabi - Healthcare Information and Cyber Security Standard (ADHICS) version 2.0 came into effect and allows the use of cloud data services for the storage and processing of health data inside of the UAE. ADHICS version 2.0 continues to restrict cross-border flows of health data, except when exemptions have been granted by the Department of Health – Abu Dhabi. ADHICS version 2.0 does not include a process for transferring health data across borders for legitimate purposes, such as fraud prevention or fulfilling contractual obligations with clients. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Limitations on Foreign Equity Participation Existing law generally mandates that businesses established in Kuwait be majority-owned (at least 51 percent) by Kuwaiti or other GCC nationals. However, Kuwait’s Foreign Direct Investment Law of 2013 permits the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) to authorize, on a case-by-case basis, up to 100 percent foreign ownership in the following industries: infrastructure (e.g., water, power, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-197-2048.jpg) ![190 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS wastewater treatment, and communications); insurance; information technology and software development; hospitals and pharmaceuticals; air, land, and sea freight; tourism, hotels, and entertainment; housing projects and urban development; and investment management. KDIPA has granted licenses to 69 foreign- owned firms, including U.S. companies. In December 2023, Kuwait adopted a new regulation allowing foreign companies to open branch offices in Kuwait without a local agent. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant barriers to foreign investment persist, including regulations prohibiting foreigners from investing in real estate, extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas, manufacture of coke oven products and fertilizers, and publishing; long delays associated with establishing new enterprises, which can take as long as 12 months; and difficulty identifying a local sponsor or agent, as required by law. Omani Royal Decree 29/2018 of 2019 bans foreign ownership of real estate and land in certain governorates and areas that the government deems necessary to restrict. However, non-Omanis may purchase integrated tourism complexes and residential units in multi-storied commercial and residential buildings in certain areas of the Muscat governorate under usufruct rights (i.e., the right to lease one’s property to another person), with certain restrictions. Oman has also allowed the establishment of real estate investment funds, through which foreign investors may own commercial property. In August 2024, Oman’s Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Investment Promotion issued Ministerial Resolution No. 2024/435, which amended Ministerial Resolution No. 2020/209 by adding 28 activities to the list of business activities prohibited for foreign investment, bringing the total list to 123 prohibited activities. The United States is currently seeking to confirm with the Government of Oman whether this list and the associated foreign investment prohibitions apply to U.S. investors. Qatar’s Law 1/2019 permits foreign investment in Qatar, either by partnering with a Qatari investor owning at least 51 percent of an enterprise or by obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for up to 100 percent foreign ownership. However, foreign investment in the banking and insurance sector, commercial agencies, national oil and gas companies, and companies with the right of exploration of national resources cannot exceed 49 percent foreign ownership. Council of Ministers Decision No. 2020/28 limits foreign ownership of real estate and land to nine designated zones and usufructuary rights up to 99 years in 16 other zones. Foreign investors may also own properties within selected residential complexes and retail outlets in specific commercial complexes. In August 2024, Saudi Arabia issued a new Investment Law under Royal Decree No. M/19, effective February 2025. Consistent with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and National Investment Strategy, the 2024 Investment Law applies to both foreign and domestic investors and significantly expands the business activities open to foreign investment. However, this law requires the Ministry of Investment to issue and maintain a list of “excluded activities” in which foreign investment will remain restricted unless the investor receives prior approval from MISA and the relevant government agency. Only “qualified foreign investors” (QFI) designated by Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority are permitted to buy directly the shares or convertible debt of an issuer listed on the local Tadawul stock exchange. Their investments are capped at 10 percent of any individual company. Cumulative foreign ownership cannot exceed 10 percent of the total Tadawul market capitalization or 49 percent of any individual company. Entities eligible for QFI status include banks, brokerages and securities firms, insurance companies, investment funds, and governments and government-related entities with at least $500 million in assets under management. Pursuant to amendments to the UAE Commercial Companies Law in 2020, there is no longer a federal requirement that UAE or GCC nationals own at least 51 percent of the shares of a UAE company. In 2021, Emirates began to implement legislative changes allowing up to 100 percent foreign ownership in more than 1,100 listed commercial and industrial business activities.

However, under the CAFTA–DR, as of January 1, 2015, U.S. non-agricultural goods enter Honduras duty free. In addition, nearly all U.S. agricultural exports enter Honduras duty free under the CAFTA–DR. Honduras eliminated its tariffs on rice and chicken leg quarters on January 1, 2023 and eliminated its tariffs on dairy products on January 1, 2025. For certain agricultural products, tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) permit duty-free access for specified quantities during the tariff phaseout period, with the duty-free quantities expanding during that period. Honduras will liberalize trade in white corn through continual expansion of a TRQ, rather than by the reduction of the out-of-quota tariff. Honduras is required under the CAFTA–DR to make TRQs available on January 1 of each year. Honduras monitors its TRQs through an import licensing system, which the United States carefully tracks to ensure the timely issuance of these permits. Taxes Honduran Customs imposes a 15 percent sales tax on pork rib imports when the product description is in English. However, if the product description is in Spanish, according to Decree 05-2014, the pork ribs are considered basic necessities and are exempt from sales tax. The U.S. Government has asked the Ministry of Finance to revise Decree 05-2014 to treat pork cuts labeled in English the same as those labeled in Spanish for dutiability purposes. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Licensing – Poultry, Rice, and Onions Honduras implemented a new series of complicated licensing systems for the importation of poultry products and rice in 2023 and for the importation of onions in 2024. The new system includes requirements that do not explicitly limit the importation of these products but create administrative requirements to obtain the required import licenses that have created challenges for U.S. exporters. For example, U.S. exporters are required to engage with multiple Honduran Government agencies to apply for a license. After the United States repeatedly raised these concerns, Honduras made some changes to streamline and improve ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-200-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 193 the process through modifications to Decree 104-2023 for Rice and Decree 055-2023 for Poultry, including the ability to electronically upload documents as PDF files to the Ministry of Economic Development (SDE) portal. However, importers of rice and poultry still face challenges complying with the requirements. Each administrative agency of the Government of Honduras—Honduras Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Health and Food Safety Service (SENASA), Ministry of Economic Development, and Honduran Customs—has approximately eight additional steps necessary for approval. Consistent with its international obligations, the Government of Honduras committed to notify these decrees to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Committee on Import Licensing to inform all trading partners of these new non-automatic import licensing procedures but, as of December 31, 2024, had made no such notifications. The requirements for poultry are contained in Ministerial Agreement 021-2023, published in the Official Gazette on February 16, 2023, as amended on June 17, 2023, through decree modification 055-2023. The requirements for rice are contained in Ministerial Agreement 020-2023, also published in the Official Gazette on February 16, 2023, as amended through Ministerial Agreement 104-2023, published on October 31, 2023. The new requirements for onions are contained in Ministerial Agreement 071-2024, published on May 27, 2024. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION The United States continues to have significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement in Honduras, including with respect to online and software piracy, cable signal piracy, and the distribution and sale of counterfeit and pirated goods. The United States continues to urge Honduras to fully enforce its IP laws. The United States continues to monitor Honduras’s implementation of its IP obligations under the CAFTA–DR. SERVICES BARRIERS Distribution Services U.S. firms have reported challenges working with local distributors of products from the United States. Citing the 1977 Honduran Law on Agents, Distributors and Representatives of Domestic and Foreign Companies (Decree Law No. 549), Honduras has required foreign firms to enter into agreements with local distributors to supply local markets and allowed distributors to register as the sole distributor of certain products or brands, which has at times resulted in U.S. exports being barred from import. The application of certain requirements under Decree Law No. 549 that restricted the ability of U.S. producers to distribute U.S. products in Honduras had been eliminated with the entry into force of the CAFTA–DR. However, U.S. firms continued to report in 2024 that certain restrictions on distribution were being applied to U.S. exports. LABOR The United States and Honduras continue to meet through their contact points, under Article 16.4.3 of the CAFTA–DR. This engagement includes reviewing Honduras’ progress toward implementing specific recommendations from the United States that resulted from a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) report and the United States–Honduras Labor Rights Monitoring and Action Plan. The DOL report, published in 2015 in response to a submission from the public under the CAFTA–DR raised significant concerns regarding labor law enforcement in Honduras, especially with respect to the right to freedom of association; the right to organize and bargain collectively; the minimum age for work and the worst forms of child labor; and acceptable conditions of work in various economic sectors, including apparel, automotive parts, and agriculture. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-201-2048.jpg) ![194 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS HONG KONG Hong Kong, China (Hong Kong) is a separate customs territory from mainland China, and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China states that Hong Kong can enter into international agreements in commercial, economic, and certain other matters. Hong Kong is a separate and founding Member of both the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The imposition of national security laws on Hong Kong by the Chinese Government in Beijing in 2020 and 2024 led to major structural changes in Hong Kong. These changes significantly reduced Hong Kong’s autonomy and undermined human rights and fundamental freedoms. On June 30, 2020, the Chinese Government in Beijing imposed the National Security Law (NSL) on Hong Kong. Among other provisions, Article 31 of the NSL stipulates that an incorporated or unincorporated body, which may include domestic corporations, international businesses, international non-governmental organizations, and media outlets, can be prosecuted for violating the NSL. On July 14, 2020, following imposition of the NSL, as well as other actions taken by Beijing to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy, the U.S. President issued Executive Order (EO) 13936, reflecting a presidential determination that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to justify differential treatment in relation to China under the particular laws set out in the Executive Order, and that the situation with respect to Hong Kong constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Accordingly, EO 13936 directed U.S. Government agencies to suspend or eliminate certain policy exemptions under U.S. law that had given Hong Kong differential treatment in relation to China. On March 23, 2024, the Hong Kong Government enacted the “Safeguarding National Security Ordinance” (SNSO) under Article 23 of the Basic Law. The SNSO adopted the Chinese Government’s overly broad definition of national security and would impose harsh penalties for some offenses, including up to life imprisonment. On September 6, 2024, following enactment of the SNSO, the U.S. Government released an Updated Business Advisory for Hong Kong, in which it explained how business operations in Hong Kong could be adversely impacted. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Hong Kong generally provides strong intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement and, for the most part, has strong IP laws in place. In June 2020, Hong Kong passed the Trade Marks (Amendment) Ordinance that will enable applications to be filed through the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (the Madrid Protocol) in Hong Kong. As of December 31, 2024, the ordinance had not yet been implemented. Hong Kong’s failure to modernize its copyright system has allowed it to become vulnerable to digital copyright piracy, particularly from streaming websites and illicit streaming devices (ISDs), with negative ramifications for businesses and innovators. In December 2022, Hong Kong adopted the final Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2022, which came into operation on May 1, 2023. The updated law introduced a new exclusive right for copyright owners to communicate their works to the public through any mode of electronic transmission, including streaming, and made a violation of that right subject to criminal sanctions. At the same time, the updated law did not introduce specific provisions to combat ISDs. U.S. stakeholders stated that copyright holders still face uncertainty obtaining effective civil relief against illegal ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-202-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 195 video streaming and that ISDs continue to be a concern in Hong Kong, noting the lack of criminal enforcement against the sale of ISDs and the availability of ISDs on electronic commerce platforms and in electronics stores in Hong Kong. The Customs and Excise Department of Hong Kong investigates IP crimes and routinely seizes IP- infringing products arriving from mainland China and elsewhere. However, U.S. Government officials and private sector stakeholders report that counterfeit pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and other infringing products continue to enter Hong Kong. These products are typically destined for both the Hong Kong market and markets outside of Hong Kong. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-203-2048.jpg) ![196 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS INDIA TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–India Trade Policy Forum The United States and India launched the Trade Policy Forum (TPF) in July 2005 and signed an agreement in March 2010 that formally established the TPF as the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and India. The U.S. Trade Representative and the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry (MOCI) met in New Delhi, India for the fourteenth TPF Ministerial in January 2024. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs India’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 17.0 percent in 2023 (latest data available), which was the highest of any major world economy, with an average applied tariff rate of 13.5 percent for non-agricultural goods and 39.0 percent for agricultural goods. India maintains high applied tariffs on a wide range of goods, including vegetable oils (as high as 45 percent); apples, corn, and motorcycles (50 percent); automobiles and flowers (60 percent); natural rubber (70 percent); coffee, raisins, and walnuts (100 percent); and alcoholic beverages (150 percent). In addition, India maintains very high basic customs duties (in some cases exceeding 20 percent) on drug formulations, including life-saving drugs and finished medicines listed on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines. High tariff rates also present a significant barrier to trade in other agricultural goods and processed foods (e.g., poultry, potatoes, citrus, almonds, pecans, apples, grapes, canned peaches, chocolate, cookies, frozen french fries, and other prepared foods used in fast-food restaurants). India’s World Trade Organization (WTO) bound tariff rates on agricultural products are among the highest in the world, averaging 113.1 percent and ranging as high as 300.0 percent. Given the large disparity between WTO bound and applied rates, India has considerable flexibility to change tariff rates for both agricultural and non-agricultural products at any time, creating tremendous uncertainty for U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers, and exporters. The Government of India took advantage of this tariff flexibility in the 2019/2020 budget by increasing tariffs without any notice or public consultation process on approximately 70 product categories, including those covering key U.S. exports in the agricultural, information and communication technology, medical devices, paper products, chemicals, and automotive parts sectors. In its 2020/2021 budget, India further raised tariffs for 31 product categories, including solar inverters and solar lanterns. In its 2021/2022 budget, India further raised tariff rates on imported headphones, loudspeakers, and smart meters used by power distribution companies. In addition, starting in 2014, India has repeatedly applied tariffs on certain telecommunications equipment, including network switches, that appear to be above its WTO bound commitments to provide duty-free treatment. In June 2019, following the U.S. withdrawal of India’s preferential tariff benefits under the unilateral Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program due to India’s failure to comply with the program’s eligibility criteria, India implemented retaliatory tariffs ranging from 1.7 percent to 20 percent on 28 different products imported from the United States, including almonds, apples, walnuts, chickpeas, lentils, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-204-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 197 phosphoric acid, boric acid, diagnostic regents, binders for foundry molds, select steel and aluminum products, and threaded nuts. While the decision to implement these tariffs followed the U.S. withdrawal of India’s GSP benefits, India had originally announced the intention to adopt the tariffs in June 2018 in retaliation against the U.S. decision to implement tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. § 1862). In July 2019, the United States launched a WTO dispute settlement proceeding against India challenging the retaliatory tariffs. In June 2023, in the course of discussions related to the termination of six outstanding WTO dispute settlement proceedings between the United States and India, India agreed to rescind certain retaliatory tariffs on the following U.S. origin products: chickpeas, lentils, almonds, walnuts, apples, boric acid, and diagnostic reagents. The dispute related to India’s retaliatory tariffs was terminated in July 2023. India’s Ministry of Finance published a customs notification rescinding the duties effective September 2023. The United States continues to urge India to participate in multilateral efforts to address the problem of global non-market excess capacity in the steel and aluminum sectors. Taxes Since 2018, India has applied a 10 percent surcharge on imports, which is assessed on the value of other duties rather than the customs value of the imported product. Certain products are exempted from the surcharge pursuant to official customs notifications. India routinely changes the surcharge on a range of agricultural products. Non-Tariff Barriers India maintains various forms of non-tariff barriers: banned or prohibited items that are denied entry into India (e.g., tallow, fat, and oils of animal origin); items that require a non-automatic import license (e.g., certain livestock products, pharmaceuticals, certain chemicals, certain information technology products); and items that are importable only by government trading monopolies and are subject to cabinet approval regarding import timing and quantity (e.g., corn under a tariff-rate quota). While the MOCI’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) maintains a list of all three categories of prohibited or restricted items on its website, India often fails to observe other transparency requirements, such as publication in the Gazette of India of the timing and quantity of restrictions and notification to relevant WTO committees. Import Restrictions To manage domestic oversupply, the Indian Government began imposing quantitative restrictions on imports of various pulses in 2017, based on local supply and demand conditions. In February 2022, India issued a notification to restrict the import of mung beans until March 31, 2023, but imports of most pulses are now allowed without any quantitative restrictions. However, the opaque and unpredictable nature of India’s application of quantitative restrictions has affected the ability of U.S. exporters to access the market. The United States, along with other trading partners, continues to raise India’s application of quantitative restrictions at the WTO. India applies restrictions on boric acid imports, including arbitrary import quantity approval restrictions and other requirements that only apply to imports. Long periods of time can pass without the issuance of any import licenses. In addition, the import application specifies that non-insecticidal boric acid can only be imported directly by a domestic manufacturer, which prevents independent traders from importing boric acid for resale purposes. Meanwhile, domestic producers continue to be able to sell boric acid for non- insecticidal use, subject only to a requirement to maintain records showing they are not selling to end users ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-205-2048.jpg) ![198 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS who will use the product as an insecticide. India has cited state-level court cases in Kerala and Gujarat endorsing the legal rationale for applying the restriction on boric acid imports. Import Licensing When assessing whether import licenses are required, India distinguishes between goods that are new and those that are secondhand, remanufactured, refurbished, or reconditioned. India allows imports of secondhand capital goods by end users without an import license if the goods have a residual life of at least five years. India requires import licenses for all remanufactured goods because India does not recognize that remanufactured goods have typically been restored to original working condition and meet the technical and safety specifications applied to products made from new materials. Refurbished items must be no more than seven years old and have a remaining life span of at least five years. U.S. stakeholders have reported that obtaining an import license for remanufactured goods is onerous. Stakeholders noted excessive details are required in the license application, quantity limitations are set for specific parts, and long delays occur between the submission of an application and the grant of a license. A Chartered Engineer’s Certificate is also required to import both refurbished goods and used manufactured goods. In the case of refurbished medical devices, the absence of guidelines to issue licenses and clear import processes under the Medical Device Rules has historically caused delays and uncertainty, limiting U.S. exports. U.S. companies report that they have been unable to import their devices into India since April 2024, when India’s regulator (Central Drugs Standard Control Organization or CDSCO) suspended approvals of existing and new applications for import licenses. On August 3, 2023, the Indian Government announced restrictions on imports of certain information and communications technology products, including laptops, tablets, and servers classified under Harmonized System (HS) heading 8471, which appear to include an import licensing requirement. While the licensing requirements were initially set to take effect immediately, India delayed implementation until November 2023. India later further extended the licensing requirement until December 31, 2025. U.S. exporters have expressed concerns over the lack of prior stakeholder consultations. The United States continues to monitor the situation and engage with India on these concerns. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation India’s tariff rates are announced with the annual budget and are modified on an ad hoc basis through notifications in the Gazette of India without opportunity for comment. The tariff rates are subject to numerous exemptions that vary according to the product, user, intended use, or specific export promotion program. This renders India’s customs system complex and open to administrative discretion. U.S. exporters have raised concerns regarding India’s application of customs valuation criteria to import transactions. Indian customs officials sometimes reject the declared transaction value of an import, especially if it is a product for which India maintains benchmark prices, potentially raising the cost of exports beyond what is expected given India’s applied tariff rates. U.S. companies have also faced extensive investigations related to their use of certain valuation methodologies when importing computer equipment. U.S. companies have reported being subject to extensive inspections and seizures of imports that do not appear to be risk-based. India’s customs authority generally requires extensive clearance documentation, often in electronic and paper format, which is duplicative and often leads to lengthy processing delays. U.S. exporters also raise concerns about regional variations in the application of customs procedures and in documentation requirements. These could be addressed with a robust advance ruling system in which regional discrepancies are superseded by rulings issued at a central, territory-wide level. However, U.S. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-206-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 199 exporters often report that advance rulings from one region are not respected in another region and that there is no effective central mechanism to resolve the differences. Medical Device Price Controls India’s National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) caps prices of coronary stents and knee implants. U.S. companies have raised concerns noting that the price controls have not been increased in line with inflation and do not differentiate on the basis of the cost of production or technological innovation, which dissuades U.S. companies from serving the market. Ethanol Import Restrictions Despite ambitious targets for blending ethanol with gasoline, India prohibits the importation of ethanol for fuel use. The MOCI also requires an import license from DGFT to import ethanol for non-fuel purposes. In addition, the DGFT restricts biofuel imports under HS subheadings 2207.20 and HS 2710.20, and HS heading 3826 for non-fuel use to actual users. Since May 2019, the MOCI requires an import license for importing biofuels under these HS headings and subheading. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade The United States has discussed technical barriers to trade (TBT) matters with India through the TPF as well as at, and on the margins of, meetings of the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (WTO TBT Committee). Quality Control Orders for Chemicals and Other Materials Since 2019, India has made a number of Bureau of India Standards (BIS) standards mandatory for quality control purposes in an increasing number of sectors, including chemicals, medical devices, batteries, electronics, food, and textiles. The means of verifying compliance vary. For example, India requires that chemicals have BIS marks before importation, which can only be issued following a site visit by an Indian inspector to the manufacturing facility. The United States has concerns that BIS standards are not fully aligned with international standards without demonstrating they would be ineffective or inappropriate, often do not provide a means of establishing conformity or include significantly burdensome requirements, and lack clear timelines for transition periods and license validity. The United States also has concerns that stakeholders were not consulted during the development of many of these standards. Between March 2021 and March 2024, the U.S. Government raised concerns over the polyethylene quality control order (QCO) bilaterally and at the WTO, highlighting specific concerns regarding the complexity of the labeling requirements, and offered an alternative solution to meet the requirements. The Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers implemented the QCO on January 5, 2024, and had announced on January 4, 2024 that many of the products covered by the QCOs would be exempted. For products still subject to the QCOs, U.S. industry has asked the Indian Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals to consider allowing importers to demonstrate conformity with international standards and quality specifications and to recognize self-certification as well as data from internationally accredited labs outside of India. This along with the issuance of clear guidelines and instructions to the Indian customs authority for both the QCO exemptions and QCO implementation would help to address concerns so that these burdensome requirements do not unnecessarily delay imports. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-207-2048.jpg) ![200 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Alcoholic Beverages In June 2020 and June 2023, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) published its Food Safety Standards (Alcoholic Beverages Amendment) Regulations and notified the amendments to the WTO. The FSSAI has not clarified the timeline for enforcement of its amended regulations. While FSSAI addressed several of the issues that the United States raised with India, several concerns remain, including: (1) the establishment of analytical parameters for a range of naturally occurring components in distilled spirits; (2) minimum and maximum requirements for ethyl alcohol; (3) the lack of explicit protection for Bourbon, Rye, and Tennessee Whiskey as distinctive products of the United States; (4) a lack of clarity on definitions related to single malt and single grain whiskies, brand owners, date markings, non-retail containers, multi-unit packs and spirits-based ready to drink (RTD) standards; and (5) lack of acceptance of U.S. certificate of analysis (CoA) from chemists and laboratories certified by the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Mandatory Domestic Testing and Certification Requirements for Equipment In September 2017, India’s Ministry of Communications, Department of Telecommunications published the Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, which require all telegraph equipment to undergo mandatory testing and certification. Under these rules, in 2019 India implemented the Mandatory Testing and Certification for Telecom Equipment (MTCTE) procedures, which require local security testing for telecommunication products. In May 2021, India’s Telecommunication Engineering Center proposed implementing procedures for the MTCTE program and then further expanded the scope in September 2021 to require mandatory testing for 175 products. U.S. industry remains concerned with the in-country testing and certification requirements. The United States, bilaterally through the TPF and multilaterally in the WTO TBT Committee, has urged India to reconsider its domestic testing and certification requirements, to accept test results from International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation accredited labs, and to adopt the use of the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement. The United States continues to raise concerns that U.S. electronics and information and communication technology manufacturers have expressed regarding the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) Compulsory Registration Order (CRO). The policy, which took effect in January 2014, mandates that manufacturers register their products and have them certified by laboratories accredited by the Bureau of Indian Standards, even if the products have already been certified by accredited international laboratories. In October 2021, India increased the coverage of the CRO to 63 product categories, and U.S. stakeholders report MEITY plans to continue to expand the CRO coverage. Further, under India’s Communication Security Certification Scheme (ComSec), beginning in 2023 telecommunication equipment such as routers, Wi-Fi access points, switches, and firewalls must comply with India-specific cybersecurity assurance standards (Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements or ITSAR) and undergo costly third-party testing at a designated Telecom Security Testing Laboratory (TSTL) in India. In addition to mandating testing to an outdated and country-specific standard through a limited number of approved laboratories, India requires original electronic manufacturers (OEMs) for certain equipment to disclose proprietary information such as source code or internal test results during TSTL testing. U.S. stakeholders have cited the following as continuing issues: lack of government testing capacity; a cumbersome registration process; canceled registrations due to administrative reasons that are unrelated to safety; and additional compliance costs that can exceed tens of millions of dollars, including costs associated with factory-level and component-level testing. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-208-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 201 The U.S. Government has recommended that the Indian Government recognize internationally accredited labs, harmonize labeling requirements with global practices, harmonize the validity period of test reports and certification, and eliminate retesting requirements. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers The United States has raised concerns about the science and risk basis for India’s sanitary and phytosanitary-related trade barriers to food and agricultural imports in bilateral and multilateral fora, including the TPF, the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Committee), and the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The United States will continue to make use of all available fora with a view to securing the entry of U.S. agricultural products (including dairy products, alfalfa hay, and other feed grains) into the Indian market. Agricultural Biotechnology Products derived from modern biotechnology must be approved by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) before importation or domestic cultivation. The Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006 includes specific provisions for regulating food products derived from genetically engineered (GE) products; however, as of December 31, 2024, FSSAI was still in the process of establishing its regulations. India’s biotechnology approval processes are slow, opaque, and subject to political influences and do not appear to take into account science-based approval processes for GE products in exporting countries. GEAC’s uncertain approval process continues to hamper GE product registrations needed to facilitate trade in food and feed products. Non-Genetically Modified and Genetically Modified-Free Certificates In March 2021, the FSSAI implemented an order requiring a non-Genetically Modified (non-GM) origin and “Genetically Modified free” (GM-free) certificate for 24 listed products. Each consignment of these products entering India must be accompanied by (1) a non-GM origin and GM-free attestation on the phytosanitary or health certificate that contains the information specified in FSSAI’s order of August 21, 2020, or (2) a non-GM origin and GM-free certificate issued by a regional (i.e., state level) government authority of the exporting country. The 24 products include grains, oilseeds, fruits, and vegetable products, regardless of whether GE varieties of those crops are in commercial production or are being exported to India. India has not provided any scientific or risk-based justification for the requirement. The United States and several other countries have pressed India to rescind the requirement in comments submitted to the WTO TBT and SPS Committees, and continue to engage the Indian Government, including the FSSAI, on the order. Certificate Requirements In September 2022, the FSSAI issued a clarification notice to its earlier notification F. No. 1829/Health Certificate/FSSAI/Imports (2021). The notice states that the FSSAI will require a new health certificate for the import of milk and milk products, pork and pork products, and fish and fish products. The certificate contains a number of duplicate attestations already required by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD), but also requires new attestations that are not relevant to food safety or based on science. In 2023, FSSAI and DAHD agreed to combine their certificates into a single document, but the new attestations remain. After several postponements, enforcement of the new certificate requirement for dairy products began in late 2024. India has indicated that it will continue to add additional commodities to the list of products that require the new certificate. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-209-2048.jpg) ![202 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Foreign Facilities Registration for Agricultural Products As of February 2023, FSSAI requires the competent authorities of exporting countries to provide a list of exporters of milk and milk products; meat and meat products, including poultry and fish; egg powder; infant food; and nutraceuticals to India in the mandated FSSAI format. Dairy Products India imposes onerous requirements on dairy imports. India requires that dairy products intended for food be derived from animals that have not consumed feeds containing internal organs, blood meal, or tissues of ruminant or porcine origin and that exporting countries certify to these conditions, which lack a discernable animal health or human health justification. This requirement, along with the recent dairy health certificate requirements, new facility registration requirements, and high tariff rates, continues to hamper market access for U.S. milk and dairy product exports to India, one of the largest dairy markets in the world. The U.S. Government continues to press the Indian Government, including through the TPF, to provide greater access to the Indian dairy market. Distiller’s Dried Grains with Solubles India’s regulatory requirements on distiller’s dried grains with solubles (DDGS) remain unclear. Since 2015, the GEAC has received at least 11 applications from Indian importers to import U.S. DDGS. Local feed companies, along with the U.S. Government, continue to advocate that DDGS be exempted from further regulatory requirements, noting that DDGS are a processed product and pose no risk to the environment. In July 2018, the GEAC formed the Sub-Committee on Guidelines for Imports of Animal Feed to establish procedures for applications related to the imports of animal feeds, including DDGS. The Sub-Committee submitted recommendations for approval to the GEAC in November 2019. As of the January 2024 TPF Ministerial meeting, the GEAC has not officially confirmed that it will not regulate DDGS as living modified organisms. In addition, unclear jurisdiction for the approval process for animal feed continues to complicate the process. For example, in December 2019, the FSSAI published Direction 1-95, announcing new requirements for commercial animal feeds and feed materials that are manufactured, imported, or distributed in India. Prior to the publication of Direction 1-95, however, the FSSAI had not regulated the manufacture, import, or distribution of either commercial animal feeds or feed ingredients in India. India indicated it would issue an administrative order to clarify the formal regulatory authority of animal feed in 2024; however, as of December 31, 2024, the orders were yet to be issued. Alfalfa Hay The United States continues to pursue market access for alfalfa hay. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and India’s Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare held several rounds of technical discussions to address India’s import requirements. In 2021, India and the United States agreed to a framework for bilateral market access for several agricultural products, including conventional and GE alfalfa hay from the United States. In August 2022, the GEAC issued a “no objection” to imports of GE alfalfa hay from the United States, and referred the matter to the FSSAI. In October 2022, India’s FSSAI raised concerns regarding the approval of GE animal feed imports, including alfalfa hay, impeding additional progress on this issue. The United States raised the issue at the TPF Ministerial meeting in January 2024, and India indicated its intention to address import approvals of alfalfa hay and other feeds, however this remains pending. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-210-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 203 Poultry In 2012, the United States commenced WTO dispute settlement proceedings against India’s import prohibitions on various agricultural products from the United States, including poultry and poultry products, ostensibly due to concerns regarding avian influenza. The WTO panel and Appellate Body issued reports in favor of the United States. In 2016, the United States requested authorization from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) to suspend concessions or other obligations on the grounds that India had failed to comply with the DSB recommendations within the “reasonable period of time” to which the parties agreed. The U.S. request was referred to arbitration. In April 2017, India requested the establishment of a compliance panel, asserting that it had enacted a revised avian influenza measure that complied with its WTO obligations. In September 2023, the United States and India announced an agreement to settle this dispute. As part of the agreement, India agreed to reduce tariffs on certain U.S. products, including frozen turkey, premium frozen duck, fresh blueberries and cranberries, frozen blueberries and cranberries, dried blueberries and cranberries, and processed blueberries and cranberries. On March 15, 2024, the parties notified a mutually agreed solution to the WTO. The United States is working with U.S. exporters to ensure that they take full advance of these tariff reductions. Plant Health Issues India maintains zero-tolerance standards for certain plant pests, such as weed seeds and ergot, that do not appear to be based on risk assessments and that constrain U.S. grain and pulse exports. Bilateral discussions to resolve these issues, including at the senior official level, have achieved little success. India requires methyl bromide (MB) fumigation at the port of origin as a condition for the importation of pulses. This type of fumigation cannot be performed below 5°C/40°F, limiting its use at many U.S. facilities, so the United States requested that India permit entry of U.S. peas and pulses subject to inspection and fumigation at the port of arrival, to which India acquiesced. India has granted a series of extensions allowing MB fumigation on arrival but has offered no permanent solution. In April 2018, the Indian Government confirmed the extension of the fumigation-upon-arrival waiver for U.S. peas and pulses, including chickpeas, indefinitely until both parties come to an understanding on the U.S. systems-based approach. The U.S. walnut industry requested a change to India’s fumigation protocol to allow sulfuryl fluoride and phosphine in place of MB. However, the United States is still awaiting official approval of such change through notification in the Indian Gazette. Similarly, the United States is seeking approval for an alternative treatment to MB fumigation for U.S.-origin in-shell pecans, recommending either a cold treatment or a hot water bath treatment for in-shell pecans. The United States is awaiting a response from the Indian Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare’s Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine and Storage as well as approval through notification in the Indian Gazette. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT India lacks an overarching government procurement policy and, as a result, its government procurement practices and procedures vary among different ministries within the central government. India provides procurement preferences to Indian micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises and to state-owned enterprises. In all defense procurements, India’s offset program requires companies to invest 30 percent or more of the acquisition cost of contracts above the threshold value in Indian-produced parts, equipment, or services, which continues to be challenging for U.S. manufacturers, including those of high-technology equipment, to meet given changing rules and limited opportunities. In June 2020, the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade issued the Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order 2020, a revision to the 2017 procurement order mandating preferences ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-211-2048.jpg) ![204 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS for domestically manufactured goods, including defense procurement. The rule was updated again in September 2020, instructing each ministry or department to draft a follow-on order that favors domestic suppliers, and permits mandated percentages to be applied to benefit Indian suppliers. The August 2020 changes to General Financial Rules section 161 state that foreign tender enquiries may not be accepted under $31 million and further reductions of the minimum requirements related to domestic production cannot be implemented without permission of an appropriate authority. Furthermore, companies must use a third-party or internal auditor to certify the amount of domestic production that will be used if the value is equal to or greater than 10 crore or 100 million rupees (approximately $1.19 million). In September 2020, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy released an order reserving a list of 80 products, including solar cells, modules, wind turbines, and electrical equipment for hydro and biogas, for bidding only by suppliers with 50 percent or more domestic content, irrespective of the purchase value. The Ministry of Power also reserved 78 products for domestic procurement through a similar order published in June 2021. In April 2020, MEITY issued a notification that entities must procure cellular mobile phones only from domestic suppliers meeting the domestic production requirement of 50 percent, irrespective of purchase value. A September 2020 MEITY notification specified the mechanism for calculation of domestic production for: (1) desktop PCs; (2) thin clients; (3) computer monitors; (4) laptop PCs; (5) tablets; (6) dot matrix printers; (7) contact and contactless smart cards; (8) LED products; (9) biometric access control/authentication devices; (10) biometric fingerprint sensors; (11) biometric iris sensors; (12) servers; and (13) cellular mobile phones. India is not a party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since February 2010. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION India remained on the Priority Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report due to inconsistent progress on long-standing intellectual property (IP) concerns raised in prior Special 301 Reports. The 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List) includes physical and online marketplaces located in or connected to India. The United States and India continue to engage on a range of IP challenges facing U.S. companies in India with the intention of creating stronger IP protection and enforcement in India. In the field of copyright, policy uncertainty and ineffective enforcement remain concerns. Copyright holders continue to report high levels of piracy, particularly online. Court cases and government memoranda raise concerns that a broad range of published works will not be afforded meaningful copyright protection. In a positive development, in August 2024, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under Ministry of Commerce and Industry, withdrew its September 2016 office memorandum that extended the scope of statutory licensing under Section 31D of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 to Internet transmissions. However, concerns remain regarding the possible amending of Section 31D to require statutory licensing for interactive transmissions, as recommended by the Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce in July 2021, which would have severe implications for copyright holders who make their content available online. The breadth of some licenses available under Chapter VI of the Indian Copyright Act and overly broad exceptions for certain uses have raised concerns regarding the strength of copyright protection in India. Amendments to the Indian Copyright Act needed to bring India’s domestic legislation into alignment with international best practices are absent.

Furthermore, stakeholders have reported continuing problems with unauthorized file sharing of video games, signal theft by cable operators, commercial-scale photocopying and unauthorized reprints of academic books, and circumvention of technological protection measures. While the High Courts at Delhi, Madras, Calcutta, and Himachal Pradesh have established their own dedicated IP Divisions to handle IPR matters, the need for such dedicated IP divisions in other High Courts and additional staffing and sensitization continues. In the field of patents, several factors negatively affect stakeholders’ perception of India’s overall IP regime, investment climate, and innovation goals. As of December 31, 2024, patent applicants reported that they continue to face long waiting periods to receive patent grants, and excessive reporting requirements. While Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024 include provisions that are likely to increase the efficiency of the patent regime and reduce current burdens on the patent applicants, concerns remain with respect to the currently amended “Statement of Working of Patents” (Form 27). Among other concerns, the potential threat of patent revocations and the procedural and discretionary invocation of patentability criteria under the Indian Patents Act impact companies across different sectors. In the pharmaceutical sector, the United States continues to monitor the restriction on patent-eligible subject matter in Section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act and its impacts. Pharmaceutical stakeholders continue to raise concerns as to whether India has an effective system for protecting against unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products. U.S. stakeholders also express concerns as to whether India has an effective mechanism for the early resolution of potential pharmaceutical patent disputes. India’s overall IP enforcement remains inadequate. U.S. brand owners continue to report excessive delays in trademark opposition proceedings and a lack of quality in examination. Finally, U.S. and Indian companies have identified trade secret protection as a growing concern and expressed interest in India eliminating gaps in its trade secrets regime, such as through the adoption of comprehensive trade secret legislation. Little has been done towards the adoption of a standalone trade secret law, despite being highlighted in India’s 2016 National IPR Policy, and recommended by the Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce and Law Commission of India in July 2021 and March 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, no civil or criminal laws in India specifically address the protection of trade secrets. SERVICES BARRIERS Foreign investment in businesses in certain major services sectors, including financial services and retail, is subject to limitations on foreign equity, and foreign participation in professional services is significantly restricted. In addition, barriers to digital trade and electronic commerce, such as those imposed on electronic payment providers, have secondary effects on a wide variety of services. Audiovisual Services The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority’s regulations on content aggregation and distribution do not allow bundling of channels or certain types of distribution partnerships. Content aggregation is commonly used internationally, as it allows niche and foreign content to be bundled and sold by domestic partners without a large local presence or sales force. These regulations cause difficulties for small and international content providers because these companies must interact with each of the 60,000 local cable operators, radio broadcasters, and television broadcasters they seek to target. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-213-2048.jpg) ![206 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS There are also some limits on foreign ownership in the audiovisual and media sectors, namely FM radio (49 percent), newspapers (26 percent), and digital media firms that upload and stream news and current affairs (26 percent). Distribution Services India imposes certain restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail industry. With respect to single-brand retail, foreign investments exceeding 51 percent are contingent on, among other things, a requirement to source at least 30 percent of the value of products sold from Indian sources. India has modified the requirements in recent years, including by allowing firms to offset the sourcing requirement by sourcing products from India for global supply chains. India caps foreign ownership in the multi-brand retail sector at 51 percent and leaves to each Indian state the final decision on whether to authorize such FDI in its territory. In addition, where FDI is allowed, it is subject to conditions, including: (1) a minimum investment of approximately $100 million, at least 50 percent of which must be in “back-end infrastructure” (e.g., processing, distribution, quality control, packaging, logistics, storage, and warehousing); (2) a requirement to operate only in cities that have been identified by the relevant state government; and (3) a requirement to source at least 30 percent of the value of products sold from a subset of Indian enterprises. These conditions on foreign investment diminish the commercial incentive for multi-brand retailers seeking to invest in India’s retail sector. India prohibits foreign investment in business-to-consumer (or “inventory-based”) electronic commerce. In February 2019, India implemented regulations that expressly prohibit subsidiaries of foreign-owned marketplace-based electronic commerce sites from selling products on their parent companies’ sites. The only exceptions for FDI in inventory-based electronic commerce are for food-product retailing and single- brand retailers that meet certain conditions, including the operation of physical stores in India. Financial Services Banking Services Although India allows privately held banks to operate in the country, the banking system is dominated by state-owned banks, which account for approximately 60 percent of total market share and 67 percent of all Indian bank branches. Most privately owned banks are Indian owned, with foreign banks constituting less than 0.6 percent of the total bank branches in India. Under India’s branch authorization policy, foreign banks are required to submit their internal branch expansion plans on an annual basis, and their ability to expand is hindered by non-transparent limitations established by the Indian Government on branch office expansion. India caps foreign ownership of private banks at 74 percent and public banks at 20 percent. Foreign ownership of infrastructure companies in the securities markets (such as stock exchanges, commodity exchanges, depositories, and clearing corporations) is limited to 49 percent. Insurance Services India maintains an unlevel playing field in the insurance market. State-owned companies are not subject to the same law and prudential supervision as private firms and enjoy various guarantees from the government. Currently, the Indian Government maintains an explicit sovereign guarantee on every life insurance corporation (LIC) policy. As a result, many customers choose to buy LIC policies over those offered by private insurers, giving LIC an unfair competitive advantage. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-214-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 207 In March 2021, India passed the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which removed restrictions on foreign ownership and control of Indian insurance companies and increased the maximum foreign investment allowed from 49 percent to 74 percent. According to India’s 2025 Union Budget, India will raise its FDI cap on the insurance sector from 74 percent to 100 percent. While this represents progress, it still is not clear if India will remove safeguards instituted in 2021. These safeguards require a majority of board members to be Indian residents and, if an insurer is incorporated or domiciled outside of India, to maintain a higher solvency requirement for foreign-invested insurers. These requirements also apply to any insurer incorporated in India that has at least 33 percent of its capital owned by investors domiciled outside India or 33 percent of the members of the governing body domiciled outside India. In 2015, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) issued a revision to its regulations governing the provision of reinsurance services in India. The regulations afforded Indian reinsurers a mandatory first order of preference (or right of first refusal) for reinsurance business in India. In 2017, the Reinsurance Experts Committee unanimously recommended that IRDAI implement a waiver process for life insurance products, which it did in 2019. Non-life reinsurance remains subject to a two- step procedure where foreign firms can offer terms to cedents, but every cedent must then first offer the best terms obtained to Indian reinsurers. This results in unequal treatment for foreign reinsurers and consolidates risk in a small number of Indian reinsurers, which is counter to global best practices of global diversification of risk. Electronic Payment Services The United States has continued to raise concerns relating to informal and formal policies with respect to electronic payments services that appear to favor Indian domestic suppliers over foreign suppliers. In November 2020, the state-owned National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) announced a market share limitation of 30 percent (measured by transactions) for foreign electronic payment service suppliers processing online payments made through India’s Unified Payment Interface, which is owned and operated by NPCI. Foreign digital payment companies were given until January 2023 to ensure their market shares met the 30 percent limit, but the Ministry of Finance has not enforced this market share ceiling. The United States also has expressed concern over plans to expand the adoption of a National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) that only uses a domestic proprietary QR code standard, which disadvantages foreign suppliers. India has not yet shared the domestic qSPARC standard, effectively prohibiting firms from participating in the roll-out of the NCMC. Professional Services Legal Services Membership in the Bar Council of India (BCI), the governing body for the legal profession, is mandatory to practice law in India and is limited to Indian citizens. In 2023, the BCI notified “Rules for Registration and Regulation of Foreign Lawyers and Foreign Law Firms in India, 2022” in the Gazette of India, creating the first step toward allowing foreign law firms to open offices in India for the practice of international and foreign-country law. However, U.S. industry has reported that the BCI has not yet released the forms necessary for foreign law firms to apply for registration under the new rules. Stakeholders have also commented that the rules are limited in scope and ambiguous—including a clarification issued by the BCI shortly after the notification that appears to restrict international law firms to advising non-Indian clients only—which would limit the impact of the new rules on foreign firms’ ability to operate in India. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-215-2048.jpg) ![208 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Accounting Services Foreign accounting firms face obstacles to entering the Indian accounting services sector. Only accounting firms structured as partnerships under Indian law may supply financial auditing services, and only Indian- licensed accountants may be equity partners in an Indian accounting firm. Telecommunications Services Satellite Services India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting maintains a preference for Indian satellites to provide capacity for direct-to-home (DTH) subscription television services. In practice, DTH licensees have not been permitted to contract directly with foreign satellite operators and have encountered procedural delays when they have sought to do so. Rather, DTH licensees must procure satellite capacity through Antrix, the commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which in turn only permits foreign procurements if it does not have available capacity on Indian satellites. When ISRO does permit the use of foreign satellite capacity, the foreign satellite operator must sell the capacity to ISRO, which in turn resells the capacity to the end-user with a surcharge. The United States continues to encourage India to adopt an “open skies” satellite policy to allow consumers the flexibility to select the satellite capacity provider that best suits their business requirements and to promote market access for foreign satellite service providers. Roaming In March 2024, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued a recommendation to India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) that it mandate all machine-to-machine (M2M) devices utilizing embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) cards with international roaming arrangements be switched to domestic mobile network operators within six months, which may impose additional costs on manufacturers and users of M2M devices by requiring removal or replacement of eSIM cards or rendering affected devices inoperable if their eSIM cards are unable to be removed. Such a mandate would not align with the general international practice to permit companies to enter into global roaming contracts for their devices and would prevent U.S. telecommunications operators from providing such services in India. The United States urged DoT to reconsider the TRAI recommendation and continued to engage with India on this issue. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Electronic Payment Services In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) implemented a requirement that all payment service suppliers store all information related to electronic payments by Indian citizens on servers located in India. RBI announced this rule without advance notice or input from stakeholders. In 2019, RBI stated the requirement to store payments data locally also applied to banks operating in India. Foreign firms assert that the data storage requirement hampers the ability of service suppliers to detect fraud and ensure the security of their global networks. Internet Services In February 2021, the Indian Government published regulations, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Rules), to govern a wide range of Internet- based service providers, particularly those that operate social media, messaging, and news and ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-216-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 209 entertainment content in India. The IT Rules require compliance by “significant” social media intermediaries and platforms with five million registered users or more. The IT Rules impose a number of requirements that U.S. stakeholders have identified as concerning. For example, the IT Rules impose personal criminal liability on individual employees in cases where a firm is not in compliance with the rules. The IT Rules also include imposition of impractical compliance deadlines and take-down protocols. Since 2021, U.S. firms have been subject to an increasing number of takedown requests for content and user accounts related to issues that appear politically motivated. Shutdowns and Other Threats to the Open Internet India has conducted a number of localized shutdowns of the Internet in recent years. These shutdowns restrict access to information and services, disrupting commercial operations, and thereby undermining a free and open Internet and impeding trade in the digital economy. The United States continues to monitor the impact of these events on U.S. trade and investment, including services exports. Digital Services Taxation Effective 2016, India began assessing a six percent “equalization levy,” a withholding tax on gross revenue received by non-Indian residents for online advertisements and related services provided to Indian purchasers, with the ostensible goal of equalizing the playing field between resident service suppliers and non-resident service suppliers. In 2020, the scope of the equalization levy was expanded to introduce a two percent tax on gross revenue received by non-Indian suppliers of “e-commerce supplies or services”— covering a wide range of digital services, including cloud services and online gaming services—to Indian customers. The two percent tax explicitly excluded all Indian companies. The United States and India are among the 137 member jurisdictions to have joined the October 8, 2021, OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalization of the Economy, which called for all Parties to commit to not introduce digital services taxes (DSTs) in the future. On November 24, 2021, under the prior administration, the United States joined India in a joint statement on a transitional approach to India’s DST during the transitional period prior to implementation of Pillar 1. According to the statement, DST liability that accrued to India during the transitional period would be creditable in defined circumstances against future corporate income tax liability due under Pillar 1. In return, the Section 301 trade action initiated with respect to goods of India was not continued. The arrangement set out in the joint statement was extended to June 30, 2024. In the Finance (No. 2) Bill of 2024, India removed the two percent tax as of August 1, 2024. India’s six percent “equalization levy” remains in place; however, as of March 2025, India has initiated a process to remove it as well. On January 20, 2025, the United States issued a White House Memorandum titled, “The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal (Global Tax Deal).” The memorandum stated: The Secretary of the Treasury and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the OECD shall notify the OECD that any commitments made by the prior administration on behalf of the United States with respect to the Global Tax Deal have no force or effect within the United States absent an act by the Congress adopting the relevant provisions of the Global Tax Deal. On January 22, 2025, appropriate representatives of the Treasury Department provided notice to the Director of the Centre of Tax Policy and Administration at the OECD. On January 24, 2025, the U.S. Permanent Delegation to the OECD provided similar notice to the Secretary General of the OECD. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-217-2048.jpg) ![210 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Data Localization In August 2023, the Prime Minister signed the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), establishing a data privacy regime in India. In February 2025, India released draft implementing rules for the DPDPA, which impose potentially burdensome requirements on data fiduciaries, and require disclosures of personal data to the Indian Government. The draft rules also permit the Central Government to restrict cross-border data transfers to a specific country if the Government of India provides appropriate notification of such restrictions. The DPDPA may also allow for sectoral regulations or laws, such as sectoral data localization requirements if they are found to provide a greater degree of data protection. SUBSIDIES Agriculture Subsidies India provides a broad range of subsidies and support to its agricultural sector, including credit subsidies, debt waivers, crop insurance, and subsidies for inputs (such as fertilizer, fuel, electricity, and seeds) at both the central government and state government levels. These subsidies, which are of substantial cost to the government, lower the cost of production for India’s producers and have the potential to distort the market in which imported products compete. In addition, producers of 25 agricultural products benefit from the government’s Minimum Support Price (MSP) program, which utilizes one of the most production- and trade-distorting types of support, market-price support. Rice and wheat account for the largest share of products procured under the MSP program and are stockpiled and distributed through India’s public stockpiling system. India’s announcement of MSPs can have the effect of providing a subsidy to the entire crop by setting a price floor for India’s farmers. The prices are announced before the planting season. Therefore, the MSP bolsters planting decisions, resulting in overproduction, limited demand for imports, and artificial export competitiveness. In addition, in certain years and for specific products, states have provided additional incentives in the form of “bonuses” above the MSPs announced by the Government of India. From 2018 to present, several WTO Members have submitted seven counter notifications against India’s MSP program, covering several of the 25 agricultural products benefiting from it, with a particular focus on sugar, rice, and wheat. India’s public food stockholding program is a large and complex series of programs designed to carry out multiple objectives. India’s public stockholding programs are controversial because the government procures food grains and other commodities at guaranteed supported prices through MSP programs rather than at market prices. In the case of rice, in particular, India’s excessive subsidization through market-price support has gone far beyond its domestic food security needs and has helped India secure its place as the top global exporter of rice, accounting for more than 40 percent of global rice exports in recent years. India has notified the WTO that it is exceeding its WTO agricultural subsidy limits for rice for the last four years, but it claims the breach is covered under the 2013 interim WTO Ministerial Decision on Public Stockholding for Food Security Purposes. India is leading efforts at the WTO for an expanded permanent solution on public stockholding, which would allow all WTO developing country Members to use unlimited market-price support for purchases of any products associated with a public stockholding program. While WTO Members can procure unlimited quantities of food for public stockholding at market prices and the number of WTO Members utilizing market-price support for procurement is limited, India and others have framed the issue as a food security issue. In addition, in the past, India has used export subsidies to reduce government-held stocks and has permitted exports of certain agricultural commodities (e.g., wheat) from government public-stockholding reserves at below the government’s costs. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-218-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 211 OTHER BARRIERS Transparency A lack of transparency continues to affect new and proposed laws and regulations, as well as a lack of uniform notice and comment procedures and inconsistent notification of these measures to the WTO.

The TIFA is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Indonesia. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs Indonesia’s average Most-Favored Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 8 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Indonesia’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 8.6 percent for agricultural products and 7.9 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Indonesia has bound 96.3 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 37.1 percent. Over the last decade, Indonesia has progressively increased its applied tariff rates on a variety of goods, particularly those competing with locally manufactured products. These include electronic products, milling machines, chemicals, cosmetics, medicines, wine and spirits, iron wire and wire nails, and a range of agricultural products. While most tariffs on non-agricultural goods are bound at 35.5 percent, certain sectors such as automobiles, iron, steel, and select chemical products have tariffs that exceed 35.5 percent or remain unbound. In the agricultural sector, 99 percent of the products are bound above 25 percent, reflecting Indonesia’s protectionist approach in these areas. In a significant regulatory shift on January 1, 2020, Indonesia issued Minister of Finance (MOF) Regulation No. 199/2019, which lowered the price threshold for import duty exemptions on imported consumer goods (known as consignment goods) from $75 to $3. Certain types of books, bags, garments, and footwear are exempted from the regulation. Further regulatory changes occurred with the enactment of MOF Regulation No. 96/2023, effective on October 17, 2023, which replaced MOF Regulation No. 199/2019. MOF Regulation 96/2023 retained the lower price threshold for import duty exemptions on imported consumer goods and imposed new tariff rates on cosmetics, bicycles, watches, and other iron and steel goods. The new rates followed related regulations issued earlier in 2023. Currently, the types of products subject to Indonesia’s new tariff rates are bags (15 percent to 20 percent), textile products (5 percent to 25 percent), footwear/shoes (5 percent to 30 percent), cosmetics (10 percent to 15 percent), iron and steel goods (zero percent to 20 percent), bicycles (25 percent to 40 percent), and watches (10 percent). U.S. stakeholders raised concerns in 2024 regarding Indonesia’s application of tariffs in excess of its WTO bound rates for certain categories of information and communication technology products. For example, despite having a WTO bound rate of zero percent for subheadings under Harmonized System (HS) code heading 8517, which include switching and routing equipment, Indonesia appears to be applying a 10 percent duty for these products. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-220-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 213 MOF Regulation No. 9/2024 exempted Completely Built Up (CBU) and Completely Knocked Down (CKD) battery electric vehicles from the luxury goods sales tax. MOF Regulation No. 10/2024 exempted CBU and CKD electric vehicles from import duties if the EV maker builds or invests in a four-wheeled electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Indonesia. Taxes U.S. stakeholders continue to express concerns about the MOF’s Directorate General of Taxes’ tax assessment process. Such concerns include: a non-transparent and cumbersome auditing process; heavy fines for administrative mistakes; lengthy dispute mechanisms; and a lack of legal precedent within the Tax Court. Indonesia’s current excise tax regime imposes higher excise tax rates on imported spirits than on domestic spirits. For beverages with an alcohol content between 5 percent and 20 percent, the excise tax rate is 24 percent higher for imported products compared to domestic products. For beverages with higher alcohol content (between 20 percent and 55 percent), the excise tax is 52 percent higher for imported products compared to domestic products. MOF Regulation No. 110/2018 increased withholding tax rates for 1,147 imported products, including consumer and luxury goods. The stated objective for this policy is to decrease Indonesia’s current account deficit by reducing imports of these goods. MOF Regulation No. 41/2022, effective April 1, 2022, revised MOF Regulation No. 110/2018 and increased the number of imported items that are subject to prepayment of income tax at the time of import under Income Tax Article 22. The regulation adds HS codes for 716 categories of imported goods subject to income tax at a rate of 10 percent of the transaction value. The regulation lists 1,188 HS codes subject to income tax at a rate of 7.5 percent and seven HS codes with an income tax at a rate of 0.5 percent. Stakeholders have raised concerns that the process of claiming a return of excess pre-paid income tax at the time of import can take multiple years and considerable effort. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Licensing Indonesia’s import licensing system continues to be a significant non-tariff barrier for U.S. businesses due to numerous, overlapping import licensing requirements that impede market access. The Ministry of Trade requires all importers to obtain an import license as either an importer of certain goods for further distribution (API-U) or as an importer for their own manufacturing (API-P); importers are not permitted to obtain both types of licenses. An API-P import license allows companies to import finished products for market testing, after sales service purposes, or to “complete a product line,” but only if the goods are new, consistent with the company’s business license, and meet stringent import requirements. Under Government Regulation (GR) No. 29/2021, importers must obtain a business identification number (NIB) through Indonesia’s Online Single Submission (OSS) processing system. The NIB serves as a valid import license and can serve in place of an API-U or API-P. Companies report that the OSS adds complexity and causes delays due to frequent technical issues and a lack of system integration (i.e., national and local-level requirements are not fully synchronized within OSS). Although all interested parties should be able to apply for an advance ruling to ensure the treatment of imports upon arrival, in effect, Indonesia limits applications to only those with a NIB and API license. Presidential Regulation No. 61/2024 (which replaced Presidential Regulation No. 32/2022) provides for a commodity balance policy, which makes the issuance of import licenses subject to an Indonesian Government assessment of supply and demand for a commodity. The policy was initially implemented for 2022 import licenses for five commodities (sugar, rice, fish, meat, and salt) at the end of 2021. The policy ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-221-2048.jpg) ![214 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS was expanded in 2023 to cover 19 additional products, including some non-agricultural products. In early 2025, the policy was expanded to include garlic, and the government intends to include apples, grapes, and oranges in 2026. Stakeholders have expressed concern regarding the Indonesian Government’s lack of stakeholder consultation on this policy, expansion to new products with little notice, and inconsistent implementation, which has led to frequent delays in obtaining import licenses. Challenges are particularly great at the start of each calendar year, when companies are required to adapt quickly to new or revised regulations issued with little or no warning. Minister of Trade (MOT) Regulation No. 20/2021 and its amendment MOT Regulation No. 25/2022—which aim to synthesize all import-related regulations and serve as an “umbrella” regulation for the management of Indonesia’s import policies—also require that import licenses for certain commodities be issued based on the commodity balance policy. Indonesia has not provided a comprehensive list of products that will be subject to this policy in the future. The United States remains concerned about the lack of transparency, import quantity restrictions that do not reflect market demand, and the repeated delays in importers receiving licenses, especially at the start of each calendar year. MOT Regulation 36/2023, effective March 10, 2024, established requirements to obtain import approval for nearly 4,000 HS codes. To obtain the approval, importers must disclose substantial amounts of commercial data and, for certain products, obtain an additional “Technical Approval” from the government. Stakeholders broadly criticized MOT Regulation 36/2023 and its new requirements as onerous and unclear, and unresolved by subsequent amendments MOT Regulations 3/2024 and 7/2024. Stakeholders pointed to MOT Regulation 36/2023 as causing a backlog of containers at major ports in Indonesia in early May 2024. In response, Indonesia issued MOT Regulation 8/2024 on May 17, 2024, which removed the “Technical Approval” requirements and relaxed import licensing for most products. MOT Regulation 36/2023, however, remains in place for iron and steel products, tire, and other upstream chemicals, as well as some textile-based products (e.g., medical masks). Agricultural Products Indonesia maintains complex and burdensome licensing regimes for the importation of horticultural products, animals, and animal products. In 2013, the United States challenged Indonesia’s restrictions under the WTO’s dispute settlement procedures because Indonesia repeatedly failed to address U.S. Government concerns. On December 22, 2016, the WTO issued the panel report, finding for the United States and co-complainant New Zealand on all 18 claims and finding that Indonesia was applying import restrictions and prohibitions that were inconsistent with WTO rules. The WTO Appellate Body subsequently upheld the panel’s findings. Since the Appellate Body report, Indonesia has amended its import licensing requirements several times. Through the issuance of Minister of Agriculture (MOA) Regulation No. 2/2020, imports of horticultural products from countries with a food safety system recognized by the MOA, such as the United States, are exempt from the requirement to provide certain quality and safety certificates. This regulation also extends the validity of horticultural product import licenses for 60 days into the following calendar year. However, MOA Regulation No. 5/2022 affirms the requirement for 29 imported horticultural products to have an import recommendation (RIPH). MOT Regulation No. 8/2024 does not include the RIPH requirement and provides that import licenses will instead be issued on the basis of available supply and demand data, if the commodity balance for a particular product has not yet been determined. In practice, this could limit import licenses based on other regulatory requirements, including requirements for a letter stating the availability of adequate cold storage facilities for horticultural products, proof of control of refrigerated warehouses (cold storage), and a distribution plan or production plan. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-222-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 215 Quantitative Restrictions In addition to covering some agricultural products, including sugar, under the commodity balance policy, as noted above, Indonesia exercises stringent control over the importation of these commodities through annual quantitative import limits based on domestic production and consumption forecasts. These import restrictions are designed to protect local industries but have significant implications for market access for U.S. and other foreign exporters. For example, sugar refineries are only allowed to import raw sugar to produce refined sugar for the food and beverage industry, but only up to a Government of Indonesia (GOI)-predetermined annual allocation, and sugar mills are only authorized to import raw sugar to offset idle milling capacity. While some food and beverage companies are permitted to import limited volumes of sugar directly, these imports are subject to strict conditions, including a requirement to prioritize the use of refined domestic sugar before resorting to imports. This policy effectively limits flexibility for companies, constraining their ability to source sugar competitively on the global market. Pharmaceutical Market Access The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has raised concerns regarding the opportunity for meaningful stakeholder engagement in Indonesia’s pharmaceutical procurement system. Stakeholders specifically report a lack of transparency with regards to how pharmaceutical products are selected for listing on Indonesia’s online public procurement catalog and whether there are clear criteria governing how long such products remain listed. MOH Regulation No. 1010/2008 requires a foreign pharmaceutical company either to manufacture locally or to entrust another company that is already registered as a manufacturer in Indonesia to obtain drug approvals and import permits on its behalf. Presidential Regulation No. 10/2021 limits traditional medicine companies to domestic ownership only, effectively excluding foreign companies from this market segment. In January 2023, the Indonesian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 6/2023, which requires that all medicines, biological products, and medical devices sold in Indonesia, along with their manufacturing methods (including associated materials, manufacturing processes, storage, and packaging) be halal certified. The regulation requires Class D medical devices to be halal certified by October 2039. Stakeholders have expressed concern over the administration of the system, which they contend has lacked adequate consultative processes and does not follow internationally negotiated halal systems. State Trading Presidential Regulation No. 66/2021 established Indonesia’s National Food Agency (BAPANAS). BAPANAS as a minister-level institution that directly reports to the Indonesian President and has the authority to coordinate all food- and agriculture-related ministries and agencies, such as the MOA, MOT, MOI, and the state-owned procurement body the Bureau of Logistics (BULOG). Indonesia imposes restrictions on feed corn imports, limiting the right to import to BULOG. However, some corn imports intended for starch manufacturing are allowed. As Indonesia’s sole importer of feed corn, BULOG prioritizes corn distribution to small-holder poultry farmers. The import volume is set based on the level of domestic feed production and subject to the commodity balance policy. Feed millers other than the small-holders who receive corn from BULOG are obligated to use locally-produced feed corn. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-223-2048.jpg) ![216 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS They have expressed concern that they are unable to obtain feed corn in quantities sufficient to maintain the poultry industry’s growth. BULOG also maintains exclusive authority to import standard 15 percent to 25 percent broken rice. Indonesia has cited food security and price management considerations as the principal objectives of this policy. BULOG is not allowed to import rice before, during, or immediately after the main harvest period. Private firms are only allowed to import 100 percent broken rice for processing or specialty rice varieties, such as basmati and jasmine rice, for retail and food service. Importers of 100 percent broken and specialty rice must first obtain an importer identification number from MOT and an import recommendation from MOA before obtaining import licenses from MOT. Presidential Regulation No. 125/2022 on Government Food Reserves states that BULOG is appointed as Indonesia’s sole importer of rice, feed corn, and soybeans for government food reserves. Additionally, through MOT Regulations No. 57/2017 and No. 7/2020, and BAPANAS Regulation No. 5/2022, the Indonesian Government sets farmer-level and consumer-level reference prices for corn, soybeans, sugar, shallots, beef, chicken, eggs, and cooking oil, respectively. According to these regulations, BULOG and other state-owned enterprises can intervene in the market when prices are above or below threshold targets. In 2024, BAPANAS tasked BULOG with importing 750,000 metric tons (MT) of feed corn, of which 252,000 MT arrived by August 2024. BAPANAS also tasked BULOG to import soybeans for 2024 government soybean reserves. On November 5, 2024, the President issued Regulation No. 147 of 2024 which assigned Coordinating Ministry for Food Affairs (CMFA) to replace Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) in overseeing and coordinating the implementation of the commodity balance process for agricultural commodities. CMFA will also oversee the procurement of food commodities such as rice and beef to address shortages in production and to meet consumer demand during festive months. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation U.S. firms regularly report challenges with Indonesian customs practices, particularly with assessment of import duties. Indonesian customs officials often rely on a schedule of reference prices rather than using transaction values as the primary method of valuation, as required by the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement (CVA). Further, U.S. exporters report differing valuation determinations in different regions for the same product. In addition, MOT Regulation No. 16/2021 requires pre-shipment verification by designated companies (known in Indonesia as surveyors) for a broad range of products. These include: electronics; textiles and footwear; toys; food and beverage products; and, cosmetics. As of December 31, 2024, Indonesia had yet to notify these measures to the WTO pursuant to the WTO Agreement on Preshipment Inspection. MOF Regulation No. 190/PMK.04/2022, in force since January 14, 2023, establishes customs operations for intangible goods such as electronic transmissions or downloads, including procedural requirements and classification under Chapter 99 of the Indonesian tariff schedule. Stakeholders report that the regulation creates significant administrative burdens on U.S. industries by imposing a new paperwork retention requirement that is undefined and uncertain. The United States has been raising its concerns about this measure at the WTO Committee on Trade Facilitation since June 2023. With regard to penalties assessed for breaches of customs law, Indonesian customs agents can receive rewards of up to 50 percent of the value of the item seized or of the duty-amount owed. Under the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, Indonesia must avoid creating incentives for the assessment or collection of penalties greater than those commensurate with the degree and severity of the breach. Indonesia is one of ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-224-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 217 only a few major U.S. trading partners that still has such an incentive system. The system is a cause of concern due to the potential for corruption and the cost, uncertainty, and lack of transparency associated with the customs penalty and reward system. Indonesia notified its customs valuation legislation to the WTO in September 2001, but has not yet responded to the WTO Checklist of Issues that describes how the Customs Valuation Agreement is being implemented. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Standards and Testing Requirements MOI Regulation No. 24/2013, as amended by MOI Regulations No. 55/2013 and No. 29/2018, requires that imported toys be tested by a laboratory with a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) with one of Indonesia’s product certification bodies. The United States is not aware of any existing MRAs, leaving imported toys subject to mandatory testing in Indonesia in order to obtain certification. U.S. stakeholders have expressed concern about the discriminatory frequency of testing under these regulations, which is required on a per shipment basis for imports but only every six months for domestically produced products. MOI Regulation No. 29/2018 introduced an alternative procedure that allows importers to obtain a certification through product testing and an audit of production processes. Indonesia notified this measure to the WTO in November 2018. U.S. manufacturers remain concerned by the lack of clarity about how products can enter the market under the alternative procedure. Government Regulation (GR) No. 28/2021 requires in-country conformity assessment testing for a wide variety of consumer goods including toys, electronics, and home appliances. GR No. 28/2021 requires that all steps of product testing be conducted by an Indonesian national residing in Indonesia, further complicating product sample collection for products that use a per shipment testing scheme. The implementing regulation to GR No. 28/2021, MOI Regulation No. 45/2022, entered into force in November 2022, two months prior to its notification to the WTO in January 2023. U.S. stakeholders have reported that the requirements under GR No. 28/2021 have made conformity assessment processes more difficult. Halal Import Requirements Under Law No. 33/2014, on Halal Product Assurance, halal certification is mandatory for food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, medical devices, biological products, genetically engineered products, consumer goods, and chemical products sold in Indonesia. All business processes, including production, storage, packaging, distribution, and marketing, are covered by this law. As Indonesia continues to develop regulations to implement this law, U.S. stakeholders are concerned that Indonesia finalized many such regulations before notifying the draft measures to the WTO and taking stakeholder comments into account, as required under the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and as recommended by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (WTO TBT Committee). Indeed, over the past five years, Indonesia has demonstrated a pattern of notifying Halal Law implementing measures to the WTO only after they have already entered into force. This includes some of the key implementing measures that are detailed below. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-225-2048.jpg) ![218 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Minister of Religious Affairs (MORA) Decree No. 748/2021 outlines a broad range of products requiring halal certification. This regulation was amended by MORA Decree No. 944/2024 for the food and beverage category. Other product types, such as drugs, cosmetics, genetically engineered products, chemical products, biology products, and consumer goods still refer to MORA Decree No. 748/2021. MORA Decree No. 1360/2021, also known as the halal “positive list,” sets out a list of foods, ingredients, additives, and other materials that are not required to obtain halal certification. It is a living document, meaning it can be amended without requiring the issuance of a new decree. MORA Decree No. 816/2024 identifies specific food and beverage products (by HS code) required to be halal certified. Halal Product Assurance Organizing Agency (“BPJPH”) Regulation No. 3/2023 concerns the accreditation of foreign halal certifying bodies (HCBs) and the conformity assessments they must complete. The United States is concerned that the accreditation regulations create redundant document requests, increasingly onerous requirements for auditors to qualify, and an arbitrary scope-to-auditor ratio policy, all of which are increasing costs and unnecessarily delaying accreditation procedures for U.S. HCBs seeking to become accredited to issue halal certificates for U.S. exports to Indonesia. The final step in obtaining recognition is for each HCB to conclude a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) with BPJPH and receive a certificate of accreditation. GR No. 39/2021 maintains the original timeline for phasing in mandatory halal certification, including for: food and beverage products (by October 2024); traditional medicines and food supplements, cosmetics, chemical products, and genetically modified organisms, wearable clothing items, household appliances, office products, and class A medical devices (by October 2026); over-the-counter medicines and class B medical devices (by October 2029); and prescription medicines and class C medical devices (by October 2034). In January 2023, Presidential Decree 6/2023, on Halal Certification of Medicines, Biological Product, and Medical Devices, was issued, requiring class D medical devices to be halal certified by October 2039. On October 18, 2024, the GOI issued GR No. 42/2024, amending GR No. 39/2021 and extending the deadline “up to” October 17, 2026, for imported food and beverages (with certain caveats). The regulation provides for the Minister of Religious Affairs to determine the precise date for the extension. The United States continues to raise concerns with the implementing regulations for Law No. 33/2014 at the WTO TBT Committee and WTO Committee on Trade in Goods. Product Testing Indonesia’s National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM) sets out requirements for testing of heavy metals in cosmetics in its Regulation No. 12/2019, which replaced Regulation No. 17/2014. A 2016 BPOM Circular Letter further clarified these requirements, mandating that they be fulfilled via a certificate of analysis, which remains valid for one year. In practice, despite the certificate’s year-long validity, Indonesia’s Directorate General of Customs and Excise requires that each individual shipment be accompanied by a separate, distinct test, in effect adding a repetitive layer of compliance. These measures appear to be intended to limit imports. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Facility Registration for Animal-Derived Products Indonesia’s animal health and husbandry law (Law No. 18/2009, as amended by Law No. 41/2014) requires companies that export to Indonesia animal‐derived products, such as meat, dairy, and eggs, to complete a pre‐registration process with the MOA. The law allows imports of these products only from facilities that Indonesian authorities have individually approved. MOA Regulation No. 15/2021 maintains this ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-226-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 219 requirement and adds a new provision requiring raw materials used for the manufacturing of animal-derived products to originate from facilities that have already been approved by Indonesia. Under MOA Regulation No. 15/2021, all establishments seeking to export animal products to Indonesia must undergo inspections to obtain eligibility certificates. As part of this process, and based on GR No. 28/2023, the MOA charges fees for a desk audit of application materials, an on-site facility inspection, and a post-audit desk review. Among all trading partners’ registration requirements, U.S. exporters identify Indonesia’s as the most burdensome. Dairy production facilities are required to pass lengthy technical desk audits but not the on-site audits required of other animal products. Other facilities (i.e., meat and rendering) are required to undergo on-site facility inspections and post-audit desk reviews. Indonesia charges fees for transportation and lodging costs for MOA officials conducting inspections in the United States. In total, companies seeking to export to Indonesia could pay more than $10,000 for each facility’s onsite inspection and post-audit desk review. Many of the U.S. companies affected are small businesses that report that the fee is a significant barrier. Recognition of the U.S. Food Safety Control System for Fresh Foods of Plant Origin (FFPO) The GOI currently recognizes the U.S. Food Safety Control System for Fresh Food of Plant Origin (FFPO), which exempts U.S. exporters of covered products from many of the GAP, GHP, and statement letter requirements faced by non-recognized countries. This FFPO recognition was first granted in 2009 and must be renewed every three years. The current recognition is set to expire on January 16, 2027. In January 2024, U.S. apples were unjustifiably excluded from the scope of the FFPO recognition renewal in 2023 due to a questionable non-compliance finding in one shipment of U.S. apples on July 26, 2022. The U.S. Government and the importer were only notified of the finding several months later. After months of high- level engagement between the United States and Indonesia, on October 16, 2024, the Indonesian Quarantine Authority (IQA) officially confirmed it reinstated apples to the list of U.S. Fresh Foods of Plant Origin (FFPO) recognition under IQA Decree No. 8014/2024. With the reinstatement of apples, Indonesia now recognizes the food safety of 79 types of U.S. FFPO products. However, prior to January 2024, Indonesia previously recognized 88 commodities. IQA removed nine FFPOs, including carrots, melons, pecans, and spinach, from the scope of the recognition due to the United States not having previously exported these products to Indonesia in substantial quantities, not due to science-based food safety findings. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Indonesia grants special preferences to encourage domestic sourcing and to maximize the use of domestic production in government procurement. It also instructs government departments, institutes, and corporations to utilize domestic goods and services to the maximum extent feasible. Presidential Regulations No. 54/2010 (as amended by Regulation No. 12/2021) and No. 38/2015 both require procuring entities to maximize domestic production in procurement, use foreign components only when necessary, and designate foreign contractors as subcontractors to local companies. Both regulations provide general minimum requirements (40 percent under Regulation No. 12/2021) for domestic production and service provision. Depending on the sector or nature of the project, ministries with authority over the project may impose additional restrictions or requirements. Specific to the medical device sector, in 2021 with the aim of increasing domestic production, the Indonesian Government suspended imports of 79 medical device product categories from the government’s electronic catalog (e-Katalog) with minimal notice and without prior stakeholder consultation. Since that time, U.S. stakeholders have frequently raised concerns about their products being withheld from public hospital purchases under the e-Katalog and requested the Indonesian Government allow a sufficient grace ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-227-2048.jpg) ![220 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS period for the transition to local production, assuring patient access to safe and high-quality medical devices. Indonesia’s 2012 Defense Law and Presidential Regulation No. 76/2014 mandate a priority preference for domestic materials and components in defense procurement, requiring defense agencies to prioritize domestically produced goods and services whenever available. In addition, when an Indonesian Government entity procures from a foreign defense supplier due to lack of available products from an Indonesian supplier, there is a requirement for trade balancing offsets. These offsets may take various forms, including the incorporation of domestic production, production offsets, technology transfer, or a combination of these elements. While this regulatory framework seeks to bolster opportunities for local industry, the framework also poses challenges for foreign defense companies, which must navigate complex offset obligations in order to participate in the Indonesian market. Indonesia is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since October 2012. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Indonesia remains on the Priority Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. Although Indonesia has recently taken steps to improve intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, including expanding an IP enforcement task force and increasing efforts to address online piracy, significant concerns remain. Widespread copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting (including online and in physical markets) are key concerns. The Mangga Dua Market in Jakarta continues to be listed in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List), along with multiple online Indonesian marketplaces. Lack of enforcement remains a problem, and the United States urges Indonesia to utilize the IP enforcement task force to improve enforcement cooperation among relevant law enforcement agencies and ministries. The United States also continues to encourage Indonesia to provide an effective system for protection against the unfair commercial use, in addition to unauthorized disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products. The United States also remains concerned about Indonesia’s law regarding geographical indications. In March 2023, Indonesia amended its 2016 Patent Law through the Omnibus Law on Job Creation to modify requirements for patents to be worked in Indonesia so that the requirements can be met by importation or licensing. The United States had urged Indonesia to undertake a more comprehensive amendment to the 2016 Patent Law to address remaining concerns about the Patent Law, including by clarifying the patentability of inventions that incorporate computer programs and by clarifying how applicants can comply with disclosure requirements for inventions related to traditional knowledge and genetic resources. The United States also continues to urge Indonesia to fully implement the bilateral Intellectual Property Rights Work Plan and plans continued engagement with Indonesia under the United States–Indonesia TIFA to address these issues. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-228-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 221 SERVICES BARRIERS Audiovisual Services Indonesia’s 2009 Film Law imposes a 60 percent screen quota for Indonesian films.

Express Delivery Services Indonesian law requires that suppliers of intercity courier and express delivery services be majority owned by Indonesians and that foreign suppliers limit their activities to provincial capitals with international airports and seaports. Financial Services The Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) Regulation No. 56/03/2016 limits bank ownership to no more than 40 percent by any single shareholder, applicable to foreign and domestic shareholders. In certain cases, OJK may grant exceptions to this general rule. Based on OJK Regulation No. 12/POJK.03/2021, OJK increased the foreign equity cap for commercial banks to 99 percent with prior assessment from the banking supervisor unit at OJK. Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), restricts foreign ownership in private credit reporting firms to 49 percent under BI Circular Letter No. 15/49/DPKL. Under BI Regulation No. 18/40/PBI/2016 on payment transaction processing operations, BI limits foreign ownership of payment companies to 20 percent (but exempts existing investments that exceed this foreign equity limitation). BI Regulation No. 19/08/2017 on the National Payment Gateway (NPG) requires all domestic retail debit and credit transactions to be processed through NPG switching institutions located in Indonesia and licensed by BI. The regulation imposes a 20 percent foreign equity limitation on firms that wish to obtain a switching license to participate in the NPG, prohibiting the cross-border supply of electronic payment services for domestic retail debit and credit card transactions. BI Regulation No. 19/10/PADG/2017 mandates that foreign firms form partnership agreements with licensed Indonesian NPG switches in order to process domestic retail transactions through the NPG. BI must approve such agreements, and the regulation makes approval contingent on the foreign partner firm supporting development of the domestic industry, including by technology transfer. Under BI Regulation No. 21/2019, Indonesia established national standards (termed QRIS, or Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard) for all payments using QR codes in Indonesia. U.S. companies, including payment providers and banks, noted concern that during BI’s QR code policymaking process, international stakeholders were neither informed of the nature of the potential changes nor given an opportunity to explain their views on such a system, including how it might be designed to interact most seamlessly with existing payment systems. Indonesia issued BI Regulation No. 22/23/PBI/2020, effective July 2021, to implement BI’s 2025 Payment System Blueprint.

The regulation implemented an 85 percent foreign ownership cap for non-bank payment service operators, also known as front-end payment companies, but foreign investors ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-229-2048.jpg) ![222 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS may only hold 49 percent of voting shares. The foreign ownership cap for payment system infrastructure operators, or back-end companies, remains at 20 percent. Stakeholders have expressed concern regarding BI’s lack of consultation prior to issuance of regulations. In May 2023, BI mandated that government credit cards be processed through the NPG and required the use and issuance of local government credit cards. U.S. payment companies are concerned the new policy will limit access to the use of U.S. electronic payment options. Health Services Problematic sectoral regulations remain in place in the healthcare sector, including regulations that require foreign-owned hospitals to have more inpatient beds than is required for domestic hospitals. Franchising and Retail Distribution Services Under MOT Regulation No. 71/2019, retail companies operating in Indonesia are required to prioritize the use of domestic goods and services unless domestic products do not meet a franchisor’s quality standards. MOT Regulation No. 23/2021 further requires modern shops to set aside promotion areas for products produced by micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and requires business owners with more than 150 stores to franchise their businesses. Barriers to retail services through electronic commerce are identified in the “Internet Services” section below. Telecommunications Services Indonesia has issued a number of measures that make it difficult to import cellular and Wi-Fi equipped products. Under MOT Regulation 36/202 as amended, most recently by MOT Regulation 8/2024, importers are required to become a registered importer to sell directly to retailers or consumers. To qualify for an MOT import license, Indonesia requires importers to provide evidence of contributions to the development of the domestic device industry or evidence of cooperation with domestic manufacturing, design, or research firms. Companies seeking to import 4G and beyond technology-enabled devices may only do so under a producer’s license (API-P), which is generally held by importers of unfinished goods intended for use in the manufacturing process, limiting the ability of foreign producers to sell these devices in Indonesia. Importers are also required to submit product identification numbers and a corresponding certificate from the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT). Industry stakeholders have complained that it takes months to get a decision on license requests. U.S. companies have reported that, in some cases, the MOI is informally limiting import quantities under existing licenses (issued under MOI Regulation No. 38/2024) to protect locally manufactured cell phones, handheld computers, and tablets. Importers of any type of cell phone, handheld computer, or tablet are also subject to MOI Regulation No. 68/2016, which requires importers to obtain an MOI recommendation to establish themselves as registered importers of such devices. A recommendation is only available for local manufacturers, importers in a joint venture with a local manufacturer, or importers of specialized items. Altogether, Indonesia’s licensing practices impose significant barriers on the importation of cellphones, handheld devices, and other electronic devices. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-230-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 223 ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Digital Products Regulation 17/2018 establishes five HS lines at the eight-digit level (with import duty rates currently set at zero percent) for software and other digital products transmitted electronically, including applications, software, video, and audio. Despite zero tariffs, companies have expressed concern over the potential administrative burden of this new regulation, including potential customs documentation or reporting requirements. The MOF has indicated that any data reporting under this system will be voluntary. Imposition of any duties on digital products under this regulation would raise serious concerns regarding Indonesia’s longstanding WTO commitment, renewed on a multilateral basis in December 2019, not to impose duties on electronic transmissions. In addition, using a tariff schedule for the application of such duties on non-physical products raises fundamental questions and challenges related to the harmonized tariff system, the role of customs authorities in the digital space, and the determination of country of origin for electronic transmissions. Internet Services GR No. 71/2019 (GR 71) requires private sector electronic system operators (ESOs) to facilitate supervision by government agencies, including by granting access to electronic systems and data for monitoring and law enforcement purposes. The MCIT issued implementing regulations for GR 71, Regulations No. 5/2020 and No. 10/2021, which require private sector ESOs, including those providing services on a cross-border basis, to register with the MCIT. ESOs that fail to register or comply with government takedown orders for a potentially broad category of prohibited electronic information may be subject to access blocking. Industry stakeholders, including U.S. stakeholders, have voiced concerns over the lack of clarity regarding what content falls within the scope of prohibited content, the lack of an appeal and adjudication mechanism, and the limited notice and turnaround time for ESOs to respond to takedown requests from the MCIT. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Presidential Regulation No. 10/2021, as amended by Presidential Regulation No. 49/2021, liberalized foreign investment in Indonesia by repealing the 2016 Negative List of Investment but identifies certain sectors that remain subject to foreign ownership limitations. Foreign investment is limited to 49 percent for enterprises engaged in publishing newspapers and magazines, postal services, and air, land, and sea transportation. Foreign investment is limited to 20 percent for broadcasting service suppliers and certain financial service suppliers. Foreign investment is prohibited for certain activities such as fish processing and shipbuilding. In addition, sectors and activities open to 100 percent foreign ownership following the repeal of the Negative List of Investment may still be subject to limitations and conditions imposed by the relevant ministry. GR No. 96/2021, as amended by GR No. 25/2024, requires foreign companies that obtain mining licenses to divest 51 percent of their holdings to Indonesian ownership. Foreign mining companies without integrated processing facilities have 15 years to divest, while companies with integrated processing facilities have 20 years to divest. SUBSIDIES Indonesia has not submitted a subsidy notification to the WTO under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures since 2019 and has only made one such notification since joining the WTO in 1995. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-231-2048.jpg) ![224 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS According to the WTO Secretariat Report on Indonesia’s 2020 Trade Policy Review, Indonesia continues to provide fiscal and non-fiscal incentives for manufacturing and exports in connection with its export processing zones and special economic zones programs. These include incentives related to corporate income tax, property tax, import duty, value-added tax, excise and luxury taxes, and local taxes, in addition to assistance on land acquisition, licensing, investment, and labor. Non-tax incentives in the form of loans and interest rate subsidies continue to be available mainly to domestic MSMEs. Additionally, Indonesia provides various forms of official export financing, insurance, and guarantees through the state-owned Indonesia Eximbank and Asuransi Ekspor Indonesia. The United States will continue to urge Indonesia to submit a WTO notification for all of its subsidy programs. OTHER BARRIERS Although the Indonesian Government and the Corruption Eradication Commission investigate and prosecute high-profile corruption cases, many stakeholders continue to view corruption as a significant barrier to doing business in Indonesia. Other barriers to trade and investment include: poor coordination within the Indonesian Government; the slow pace of land acquisition for infrastructure development projects; poor enforcement of contracts; an uncertain regulatory and legal framework; inconsistent tax assessments; and lack of transparency in the development of laws and regulations. U.S. stakeholders seeking legal relief in contract disputes have reported that they are often forced to litigate spurious counterclaims and have raised growing concern about the criminalization of contractual disputes. Export Restrictions As part of the implementation of the 2009 Mining Law (as amended by the 2020 Mining Law), Indonesia prohibits the export of certain ores, including nickel, bauxite, copper, and tin. The United States is concerned about the impact of these measures on steel, aluminum, and other sectors and their contribution to global overcapacity. On December 11, 2019, the United States requested to join consultations initiated by the European Union concerning the consistency of the export ban with Indonesia’s WTO obligations and participated in subsequent panel proceedings as a third party. The panel report in this dispute was circulated on November 30, 2022; the panel found Indonesia’s export ban on nickel ore to be inconsistent with its WTO obligations. Indonesia filed a notice of appeal on December 12, 2022. In the oil and gas sector, some production-sharing contracts and gross split contracts in Indonesia contain a clause specifying that 25 percent of all production must be sold to domestic refineries for domestic consumption. The policy, known as the Domestic Market Obligation, also requires companies to sell the crude oil to domestic refineries at a heavily discounted rate. Energy and Mining In the oil and gas sector, GR No. 79/2010, as amended by GR No. 27/2017 and GR No. 93/2021, grants the Indonesian government significant authority to alter the terms of production-sharing contracts. Aspects of contract the government can revise include criteria for cost recovery and tax provisions. The ability of the government to modify such terms introduces additional operational complexity, uncertainty, risk, and costs to oil and gas projects. In addition, the government can also impose on oil and gas companies a maximum amount for costs that can be claimed, such as salaries and goods and services—thereby limiting firms’ flexibility in hiring and procurement. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-232-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 225 Local Content Indonesia imposes a number of local content requirements on certain information and communication technologies in order to sell such products in Indonesia. 4G-LTE enabled devices must contain 35 percent local content and 4G-LTE base stations must contain 40 percent local content; equipment used in certain wireless broadband services must contain local content of at least 30 percent for subscriber stations and at least 40 percent for base stations; all wireless equipment must contain 50 percent local content; and certain TV and set-top boxes must contain at least 20 percent local content. In addition, there are local content requirements for wavelength division multiplexing and internet protocol network devices. These requirements limit U.S. companies’ ability to sell various telecommunication and electronic products in the Indonesian market. The United States continues to press Indonesia to remove these barriers. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-233-2048.jpg) ![226 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS ISRAEL TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Israel Free Trade Agreement The United States–Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force on August 19, 1985. Israel implemented phased tariff reductions, culminating in the complete elimination of duties on all non- agricultural products by January 1, 1995. While Israel has eliminated tariffs on non-agricultural goods as agreed, tariff and non-tariff barriers continue to affect a significant number of key U.S. agricultural product exports. To address the differing views between the two countries over how the FTA applies to trade in agricultural products, in 1996 the United States and Israel signed an Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products (ATAP), which established a program of gradual and steady market access liberalization for food and agricultural products effective through December 31, 2001. The United States and Israel completed negotiation and implementation of a successor ATAP in 2004, which granted improved access for select U.S. agricultural products. Originally scheduled to last through December 31, 2008, the 2004 ATAP has been extended 17 times, most recently through December 31, 2025, to allow time for the negotiation of a successor agreement. The current ATAP provides U.S. food and agricultural products access to the Israeli market under one of three categories: unlimited duty-free access, duty-free tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), or preferential tariffs, which are set at least 10 percent below Israel’s Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) rates. The United States and Israel meet regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the FTA and to address outstanding issues. The United States–Israel Joint Committee is the central oversight body for the FTA and last met on May 24, 2023. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Israel’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 3.6 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Israel’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 13.7 percent for agricultural products and 2.4 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Israel has bound 75.6 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 22.3 percent. U.S. food and agricultural exports that do not enter duty free under WTO, FTA, or ATAP provisions face barriers, such as high tariffs and a complicated TRQ system. These products include higher-value goods that are sensitive for the Israeli agricultural sector, such as dairy products, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, almonds, wine, fresh and frozen fish, and some processed foods. In 2022, Israel’s Ministry of Finance issued a decree that began a gradual reduction or elimination of tariffs on many agricultural products, including dairy, meat, fresh fruit, and vegetables as part of the Israeli Government’s agricultural reform. Stakeholders estimate that full market access in agriculture could result in increases in U.S. exports to Israel of a variety of agricultural products. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-234-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 227 TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade On August 4, 2024, Israel adopted amendments to the Standards Law (no. 19) 5784-2024, Import and Export Decree (no. 6) 5784-2024, Energy Sources Law (no. 5) 5784-2024, and the Protection of Public Health Law (no. 9) 5784-2024 allowing for imported goods to be self-certified as consistent with European Union (EU) technical regulations and standards. In contrast, imported goods that are manufactured consistent with U.S. technical regulations and standards require additional regulatory approval by the Standards Institution of Israel. The legislation will apply to the import of dozens of consumer products, including agricultural goods. U.S. industry stakeholders have expressed concerns that the amendments incentivize importers to purchase products that are first-party-certified to European technical regulations and standards rather than U.S. produced goods. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers U.S. industry has confirmed that the 40 newly-adopted regulations under the Protection of Public Health (Food Law) will affect many U.S. agricultural exports to Israel. The legislation was implemented on January 1, 2025, and is subject to changes and transition periods. Furthermore, access to updates in the legislation or proposed/revised implementation dates (in draft form) are only accessible to those subscribed to the Nevo Legal Database, a comprehensive online legal database owned by a non-government entity that includes up-to-date full text of primary and subsidiary legislation and historical chronology of amendments. As a result, Israeli importers heavily rely on law firms that subscribe to the database to remain informed of implementation dates. This creates a lack of clarity for U.S. exporters to understand future Israeli regulatory requirements for manufacturing and exporting agricultural goods to Israel. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Israel has offset requirements that it implements through international cooperation (IC) agreements. Under IC agreements, foreign companies that have been awarded government contracts are required to offset foreign goods or services provided under the contracts by agreeing to localization commitments that require one of the following: (1) investment in local industry; (2) co-development or co-production with local companies; (3) subcontracting to local companies; or (4) purchasing from Israeli industry. Israel is a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). Since January 1, 2009, the IC offset percentage for procurements covered by Israel’s GPA obligations has been 20 percent of the value of the contract, 35 percent for procurements excluded from GPA coverage, and 50 percent for military procurements. Under the revised GPA, which entered into force in 2014, Israel is required to eliminate offsets for GPA covered procurement by 2029. U.S. suppliers are at a disadvantage in principle because of sizeable offset requirements that remain in the interim period, despite an Israeli court decision that prohibits the consideration of offset proposals in determining the award of a contract. Small and medium-sized U.S. exporters often are reluctant to commit to making purchases in Israel in compliance with the IC agreements. As a result, their participation in Israeli tenders is limited. The inclusion of unlimited liability clauses in many government tenders discourages U.S. firms from competing. When faced with the possibility of significant legal costs for unforeseeable problems resulting ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-235-2048.jpg) ![228 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS from a government contract, most U.S. firms choose to insure against the risk, which raises their overall bid price and reduces their competitiveness, as compared to bids from Israeli firms. The United States–Israel Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is intended to facilitate defense cooperation and trade, in part by allowing companies from both countries to compete on defense procurements in both countries on as equal a basis as possible, consistent with national laws and regulations. The MOU has benefited Israeli defense industries by opening up the U.S. procurement market by waiving Buy American to Department of Defense procurement for Israeli products. In contrast, the MOU has not opened the Israeli Ministry of Defense procurements market for U.S. suppliers because of requirements to retain local agents or bank accounts to conduct transactions in New Israeli Shekels. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Data Localization Requirements Data protection in Israel is governed primarily by the Protection of Privacy Law (5741-1981) and the guidelines of the Israeli regulator, the Privacy Protection Authority. Similar to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, Israeli law restricts the cross-border transfer of personal data of Israelis unless certain specific criteria are met, such as the use of standard contract clauses. Since July 2023, Israel recognizes the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework as a valid mechanism to meet Israeli requirements for the protection of personal data. (For further information on the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework, see the Electronic Commerce / Digital Trade Barriers section of the EU Chapter of this NTE Report.) ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-236-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 229 JAPAN TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA) and the United States–Japan Digital Trade Agreement (USJDTA) entered into force on January 1, 2020. The United States and Japan continue to monitor implementation of these agreements. On March 28, 2023, the United States and Japan signed the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Japan on Strengthening Critical Minerals Supply Chains (Agreement). The Agreement will strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains and promote the adoption of electric vehicle battery technologies. In particular, the Agreement formalizes the shared commitment of the United States and Japan with respect to the critical minerals sector to facilitate trade, promote fair competition and market-oriented conditions for trade in critical minerals, advance robust labor and environmental commitments, and cooperate in efforts to ensure secure, sustainable, and equitable critical minerals supply chains. The Agreement entered into force immediately upon signature. The United States continues to urge Japan to remove a broad range of barriers to U.S. exports, including barriers at the border, as well as other barriers to entering and expanding the presence of U.S. products and services in the Japanese market. The United States continues to utilize the United States-Japan Partnership on Trade mechanism as an important vehicle for raising bilateral trade concerns. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Japan’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 3.7 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Japan’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 12.2 percent for agricultural products and 2.4 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Japan has bound 99.7 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 4.1 percent. While Japan’s average MFN applied tariffs are relatively low for non-agricultural products, certain high tariffs have a negative impact on a range of U.S. industrial goods exports to Japan, such as chemicals, fish, wood products, and jewelry. Japan is the fourth largest single-country market for U.S. agricultural products, with U.S. agricultural exports valued at approximately $12 billion in 2024, despite the existence of tariff and substantial non-tariff market access barriers. While the USJTA removed or reduced tariffs on approximately 90 percent of U.S. food and agricultural exports, there are several important products for which tariffs remain high and limit U.S. market access, including: rice and rice products; certain dairy products; beverages, including mineral waters and fruit juices; processed foods, including chocolate and sweetened cocoa powder; table grapes; fresh strawberries; frozen blueberries; tangerines and mandarins; sugar; and pet food. Fish and Seafood U.S. fish and seafood exports to Japan totaled $568 million in 2024. However, tariffs of up to 10 percent on several fish and seafood products, such as pollock, herring, salmon, whiting, cod, and fish oil, hamper U.S. exports and reduce margins of Japanese importers who rely on U.S. raw product for their processing operations. Other market access issues include Japan’s import quotas on Alaska pollock and surimi, cod, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-237-2048.jpg) ![230 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Pacific whiting, mackerel, sardines, squid, herring, pollock roe, cod roe, scallops, and kelp. While Japan has reduced tariffs, increased import quota volumes, and eased the administrative burdens associated with those quotas, the remaining import quotas and tariffs continue to present barriers to U.S. exports. U.S. companies report that the process of obtaining quota allocation is expensive and subject to frequent delays. The United States has urged Japan to take further action to reduce and eliminate obstacles to U.S. exports of fish and seafood. Leather and Footwear Japan maintains high tariffs on leather, footwear, and travel goods, ranging from 3.5 percent to an ad valorem equivalent of approximately 130 percent on certain footwear imported from the United States. For example, Japan continues to apply tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) to a limited and tightly controlled volume of leather footwear imports. The tariffs on out-of-quota imports are either 30 percent or ¥ (yen) 4,300 (approximately $28) per pair, whichever is higher. These tariffs can more than double the cost of imports and negatively affect market access for U.S.-made footwear. Japan also applies TRQs on some raw hides and skins. The United States continues to seek improved market access for U.S. exports in this sector. Non-Tariff Barriers Rice Japan’s highly regulated and nontransparent system of importation and distribution for rice limits the ability of U.S. exporters to have meaningful access to Japan’s consumers. Japan has established a global TRQ of 682,200 metric tons (on a milled basis) for imported rice. The Grain Trade and Operations Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) Crop Production Bureau manages the TRQ through periodic ordinary minimum access (OMA) tenders and through simultaneous-buy-sell (SBS) tenders. Imports of U.S. rice under the OMA tenders are destined almost exclusively for government stocks. The MAFF releases these stocks exclusively for non-table rice uses, such as industrial food processing, animal feed, and re-export as food aid. Under SBS tenders, only a small amount of U.S. rice imported into Japan—still identifiable as U.S. rice—reaches Japanese consumers. In recent years, SBS tenders have not been filled due partly to the non-market-based price markup that the MAFF imposes on TRQ imports. Although Japan asserts that the markup is set using supply and demand figures and world pricing, it had not changed the markup of ¥61 per kilogram (approximately $0.40/kg) for six years, between Japan Fiscal Year (JFY) 2018 and JFY 2023. However, in the JFY 2024 third SBS tender in November, the markup reached the maximum allowable level of ¥292 per kilogram (approximately $1.93/kg), reflecting strong import demand. U.S. rice exports currently make up only about 3 percent of all rice consumed in Japan. The United States will continue to monitor Japan’s rice import system in light of Japan’s WTO import commitments and engage with Japan on its SBS markup for rice. Wheat Japan requires food wheat to be imported through the Grain Trade and Operations Division of the MAFF’s Crop Production Bureau to secure the lowest tariff rate. The Crop Production Bureau resells the wheat to Japanese flour millers at prices substantially above import prices by imposing a markup. The United States continues to carefully monitor Japan’s operation of its state trading entity for wheat and its potential to distort trade. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-238-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 231 Pork U.S. pork exports to Japan are subject to a trade-distorting “gate price mechanism” that functions as a variable levy. To prevent lower-priced imports from competing with Japanese pork, the mechanism levies progressively higher duties on lower-priced imports. For instance, chilled and frozen pork are subject to a specific duty of up to ¥125 per kilogram (approximately $0.83 per kilogram) based on the difference between the actual import value and a government-established reference price. This duty is in addition to an ad valorem duty that is charged on all chilled and frozen pork, regardless of import value. With the implementation of the USJTA, the variable levy under the pork gate price mechanism is being reduced over time for U.S. pork, but not eliminated. Ethanol: On Road Biofuels In April 2023, Japan implemented a revised Biofuels Standard that will allow the United States to provide up to 100 percent of Japan’s annual on-road biofuels target of 500 million liters crude oil equivalent. The new Biofuels Standard held constant the annual biofuels target volume, which has remained unchanged since 2017. In April 2025, Japan plans to form an “on-road” fuel expert working group to further develop regulatory policies and standards. The United States continues to urge Japan to increase its annual biofuels target volume to a level that would allow Japan to achieve at least an E3 blend rate (gasoline containing 3 percent bioethanol). In November 2024, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced plans to introduce direct blending of biofuels with gasoline as fuel for on-road vehicles. Under the draft policy, oil distributors would begin supplying fuels mixed with up to 10 percent ethanol by 2030 and 20 percent ethanol by 2040. Ethanol: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) In June 2023, METI announced plans to implement a target volume of 1.7 billion liters for SAF consumption in Japan by 2030. Japan has a strong interest in using ethanol to produce SAF. However, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) current carbon intensity scoring model for U.S. corn ethanol requires updating to accurately reflect indirect land use change criteria. The current scoring model could negatively impact U.S. corn ethanol as a feedstock for Japan’s future SAF production. METI will hold expert committee meetings to continue discussions of the agreed upon SAF regulatory framework as soon as April 2025. In December 2024, Japan completed their first commercial SAF production plant in Osaka with the aim to begin sales to airlines in March 2025. The United States continues to cooperate with the Government of Japan on the use of SAF and ethanol, including through technical workshops and bilateral discussions such as under the U.S.-Japan Partnership on Trade. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Expanding Japan’s advance rulings system to address more customs issues would improve transparency and predictability for U.S. exporters. The United States continues to urge Japan to improve the speed of customs processing and to reduce the complexity of customs and border procedures. In particular, U.S. exporters continue to seek the coordinated pre-arrival processing by all border agencies of any shipment, by any mode of transportation, for which customs data is submitted sufficiently early. (For further information on the treatment of international express delivery suppliers, see the Services Barriers section.) ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-239-2048.jpg) ![232 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Food Safety Regulatory Oversight As part of an overall effort to streamline management of issues relating to health and infectious disease the Government of Japan shifted its food safety standard administration (under the Food Sanitation Act) from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to the Consumer Affairs Agency on April 1, 2024. However, responsibility for monitoring and inspection of domestic and imported foods will remain with the MHLW. The United States will monitor implementation and development of regulations to ensure continued science-based regulatory decision-making and a level playing field for U.S. exports of food products to Japan. Pre- and Post-Harvest Fungicides Japan classifies fungicides applied pre-harvest as pesticides and classifies fungicides applied post‐harvest as food additives. These different classifications based on the time of application lack a discernable science- based rationale. Because post-harvest fungicides are classified as food additives, Japan requires products treated with them to be labeled at the point of sale with a list of fungicides used. This requirement does not have a significant impact on domestic producers because Japanese farmers selling their produce domestically do not need to treat that produce for long-distance distribution and generally apply fungicides prior to harvest. The requirement may disadvantage U.S. products, because it inaccurately implies that competing Japanese products have not been treated with fungicides. Maximum Residue Limits Japan’s procedures for enforcement of maximum residue limits (MRLs) result in uncertainty for shippers, including those who have never violated Japan’s standards. Following an MRL violation by one exporter, Japan imposes enhanced surveillance on all imports of that product from the exporting country. If a second violation is detected during the enhanced surveillance period, Japan will detain and test all shipments of that product from the exporting country, holding shipments until residue testing proves compliance. A violation by a single producer from one country does not establish a systemic problem in that country and does not justify taking country-wide measures in response. The United States continues to urge Japan to adopt a risk-based approach to addressing MRL violations, and apply enhanced measures to all shipments from a particular country only when evidence indicates a systemic, country-wide problem. Beef and Beef Products On May 17, 2019, Japan eliminated age-related restrictions on the cattle from which U.S. beef and beef product exports to Japan are derived, thereby allowing use of cattle that are 30 months of age and older. However, Japan maintained the requirement that U.S. exporters must hygienically remove those tissues Japan defines to be specified risk materials (SRMs). Japan’s definition of SRMs is more restrictive than the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) guidelines provide for countries with a negligible risk for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulations. Specifically, Japan requires that all parts of the head, other than tongues, cheek meat (Masseter muscle), and skins, be removed.

The United States continues to seek Japan’s alignment with international guidelines. Plant Health Table-Stock Potatoes U.S. potato exports to Japan are limited to chipping potatoes. In March 2020, the United States submitted an official request to Japan for market access for table-stock potatoes. In September 2023, Japan provided the final pest list for table-stock potatoes. In the September 2024 plant health bilateral meeting, Japan informed the United States that Japan is making progress on completing the pest risk assessment. The United States continues to engage with Japan on this market access request. Apples In 2017, the United States submitted an official request to export apples to Japan under a systems approach, which would provide Japan with a comparable level of phytosanitary protection to Japan’s current regulatory approach and eliminate costly pest-mitigation requirements for U.S. exporters. The United States will continue to engage with Japan and provide capacity building on the requested systems approach. Stone Fruit In August 2021, Japan granted market access for U.S.-grown Japanese plum varieties, but Japan continues to impose costly fumigation requirements. On May 13, 2024, Japan approved five additional plum varieties for import into Japan. The United States will continue to engage with Japan on phytosanitary topics related to U.S. stone fruit, including the U.S. market access request for peaches and revision of the fumigation monitoring requirements for U.S. plums. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Japan is a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). Japan is obligated to open its GPA-covered government procurement tenders to goods, services, and suppliers from the United States and other GPA Parties. U.S. companies in several sectors have expressed concern that the Japanese Government sometimes uses technical specifications that could exclude U.S. products and services and, in some cases, may exert pressure on various entities to select domestic companies for procurement opportunities. The United States has expressed these concerns to Japan as they have arisen and will continue to engage with Japan to address these concerns. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Japan generally provides strong intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, although a number of concerns remain. Japanese and foreign products are eligible for geographical indications (GIs) protection in Japan. Japan also has recognized numerous GIs pursuant to international agreements. Exchanges of lists of terms pursuant to international agreements have resulted in Japan granting automatic GI protection to certain terms without sufficient transparency or due process. The United States continues to monitor the implementation of Japan’s GI system, as well as the implementation of its recent agreements with the European Union and other trading partners with respect to GIs. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-241-2048.jpg) ![234 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS SERVICES BARRIERS Express Delivery The United States remains concerned by unequal conditions of competition between Japan Post Co. and international express delivery suppliers. Private U.S. express carriers are required to declare all shipments for customs clearance and calculate duties and consumption taxes based on cost. Different procedures apply to Japan Post Co., as duty assessment is based on Express Mail Service (EMS) shipment rules. Japan Post Co. is regulated by a single agency—the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), whereas private express delivery companies are subject to rules imposed by various ministries, including the Ministry of Finance; the MHLW; the MAFF; and, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT). The United States continues to urge Japan to equalize customs procedures and requirements. Financial Services Postal Insurance and Banking The United States has longstanding concerns about the negative impact of Japan Post Insurance on competition in Japan’s insurance market and continues to closely monitor the implementation of reforms. The United States continues to urge Japan not to allow Japan Post Bank and Japan Post Insurance to expand the scope of their operations before a level playing field is established. Insurance Cooperatives Insurance cooperatives hold a substantial share of the insurance business in Japan. Some insurance cooperatives are regulated by their respective agencies of jurisdiction (e.g., the MAFF or the MHLW) instead of by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), which regulates all private sector insurance and financial services companies. These separate regulatory schemes create a nontransparent regulatory environment and afford insurance cooperatives critical business, regulatory, and other advantages over their private sector competitors. The United States remains concerned about limited FSA supervisory authority over insurance cooperatives. Professional Services Educational Services Japan does not treat foreign universities’ Japanese campuses as equivalent to domestic higher education institutions for tax, scholarship, endowment, and research grant purposes. This has harmed the ability of U.S. degree-granting campuses in Japan to compete for students and faculty and deterred other U.S. universities from launching full four-year degree programs in Japan. Despite extensive consultations with authorities, U.S. universities have only been offered the potential solution of becoming “educational corporations,” a status which would subject them to regulations set by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology. Stakeholders report that they are disadvantaged whether or not they are granted “educational corporations” status. If granted the status, educational corporations are required to be “independently administered” (i.e., not subject to direct administration by the parent university in the home country), which is a particularly difficult legal and administrative hurdle to overcome, because it challenges foreign universities’ ability to offer the curriculum of their main campuses, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-242-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 235 operate with the policies and practices followed at their main campuses, conform with education accreditation requirements in their home countries, and provide access to financial aid programs. On the other hand, if foreign satellite universities are not granted “educational corporations” status, they face unfavorable tax treatment compared to Japanese universities, including having to pay Japan’s 10 percent consumption tax on their tuition, fees, dorms, and any other revenue, and corporate income tax on profits at the statutory rate over 45 percent. Additionally, they are excluded from participation in Japanese Government grant programs that promote international exchange and provide financial support for study abroad, and their faculties are excluded from applying for government-funded and other research grants on the same basis as faculty at other Japanese universities. Legal Services In 2020, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) introduced protections for certain attorney-client communications, a departure from Japan’s general absence of such protections. However, the scope of protected confidential attorney–client communications is extremely limited, protecting only legal advice under the Antimonopoly Act regarding alleged antitrust cartels, which involve price-fixing, market allocation, and bid rigging. In principle, only an external lawyer’s advice to a client is protected. An in- house lawyer’s advice might be protected only if the in-house lawyer is working independently from the enterprise itself. In addition, only legal advice by lawyers qualified in Japan is protected. Legal advice from foreign lawyers (even if they are registered in Japan as a Registered Foreign Lawyer) is not protected. The rules further protect communications only for documents that are carefully segregated from other unprotected documents. The United States will continue to monitor developments and support fuller recognition of attorney-client privilege by the JFTC. Telecommunications Services Telecommunications Business Act U.S. and foreign services operators in Japan, including those offering only streaming and cloud-based services, became subject to regulation under Japan’s Telecommunications Business Act (TBA) in April 2021. Businesses that undertake intermediate communications with users in Japan, including providers of cross-border services, must register as telecommunications providers with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), appoint a representative or agent physically domiciled in Japan, and comply with regulations imposed on domestic operators under the TBA, including disclosure and reporting obligations. Spectrum Auctions Unlike most advanced economies, Japan does not use auctions to allocate spectrum for commercial mobile services. Stakeholders have raised concerns that allocation decisions under the current system are not objective and transparent. On August 30, 2024, the MIC released a report from an advisory council on the use of a “conditional auction” mechanism for the allocation of underutilized millimeter wave bands or frequency bands that need to be shared with other wireless systems. Renewable Energy Renewable energy growth in some regions of Japan has been constrained by lack of electricity grid capacity. Laws implemented in 2020 require the legal unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from the power generation and retail business, but incumbent utility companies still own and operate most of the transmission and distribution grids in Japan through wholly owned subsidiaries. These utility companies reportedly overstate actual grid usage and understate available capacity to prevent competition from new ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-243-2048.jpg) ![236 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS entrants. Many of the utility companies are also holding unused space on the grid for long-idled nuclear power reactors. Incumbent transmission utilities are required to allow power producers to connect to their power facilities unless they have a justifiable reason to deny the request. Given real grid capacity constraints in some regions, utilities have begun offering renewable generation “non-firm” transmission contracts, which allow generators to connect to the grid and use available grid capacity in exchange for a higher risk of curtailment during times of congestion. In order to ensure that renewable energy is used to the fullest extent possible, METI is considering changes to the curtailment order that would favor renewable energy generation. Industrial Storage Batteries On June 28, 2024, METI announced a new requirement for battery manufacturers to have a waste-disposal certification in order for their products to be eligible to participate in a METI-administered auction to supply storage batteries across Japan. Only Japanese companies held this certification as of December 31, 2024. Due to the length of the standard application process for the certification, this requirement created a de facto ban on all U.S. and other foreign companies from participating in the 2025 auction. Several factors in the implementation of this requirement, such as the questionable relevance of the certification for the storage battery industry and the timing of a Japanese company’s application for the certification before the official METI announcement of the new requirement, have raised significant concerns that the intent of the change was to drive business towards specific Japanese companies that would otherwise be less competitive. Although U.S. companies based in Japan have voiced concerns, made good faith efforts to apply for the certification, and provided possible resolutions to METI, no substantial changes have been made, and METI has kept the certification requirement in place. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Digital Platform Regulation In 2019, the Digital Market Competition Headquarters (DMCH), was created under the Cabinet Secretariat to lead the coordination of competition policy in the digital market. U.S. companies have expressed concern that they are being subjected to additional regulations and scrutiny that do not apply to most Japanese conglomerates, some of which operate in similar sectors. In December 2019, the JFTC released guidelines on applying the Antimonopoly Act (AMA) to transactions between digital platform operators and consumers. In these guidelines, the JFTC asserts that platform companies are in “a superior bargaining position” when customers have no choice but to provide their data to use the services and platform companies may commit an abuse of that position when use of personal data is not fully and accurately disclosed or personal data is not protected. After receiving input from stakeholders concerned about insufficient guidance, the JFTC provided several examples of practices that would or would not constitute an abuse of superior bargaining position. The Act on Improving Transparency and Fairness of Digital Platforms (the Digital Platform Act) imposes additional obligations on large companies designated by METI as “specified digital platform providers” for specific services, including “general online shopping malls selling goods,” “application stores,” “media- integrated digital ad platforms,” and “ad intermediary digital platforms.” The “specified digital platform providers” designated by METI have disproportionately captured U.S. firms compared to their Japanese and third country competitors and therefore undermine U.S. competitiveness in Japan by increasing the compliance costs on certain U.S. firms while not placing a similar burden on their competitors. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-244-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 237 SUBSIDIES Wood Products Japan maintains numerous support programs at the national, prefectural, and municipal levels that may favor domestic logs and wood products over imports. To increase the supply of domestic wood products from 34 million cubic meters in 2021 to 42 million cubic meters in 2030, Japan allocated ¥45.8 billion (approximately $303 million) for the Comprehensive Measures to Strengthen the International Competitiveness of the Forestry and Timber Industry program from the 2023 MAFF supplemental budget. Furthermore, in 2024 Japan allocated ¥173 billion (approximately $1.14 billion) under the Forest Management Project to support domestic thinning and selective logging operations. In addition, Japan has provided funding for local governments to manage unprofitable forestlands. Starting from 2024, Japan began collecting the Forest Environment Tax from each Japanese taxpayer to cover the cost of this program (approximately ¥60 billion, or $410 million, per year). The United States is monitoring the disbursement of these funds and other support programs. OTHER BARRIERS Transparency Advisory Groups Advisory councils and other government-commissioned study groups enjoy significant power in Japan’s regulatory process that sometimes goes beyond providing advice and recommendations. The United States continues to urge Japan to follow good regulatory practices and ensure transparency with respect to the formation and operation of advisory councils by adopting new requirements to ensure ample and meaningful opportunities for those not on advisory councils and study groups to participate in, and directly provide input to, the regulatory process. Public Comment Procedure The United States remains concerned about inadequate implementation of public comment procedures by Japanese ministries and agencies. In 2024, stakeholders flagged several instances where comment periods for regulations or guidelines were non-existent, unnecessarily short, or occurred at the same time as major national holidays. In other cases, comments did not appear to have been adequately considered given the brief time between the end of the comment period and the issuance of a final rule or policy. While the United States acknowledges recent instances when Japanese ministries allowed comments to be submitted in English and provided an appropriate amount of time for parties to draft, finalize, and submit their comments, for example METI’s Draft Guidelines for Corporate Takeovers, the United States stresses the need for Japan to improve the system, such as by lengthening the standard public comment period for rulemaking, more broadly and consistently. Automotive The United States has expressed strong concerns with the overall lack of access to Japan’s automotive market for U.S. automotive companies. A variety of non-tariff barriers impede access to Japan’s automotive market, and overall sales of U.S.-made vehicles and automotive parts in Japan remain low. Non-tariff barriers include the non-acceptance of U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards certification as providing an equivalent level of protection as the Japanese vehicle safety standards; unique standards and testing protocols; unique spectrum allocation for short-range vehicle communications systems; a lack ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-245-2048.jpg) ![238 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS of opportunities for input by interested persons throughout the process of developing regulations; and hindrances to the development of distribution and service networks. Japan aims to transition to 100 percent clean energy vehicles, including electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), sold in Japan by 2035. Japan provides a purchase subsidy of up to ¥850,000 (approximately $5,614) for traditional battery electric vehicles (BEVs). However, FCEVs, which are primarily produced by Japanese companies, receive a much higher subsidy than BEVs, of up to ¥2.55 million (approximately $16,843), depending on the vehicle model. Japan also restructured its system of subsidies for consumer purchases of BEVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and FCEVs. Previously, nearly all cars received similar subsidies. Under the old system, BEVs received ¥650,000 (approximately $4,293), PHEVs ¥450,000 (approximately $2,972), and FCEVs ¥2,300,000 (approximately $15,192). Now, for BEVs, the subsidy will range from ¥120,000 (approximately $793) to ¥850,000 (approximately $5,614), with primarily Japanese manufacturers benefiting the most. Japan also provides subsidies for vehicle charging stations but requires compliance with CHAdeMO, a charging standard originally developed in Japan and supported by Japanese industry groups. Although this standard was previously used in earlier model electric vehicles in other countries, Japanese automakers in 2023 joined U.S. and European automakers in endorsing other standards for their sales in North America, Europe, and China. This leaves Japan as an outlier on charging technology and disincentivizes foreign automakers and charging suppliers from operating in Japan by requiring outdated technology in order to receive the subsidy. In February 2025, Japan amended the Radio Act Enforcement Regulation to allow the use of 433.92MHz radio frequency for Short Range Vehicle Communication Systems, which includes remote keyless entry and tire-pressure monitoring systems. Japan’s shift to 433.92MHz frequency is a significant step towards global alignment. Prior to this change, Japan’s deviation from the globally recognized 433.92MHz frequency necessitated costly alterations for foreign automotive manufacturers including American automakers, and had been a longstanding non-tariff barrier. U.S. companies have noted that while transitioning to the 433.92MHz frequency, devices used in key fobs must first obtain certification meeting technical standards Japan has set from either domestic or overseas certification bodies; the United States will continue to monitor the situation to ensure these certifications are recognized in a timely manner. In addition, industry has expressed concern with differential treatment for U.S. EV charging infrastructure compared to Japanese EV charging infrastructure. The MLIT permits Japanese companies to build superchargers at highway rest areas that do not require vehicles to exit and reenter the toll highway. In contrast, vehicles are required to pay tolls to exit and reenter toll highways to access EV charging infrastructure produced by U.S. companies. MLIT has claimed since 2023 to be implementing an initiative that will allow EV owners seeking to charge their vehicles a two-hour window to exit and reenter the highway toll-free. However, as of December 31, 2024, MLIT had created only one entry and exit point for toll-free access to off-highway U.S. superchargers located in a remote area in Gifu prefecture. Stakeholders report that MLIT has made no other progress on the initiative, despite advocacy by Japan’s Fair Trade Commission in favor of the initiative. Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals Japan’s Price Maintenance Premium (PMP) system, introduced in 2010, adds price premiums to innovative new drugs and protects this price throughout the patent life of a medicine. In the 2018 pricing cycle, Japan made changes to its PMP rules that significantly reduced the number of innovative products and companies that received the full benefit of the PMP. In particular, several of the criteria that were used in PMP ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-246-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 239 calculations appeared to make it easier for Japanese companies to qualify for top premiums and were unrelated to the degree of innovation of the individual product under consideration. However, the fiscal year 2024 National Health Insurance Drug Pricing System Reform Framework that was instituted for the 2024 pricing cycle made several promising adjustments to the PMP rules. U.S. industry has also continued to raise serious concerns regarding the lack of transparency and predictability in government decision-making. For example, stakeholders reported that there was no opportunity for public comment before the Government of Japan announced off-year drug price revisions for fiscal year 2025. In addition, in recent years, the MHLW has been consolidating medical device product functional categories for price determination with little explanation and little time for key stakeholders to respond. U.S. industry is concerned about the lack of more frequent and meaningful opportunities to provide input regarding Japan’s reimbursement rules, as well as other policies of critical importance to the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries. The United States continues to urge Japan to solicit and consider the input of all stakeholders, including U.S. stakeholders, when developing any measures related to reimbursement policies, and to follow transparent processes in the present and future development of any new policies and measures. The United States also continues to urge Japan to take into account relevant international standards in the development of its regulations in clinical development, multiregional clinical trials, and risk management. In November 2023, Japan announced it would relax its requirement that additional Phase I trials be performed on Japanese people before enrolling Japanese participants in international joint clinical trials, a policy that is unique to Japan. However, this local testing requirement will remain for some drugs with strong side effects (e.g., cancer treatment drugs), representing a continuing concern. Nutritional Supplements Japan regulates nutritional supplements as a part of a loosely defined “health food” subcategory of foodstuffs, unlike in the United States, where “dietary supplements” are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under different regulations than “conventional” foods. Generally, health food products in Japan are subject to more stringent regulatory oversight than general foods, which has resulted in extra hurdles for U.S. exporters regarding health claims and ingredients than can be used for nutritional supplements when trying to enter the Japanese market. Japan has taken steps to streamline import procedures and improve access in this market. Quasi-Drugs Quasi-drugs are defined in Japan’s Act on Securing the Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products Including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (PMD Act) as products with limited amounts of officially recognized active ingredients and are generally classified in the United States as over-the-counter drugs (for example, anti-acne products) or cosmetic products (for example, anti-aging products). U.S. companies indicate they are experiencing delays in market authorization due to Japan’s delay in the adoption of a well-designed online system to process requirements and updates. Although there have been some improvements in processing time, there continue to be delays in the adoption of a monograph (or product standard) system intended to expedite the registration of such products as quasi-drugs under the PMD Act. As a result, products that contain active ingredients that are approved for specific uses in Japan, such as in anti-dandruff shampoos and skin care, may require up to six months to receive market approval. The MHLW is currently working with industry and local prefectural governments to develop a monograph system (such as “Approval Product Standards for Medicated Cosmetics”), which lists the approved uses for previously reviewed ingredients and claims. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-247-2048.jpg) ![240 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS JORDAN TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Jordan Free Trade Agreement The United States–Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force on December 17, 2001. Under the FTA, as of January 1, 2010, Jordan provides duty-free access to nearly all U.S. exports, with exceptions for a few product lines, such as alcoholic beverages. The United States and Jordan meet regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the Agreement and to address outstanding issues. IMPORT POLICIES Taxes Jordan’s General Sales Tax law allows the government to impose a special tax at the time of importation in addition to the general sales tax. For example, Jordan imposes a 15 percent special tax on carbonated drinks. Jordan also imposes a special tax on vehicles that varies according to the type of engine, which in practice only affects imports as there is no domestic motor vehicle production. Cars with conventional fuel engines are taxed within a range of 67 percent to 94 percent, electric-powered cars are taxed within a range of 10 percent to 15 percent, and hybrid vehicles are taxed at 50 percent. Most U.S.-origin cars sold in Jordan are conventional fuel or hybrid. The United States continues to work with Jordan to promote transparency and predictability of taxation policies. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Licensing Import licenses are required for specific food products by the Ministry of Health and for raw agricultural goods by the Ministry of Agriculture. The approval process can be time-consuming and, at times, lacks transparency. U.S. exporters have raised concerns about the difficulty of obtaining import licenses from the Ministry of Agriculture for U.S.-origin chicken leg quarters and live dairy cattle. The United States continues to engage with Jordanian authorities to address this issue. Jordan requires that importers of commercial goods be registered traders or commercial entities. The Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Supply occasionally issues directives requiring import licenses for certain goods or categories of goods and products in newly emerging or protected sectors. Jordan requires a special import license prior to the importation of telecommunications and security equipment. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Jordan ratified the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in February 2017. Jordan has not yet submitted four transparency notifications related to: (1) import, export, and transit regulations; (2) the use of customs brokers; (3) customs contact points for the exchange of information; and (4) details on the operation of the single window. The first three notifications were due to the WTO on February 22, 2017, and notification of details on the operation of the single window was due on December 31, 2022, according to Jordan’s self-designated TFA implementation schedule. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-248-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 241 TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE Corn Import Sampling Procedures According to U.S. stakeholders, Jordan’s Ministry of Agriculture does not comply with the sampling technique guidance for grain issued by the Jordan Standards and Metrology Organization, and Jordan’s poor sampling techniques have resulted in the rejection of shipments of U.S.-origin corn. The United States has worked with Jordan to improve sampling and inspection procedures, but problems persist. As a result, U.S. exports of corn to Jordan have decreased significantly compared to 2021 and prior years. In 2023, U.S. corn exports to Jordan were valued at approximately $300,000. That year, Jordan accepted a certificate of inspection from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Federal Grain Inspection Service that has been extended through December 31, 2027. In September 2024, Jordan’s Ministry of Agriculture extended the validity of the certificate for another three years. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT In September 2022, the Jordanian Cabinet adopted Government Procurement Bylaw No. 8, which grants priority to a domestic bid over a foreign bid if the bids are equivalent in terms of requirements, specifications, and price. Additionally, Jordan offers domestic companies a preferential rate of 15 percent in all government tenders based on a 2013 cabinet decision, which has been renewed annually. Jordan is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since March 2000. In 2002, Jordan began the process of acceding to the WTO GPA with the submission of its initial offer, but negotiations on Jordan’s accession have been inactive since 2014. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Jordan continues to take steps to provide more comprehensive protection of intellectual property (IP) rights. In September 2023, Jordan’s Cyber Crime law went into effect, criminalizing a broad array of digital violations, including pirated content. However, challenges regarding IP protection and enforcement persist. As seen throughout the region, online and physical copyright infringement is widespread. For example, the National Library, the primary IP authority in Jordan, continues to express challenges to combating online and physical copyright infringement, including a lack of adequate resources and training that hinder effective enforcement. Law enforcement officials need to continue efforts to strengthen enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods, particularly with respect to using ex officio authority to pursue criminal investigations. The U.S. Government continues to engage with the Government of Jordan on these issues. INVESTMENT BARRIERS The Investment Environment Law No. (21) of 2022, which entered into force in January 2023, and the Investment Regulation Bylaw No. 7 of 2023 (the “Investment Law”) consolidated 18 investment laws into one regulation. Although Jordan is generally open to foreign investment, the Investment Law limits foreign ownership to no greater than 50 percent (subject to limited exceptions) in: retail and wholesale trading, including distribution, import services, and export services; engineering consultancy services, construction contracting and related services, brokerage services (except for financial intermediation), commercial agencies, insurance brokers, and food and beverage services; and transportation services and customs clearance services including maritime, air transport, and land transportation services. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-249-2048.jpg) ![242 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS KENYA IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs Kenya’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 13.8 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Kenya’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 24.7 percent for agricultural products and 12.0 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Kenya has bound 16.3 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 93.8 percent. Kenya applies the East African Community (EAC) Customs Union’s Common External Tariff (CET), with four tariff bands: (1) zero percent duty for raw materials and inputs, (2) 10 percent duty for processed or manufactured inputs, (3) 25 percent duty for finished products, and (4) 35 percent for a list of products the EAC concluded would promote regional integration and domestic industrial sectors. Among the imports that are impacted by the 35 percent fourth tariff band are U.S. exports of secondhand clothing and environmentally cleaner cooking products. Many textiles and agricultural products are classified as “sensitive items” under the EAC and as a result are subject to ad valorem tariff rates above 35 percent. This includes rates of 50 percent for some textiles, 60 percent for most milk products, 50 percent for corn and corn flour, 75 percent for rice flour, 50 percent for wheat flour, and 100 percent for sugar. When deemed necessary, the Kenyan Government has temporarily waived agricultural tariffs to stabilize prices when domestic agricultural prices exceeded certain levels. When the Kenyan Government has taken such action, it has applied for and regularly received from the EAC an exemption from the CET. Application of EAC-wide CET exemptions varies case-by-case. In June 30, 2020, the EAC amended its CET to exclude from import duty exemption (and thus apply duties) to products related to the development of solar and wind energy, while continuing to exempt from duties “specialized equipment for generation of solar and wind energy, photovoltaic modules, direct current charge controllers, direct current inverters, including accessories and deep cycle batteries which use and/or store solar power.” Kenya subsequently extended duties to spare parts and accessories to solar equipment later in the year. Kenya began implementing the 2020 EAC CET amendments for solar and wind energy equipment in July 2021 but has not uniformly implemented them. Some stakeholders voiced concern that the amendment to the CET does not adequately define the term “spare parts and accessories.” Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans On September 10, 2024, Kenya imposed a ban on sugar imports from outside the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the EAC in response to increased local sugar production that satisfied local consumption. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation U.S. companies have raised concerns about the length of time required for Kenyan Customs to release shipments, as well as the use of a complex and inefficient process that involves many steps with uncoordinated offices, despite implementation of a single window system.

The PVoC program requires pre-shipment inspection of most imports in their country of origin to ensure compliance with applicable Kenyan standards and regulations. Under the PVoC program, an importer must obtain a Certificate of Conformity (CoC) from a PVoC inspection agent in its region designated by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS). The PVoC inspection agent assesses what, if any, testing is required to meet Kenyan standards and regulations. Kenya asserts that the program is necessary to address health, environmental, and security concerns, but U.S. industry has raised concerns that the program’s testing, certification, and labeling requirements deviate from international standards without providing an additional measure of safety. For U.S. food and agricultural goods, Kenya requires PVoC inspections on a consignment-by-consignment basis in the United States prior to export. As an incentive to use the PVoC program, Kenya charges higher fees for destination inspection if the product arrives without a CoC from a PVoC inspection agent. Currently, Kenya has only designated one inspection company, SGS, to perform PVoC inspections in the United States, further limiting the ability of U.S. exporters interested in selling products to Kenya. Certain products are exempt from the PVoC program, including raw materials, machines, and spare parts imported by registered local manufacturers; products certified by KEBS under the Diamond Mark of quality product certification; and products waived by the Kenyan Government through the Cabinet Secretary for Investment, Trade, and Industry. Goods exempted from the program are still subject to KEBS destination inspection. Goods arriving at the port of entry in Kenya without having undergone an inspection through the PVoC program to obtain a CoC are subject to inspection by KEBS. The cost of inspection at port is 5 percent of the customs value of the shipment, and the goods may be rejected. After obtaining a CoC or undergoing inspection at the port of entry, the importer must also purchase from KEBS an Import Standardization Mark label that must be affixed to each imported article or its retail packaging. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Agricultural Biotechnology On October 3, 2022, Kenya lifted a 10-year ban on the import and commercialization of genetically engineered (GE) products, opening a path to cultivation and import of GE food and feed. However, the lifting of the ban is on hold pending the outcome of a domestic legal challenge before Kenya’s Court of Appeals. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-251-2048.jpg) ![244 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Animal Genetics In January 2020, Kenya’s Office of the Director of Veterinary Services (DVS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service agreed on veterinary requirements and certificate attestations for the importation of bovine embryos from the United States. In May 2020, however, the DVS proposed additional requirements that went beyond those previously agreed by the two agencies. Kenya imposes standards that are overly restrictive for bovine semen imports, precluding actual market access for most U.S. bovine semen for dairy cattle and leaving the largest share of the market to the domestic producers who do not meet the same criteria. Import Permits Kenya maintains complex, nontransparent, and costly requirements for the importation of all meat, dairy, and poultry products, including a “Letter of No Objection to Import Permit” (no-objection letter) issued by DVS. Before issuing a no-objection letter, which requires several attestations, including animal and public health statements, DVS requires an importer to explain the reason for importation through a “Letter of Application to Import” and to specifically address the market need the import would meet. DVS issues the no-objection letter for meat, dairy, and poultry products at its discretion on a case-by-case basis. Importers have reported that DVS has at times provided them with non-sanitary-related grounds for denying permits, such as the local availability of a similar product. DVS and other competent authorities do not always provide written justification for not issuing the letter. Plants and Plant Products Kenya subjects imported and domestically produced corn to a total aflatoxin limit of 10 parts per billion (ppb) and a 13.5 percent maximum moisture content. The aflatoxin limit in Kenya is lower than the standard adopted by the Codex Alimentarius and the U.S. action level for aflatoxin, and Kenya has not provided adequate scientific justification for these requirements. As a result, most U.S. exports are denied import permits. Under special circumstances – such as food shortages – Kenya has allowed higher moisture content for imported corn, which must then be dried and milled immediately upon arrival to reduce the risk of aflatoxin contamination. For U.S. corn exports that are permitted under special circumstances, the costs associated with the additional processing requirements make U.S. corn exports largely uncompetitive. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Since May 2015, an initiative dubbed “Buy Kenya Build Kenya” has required government institutions to procure at least 40 percent of their supplies locally. For example, government entities are required to give an exclusive procurement preference to motor vehicles and motorcycles produced by companies that have assembly plants in Kenya. Procurement preferences are given to companies that have assembly plants in Kenya (even if the specific item procured is not assembled or manufactured in Kenya). The 2016 Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act (PPADA) reserves procurement preferences for Kenyan-owned firms and goods manufactured or mined in Kenya. For tenders funded entirely by the government with a value of less than Kenya Shillings 50 million (approximately $388,000), the preference for Kenyan firms and goods is required. If the procuring entity seeks to contract with non-Kenyan firms or procure foreign goods, the PPADA requires a report detailing evidence of an inability to procure locally. In April 2020, the National Treasury issued implementing regulations for the PPADA, which mandate that tender proposals include offset requirements such as skills and knowledge transfer to Kenyan citizens, a 75 percent set-aside of employment opportunities for Kenyans, and a local content plan. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-252-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 245 U.S. firms have had limited success bidding on Kenyan Government tenders. Corruption often influences the outcome of public tenders, and many of these tenders are challenged in the courts. Tenders are often not announced in a timely and transparent manner. Foreign firms, some without proven track records, have won government contracts when partnered with well-connected Kenyan firms or individuals. The Kenyan government mandates that all tenders and procurements are required to be undertaken through the Kenyan Government’s electronic procurement system, the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). Concerns about IFMIS include insufficient connectivity and technical capacity in county government offices, central control shutdowns, and security gaps that render the system vulnerable to manipulation and hacking. Kenya is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Kenya’s mandatory (yet currently unenforced) customs recordation system and Import Permit application requirement, both administered by the Anti-Counterfeit Authority, add additional costs and resources for U.S. stakeholders bringing products containing intellectual property into Kenya. Widespread availability of counterfeit and pirated goods remains an issue. Stakeholders also have raised concerns regarding the distribution of copyright-infringing content online and the need for Kenya to join the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Internet Treaties, which deal particularly with copyright and related rights in the digital environment. Kenya signed the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty in 1996 but has yet to ratify it. SERVICES BARRIERS Insurance Services Kenya requires that a minimum of one-third of the equity of an insurance company be held by Kenyan persons or citizens of another EAC Member State. In addition, Kenya requires that local insurers offer at least 20 percent of their treaty reinsurance contracts to the state-owned Kenya Reinsurance Corporation (Kenya Re). Although regulatory approval can be sought, Kenya generally prohibits cross-border Difference-in-Conditions and Difference-in-Limits insurance, which is an important type of insurance for facilitating U.S. investment in countries such as Kenya because it covers unique risks faced by U.S. firms. Kenya requires goods imported to the country through sea or air to be covered by marine cargo insurance sourced from the local insurance industry. Telecommunications Services On August 22, 2023, Kenya repealed the 30 percent local equity requirements for non-Kenyan information and communications technology companies operating in Kenya. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS On December 27, 2024, Kenya replaced its digital services tax with a “significant economic presence tax” under the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act of 2024. A three percent effective tax rate on gross revenues is imposed on non-residents whose revenue from the provision of services is derived from or accrues in Kenya through a digital marketplace. Those excepted from the application of the tax include non-residents who offer services through a permanent establishment in Kenya or have an annual turnover of less than 5 million Kenyan Shillings (approximately $38,800). ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-253-2048.jpg) ![246 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Data Localization Requirements Kenya’s 2019 Data Protection Act (DPA) includes unclear provisions governing the cross-border transfer of personal information. The DPA requires that either data subjects provide consent for transfers outside Kenya or controllers provide proof that personal data will be secure as a condition for transferring the data outside Kenya, but does not describe what would constitute acceptable proof. The 2021 Data Protection regulations require companies processing personal data “for the purpose of actualizing a public good” to be processed in a data center located and maintain in Kenya at least one copy of the personal data used. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Limitations on Foreign Equity Participation Kenya imposes foreign ownership limitations in certain sectors. For example, the 2016 Private Security Regulation Act restricts foreign participation in the private security sector by requiring at least 25 percent Kenyan ownership of private security firms. The 2016 Mining Act imposes a variety of restrictions on foreign participation in the mining sector. Among other restrictions, the Mining Act reserves acquisition of mineral rights for Kenyan companies, requires 60 percent Kenyan ownership of both mineral dealerships and artisanal mining companies, and requires large- scale mining operations to list a minimum of 20 percent of their shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange within three years of commencing operations, while also offering 10 percent “free-carried interest” (free equity stake) to the Kenyan Government. On August 22, 2023, Kenya lifted the 30 percent domestic ownership requirements in the Information and Communications Technology sector, which stimulated new foreign investments in the sector. Real Estate Restrictions The 2010 Kenyan Constitution prohibits foreigners from holding freehold land title anywhere in the country, permitting only leasehold titles of up to 99 years. The process for leasing developed land and property is clear and established, but the process for obtaining leasehold title of undeveloped land is opaque and unreliable. For undeveloped land, investors risk receiving fake title deeds or leasing a plot with multiple titles and unauthorized sales. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES The Kenyan Government wholly owns the National Oil Corporation and the Kenya Pipeline Corporation, which limits competition in this sector. Other state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including Kenya Electricity Generating Company, Kenya Electricity Transmission Company, Kenya Power, and the Geothermal Development Company, dominate the electricity generation, transmission, and distribution segments of the energy sector. Kenya Power’s internal procurement rules require that 80 percent of supplies be sourced from Kenyan-registered companies to encourage foreign suppliers to register by establishing manufacturing facilities in the country. Certain SOEs have enjoyed preferential access to markets. Examples include Kenya Re, which enjoys a guaranteed re-insurance market share; Kenya Seed Company, which has fewer marketing barriers than its U.S. competitors; and the National Oil Corporation, which benefits from retail market outlets developed with government funds. Some SOEs have also benefited from easier access to government loan guarantees, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-254-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 247 subsidies, and credit at favorable interest rates. The Kenyan Government announced in November 2023 that it would privatize several SOEs. However, the Kenyan High Court halted the privatization of 11 SOEs in September 2024, declaring the Privatization Act unconstitutional due to lack of public participation during its enactment. OTHER BARRIERS Disputes over tariffs and taxation are resolved through the judicial system, which is subject to delays and uncertainty. Since June 2015, the Kenya Revenue Authority has offered an alternative dispute resolution mechanism to help taxpayers resolve some tax disputes more quickly. Bribery and Corruption Corruption remains a substantial barrier to doing business in Kenya. U.S. firms continue to report challenges competing against foreign firms that are willing to ignore legal standards or engage in bribery and other forms of corruption. Corruption is widely reported to affect government procurements at the national and county levels. Kenya has not effectively implemented its anticorruption laws. U.S. firms continue to report direct and indirect requests for bribes from multiple levels of the Kenyan Government. Export Ban The 2013 Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Authority Act prohibits exports of raw agricultural produce such as macadamia nuts, achiote, cashew nuts, and pyrethrum without authorization from the Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for Investment, Trade, and Industry. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-255-2048.jpg) ![248 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS KOREA TRADE AGREEMENTS United States–Korea Free Trade Agreement The United States–Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) entered into force on March 15, 2012. Korea immediately eliminated duties on nearly 80 percent of bilateral trade in industrial and consumer goods. Duties on most other such goods were phased out in stages over 10 years and have been eliminated as of January 1, 2021. Tariffs continue to be phased out for certain seafood products, which are scheduled to be eliminated in 2026. Korea has eliminated tariffs on the majority of U.S. agricultural products, while maintaining tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) on a handful of U.S. agricultural exports. The United States and Korea reached agreement in 2018 to modifications and amendments to KORUS and a related letter exchange. The United States and Korea meet regularly to review the implementation and operation of KORUS and to address outstanding issues. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Chemicals Four laws and their respective implementing regulations form the basis of Korea’s chemical management system: the Act on the Registration and Evaluation of Chemicals (last revised in April 2021); the Occupational Safety and Health Act (last revised in August 2021); the Consumer Chemical Products and Biocides Safety Control Act (last revised in May 2021); and the Chemical Substances Control Act (last revised in August 2021). U.S. chemicals exporters regularly raise concerns with aspects of all of these laws and their implementing regulations, including: lack of guidance from the regulators on how to implement the regulations; insufficient protection for confidential business information; and inadequate transparency regarding the selection of chemicals to be tested and the testing methodology. Packaging Materials and Labeling Regulations U.S. stakeholders remain concerned about the lack of clarity relating to the calculation method for packaging space ratios used by Korean Government authorities under the Act on the Promotion of Saving and Recycling of Resources (Recycling Act). While not yet passed, proposed amendments to the Recycling Act in August 2020 and November 2020 would mandate pre-launch testing of packaging materials and labeling of small electronic products to ensure compliance with specified packaging requirements. Stakeholders have raised concerns that the amendments would delay product releases, particularly when not provided with sufficient time to find alternative solutions to adapt to new requirements. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Agricultural Biotechnology Korea’s regulatory system for agricultural biotechnology continues to present challenges to U.S. agricultural exports.

The Korean Government, led by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), manages the regulatory approval process across five different agencies, each with its own process and data submission requirements. The Korean Government has indicated a willingness to continue discussing potential reforms to its regulatory process; however, the current Living Modified Organisms (LMO) Act mandates participation by all five agencies and thus limits the potential for streamlining the approval process without legislative changes. The United States and industry stakeholders have provided ideas on how to improve the process and developed pilot projects to test a streamlined process for biotechnology product reviews. These initiatives have had little impact, and Korea’s lack of reforms continue to slow global regulatory harmonization. In 2024, Korean lawmakers submitted a draft revision to the LMO Act to the National Assembly, which proposes to define products derived from genome editing technology that do not use or contain foreign genes in the final products and exempt those products from the LMO Act. The United States raised concerns with Korea’s approval process for agricultural biotechnology products and policies for products derived from genome editing during the September 24, 2024, meeting of the KORUS Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (KORUS SPS Committee). Beef and Beef Products Prior to 2008, Korea restricted the importation of U.S. beef and beef products, citing concerns related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). In 2008, the United States and Korea reached a bilateral agreement to fully reopen Korea’s market to U.S. beef and beef products. However, as a transitional measure, Korea required that U.S. beef and beef products imported into Korea be derived from animals less than 30 months of age. This “transitional measure” has remained in place for sixteen years. In addition, Korea continues to prohibit the import of processed beef products, including ground beef patties, beef jerky, and sausage, regardless of age. Market Access for Pet Food Containing Ruminant Ingredients The United States originally requested resumption of market access for pet food containing ruminant ingredients in 2006 following Korea’s ban of all ruminant products from the United States in 2003. In May 2018, the United States sent an expanded market access request to Korea’s Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) for pet food containing U.S.-origin ruminant ingredients, as well as any ruminant ingredients imported from countries that, like the United States, are deemed by the World Organization for Animal Health as having a negligible risk for BSE. MAFRA published the revised import health requirements for pet food on January 15, 2025. Horticultural Products Several U.S. market access requests remain pending with the MAFRA Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA). Among them are expanded access for blueberries from U.S. states other than Oregon; expanded access for potatoes from 11 additional U.S. states; improvement in the cherry import program; and access for apples, pears, baby carrots, strawberries, California stone fruits, and frozen raspberries and blackberries. The United States requested that the APQA expedite the approval process for these products. The United States and Korea continued efforts to establish access for U.S. exports and discussed these issues during the KORUS SPS Committee meeting on September 24, 2024 and at a bilateral plant health technical meeting in November 2024. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-257-2048.jpg) ![250 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Maximum Residue Limits Korea’s Positive List System (PLS) requires the establishment of new import tolerances for agrochemical residues that were previously permitted but not officially registered for use in Korea, as well as for new substances that do not have any maximum residue limits (MRLs) in Korea. As of January 2022, Korea requires U.S. agricultural exports to comply with Korea’s domestic MRLs, import tolerance, or a default of 0.01 parts per million (ppm). On January 1, 2024, Korea eliminated its policy of recognizing veterinary drug MRLs for the same tissue in a similar species and no longer accepts Codex Alimentarius (Codex) MRLs for veterinary drug residues in beef, pork, chicken, eggs, milk, and fishery products. Instead, Korea now implements its PLS for veterinary drugs, referencing only domestic MRLs or import tolerances (IT) set for veterinary drugs in the aforementioned products. In the absence of a domestic MRL or IT, a 0.01 ppm default tolerance applies. For growth supplements such as beta-agonist and steroid type anti-inflammatory drugs, “non-detection” applies. For products other than beef, pork, chicken, milk, eggs, and fishery products, Korea continues to accept Codex MRLs and lowest MRLs set for the same tissue in a similar species in the absence of Korea’s domestic MRLs. The United States works continuously with Korea’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to promote the establishment of science-based MRLs that align with international standards to streamline market access for imported food and agricultural products. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Korea is a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). Encryption and Security Requirements for Public Procurement of Information and Communication Technology Equipment Korea and the United States are both members of the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA), under which products certified at any CCRA-accredited laboratory in any member country should be accepted as meeting the certification requirements in any other member country. However, Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) has imposed additional domestic cybersecurity certification requirements through its Security Evaluation Scheme (SES) since October 2014. Korea has broadly imposed the SES for Common Criteria (CC)-certified information technology products to be sold to the public sector. In October 2022, the NIS introduced a three-tiered scheme dividing all public institutions into three sensitivity tiers. The NIS now allows institutions in the middle and lower tiers, such as universities and public schools, to use CC-certified information and communication technology products without additional domestic security verification. However, the SES still applies to most major public institutions, which account for over 90 percent of the public sector market, including all central administrative institutions such as ministries and metropolitan local governments. The United States has urged Korea to abide by its obligations as a CCRA member. Korea requires network equipment procured by public sector agencies (i.e., government agencies and quasi- government agencies) to incorporate encryption functionality certified by the NIS. However, the NIS only certifies encryption modules based on the Korean-developed ARIA and SEED encryption algorithms, rather than the internationally standardized Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in widespread use worldwide. Although ARIA and SEED are aligned with ISO standards, they are primarily used in Korea. This restriction has de facto significantly limited U.S. suppliers’ access to this market as it requires the development of a Korea-specific product line, which may not be commercially viable. The United States ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-258-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 251 has urged Korea to ensure that equipment based on widely used standards has full access to Korea’s public sector market. In September 2024, the NIS announced it will also recognize AES and introduce a Multi- Level Security (MLS) scheme in 2025. Cloud Security Certification for Public Sector Cloud Service Procurement The Cloud Security Assurance Program (CSAP) was created by the Korea Internet and Security Agency in 2016 and elevated from administrative guidance to a legal requirement through a March 2022 revision to the Cloud Computing Promotion Act. The CSAP, which applies to Korea’s central, provincial, and local public sector with very limited exceptions, creates significant barriers to foreign cloud service providers (CSPs) seeking to sell to Korea’s public sector. CSPs are required to create physically segregated facilities for exclusive use by government-owned customers, comply with data localization of cloud systems, create backup systems and data, and ensure that operations and management personnel of cloud service providers are located within the territory of Korea to obtain the low-tier certification. CSPs must also use only NIS- certified encryption algorithms (ARIA or SEED). The potential market from which U.S. providers are being excluded is large and growing. In August 2022, Korea began a review of the CSAP with a view to reform it in a way that would open market access possibilities for foreign service providers, indicating it would benchmark the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). On January 19, 2023, Korea revised the Notification of the Security Certification for Cloud Computing Services to introduce a three-tiered scheme dividing all public networks into three risk tiers under the CSAP, which still creates significant barriers to U.S. CSPs seeking to sell to Korea’s public sector. Only those CSPs that have at least the mid-tier CSAP certification can effectively participate in the government’s digital transformation initiative. The United States raised this issue on May 16, 2024 and urged Korea to align its cloud security certification requirements with other internationally accepted standards. In September 2024, NIS announced it will waive the local encryption algorithm requirement up to the mid-tier CSAP certification. Offsets in Defense Procurement The Korean Government has pursued policies that prioritize local technology and products over foreign defense technology through its defense offset program. An offset obligation may arise for a foreign contractor should the value of the defense contract exceed $10 million. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION In general, Korea has a strong regime of intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement. Under KORUS, Korea agreed to strong enforcement provisions for various types of IP rights and agreed to join key multilateral IP agreements. Moreover, the Korean Government prioritizes IP protection, as Korea is a significant creator of IP. Nevertheless, some IP-related concerns remain, including with respect to: the transshipment of counterfeit goods, especially via small express-shipped parcels; geographical indications; and a lack of civil and criminal penalties sufficient to deter IP violations. The United States continues to work with Korea to improve these areas.

Insurance Services Reinsurance firms are not able to transfer information outside Korea as required in their ordinary course of business and as provided under KORUS. Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) informed the U.S. Government in 2022 and in 2024 that it changed its interpretation of relevant rules under the Personal Information Protection Act such that U.S. reinsurance companies can send personal information of primary insurance policy holders outside Korea for purposes of data processing, risk management, and underwriting. In a September 23, 2024 KORUS Financial Services Committee meeting, progress was made in clarifying important outstanding questions around the use of a revised consent form and changes to Korean law. However, there is no public written documentation of this upon which industry could rely for legal certainty, and U.S. reinsurance companies continued to report in 2024 that they have not been able to send information cross-border in the absence of such certainty. Professional Services Since 2013, Korea has taken steps to open its legal services market, as outlined in KORUS. The amended Foreign Legal Consultants Act now allows foreign law firms to open foreign legal consultant offices in Korea and to enter into “cooperative agreements” with Korean firms to handle cases jointly where domestic and foreign legal issues are mixed. Foreign-licensed lawyers and firms have been able to establish joint ventures and hire Korean-licensed lawyers since 2017, but several requirements discourage U.S. companies from doing so. The Act limits a foreign law firm’s ownership of the joint venture to 49 percent and requires that the firms composing the joint venture have been in operation for at least three years in the home jurisdiction. The Act also requires foreign and Korean law firms participating in a joint venture to establish a new separate legal entity under Korean law. In addition, the Act limits the scope of practice of joint ventures. These provisions undermine the legislation’s purpose of facilitating trade in legal services between the two countries. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Network Usage Fees Since 2021, a number of bills have been introduced in the National Assembly that would require foreign content providers to pay network usage fees to Korean Internet service providers (ISPs). Because some Korean ISPs are also themselves content providers, fees paid by U.S. content providers could benefit a Korean competitor. Furthermore, such a mandate could be anticompetitive by further strengthening Korea’s ISP oligopoly of three major providers to the detriment of the content industry. The United States raised this issue with Korea on several occasions throughout 2024. Competition Policy In 2024, the Korean Government, including the Korea Free Trade Commission and the National Assembly, considered proposals to regulate certain suppliers of digital services that meet global and national revenue thresholds. These proposals would apply to a number of large U.S. companies operating in the Korean market. The proposals also appear to apply to two large Korean companies, but exclude a number of other major Korean companies as well as companies from other countries. The proposals include a number of ex ante prohibitions and obligations that would apply to companies to address competition issues in the Korean market.

The United States continues to urge Korea to improve its engagement with this sector by enhancing transparency and providing meaningful opportunities for stakeholder input. Location-Based Data Korea’s restrictions on the export of location-based data have led to a competitive disadvantage for international suppliers seeking to incorporate such data into services offered from outside Korea. For example, foreign-based suppliers of interactive services incorporating location-based functions, such as traffic updates and navigation directions, cannot fully compete against Korean companies because locally- based competitors typically are not dependent on foreign data processing centers and do not need to export location-based data. Korea is the only significant market in the world that maintains such restrictions on the export of location-based data. While there is no general legal prohibition on exporting location-based data, exporting such data requires a license. As of December 31, 2024, Korea had never approved a license to export cartographic or other location-based data, despite receiving numerous applications from foreign suppliers. Data Localization The 2011 Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) imposes restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside Korea. In 2023, the PIPA was substantially revised, and the Korean Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) adopted an Enforcement Decree that took effect in March 2024. These changes provide the PIPC with new authority to impose fines on service providers based on their global revenue rather than revenue in Korea, and to order the suspension of cross-border transfer of personal data. The PIPA permits the transfer of personal data outside of Korea only in limited circumstances, such as when the service provider has obtained a separate consent from the data subject to transfer data outside of Korea, when the recipient of the data has obtained a privacy certification recognized by the PIPC, or when the data is transferred to a country that the PIPC has determined provides an equal level of data protection, among others. These restrictions pose barriers to the cross-border provision of based services that depend on data storage and processing. National Core Technology Barriers to Using U.S. CSPs Under the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology (Industrial Technology Protection Act), MOTIE maintains a list of national core technologies that, if leaked overseas, could adversely affect national security. This includes technologies in the semiconductor, automotive, robotics, and aircraft sectors. MOTIE does not allow the use of foreign CSPs for national core technology workloads, claiming that U.S. CSPs may export data overseas. U.S. stakeholders have been working with MOTIE on new guidelines for using cloud computing for companies working on national core technologies and urged MOTIE to release the guidelines as soon as possible. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Korea maintains various restrictions on foreign investment in the telecommunications and broadcast media sectors. Korean law prohibits foreign investment in radio and terrestrial broadcasting operations; limits foreign ownership to no greater than 25 percent in news agency activities; and limits foreign ownership to no greater than 49 percent in television programming and content distribution, cable and satellite broadcasting services, and wired, wireless, satellite, and other telecommunications.

Korea also limits foreign ownership to no greater than 50 percent for enterprises engaged in raising beef cattle; meat wholesaling; electric power sale, transmission, and distribution; coastal passenger and freight transport; domestic and small air transport; and newspapers, magazines, and periodicals. OTHER BARRIERS Motor Vehicles Increased access to Korea’s automotive market for U.S. automakers remains a key priority for the United States. The U.S. Government has raised concerns about Korea’s emission-related components (ERC) regulations under Korea’s Clean Air Conservation Act. Vehicle manufacturers and importers are required to obtain either a modification certification (for a substantial modification of ERCs) or prepare modification reports for insignificant changes. However, the automobile industry has expressed concern about lack of clarity over what types of modifications fall under which category. Automakers also have noted that violations with respect to imports could be subject to criminal prosecution by Korea’s customs authorities, which lack authority to investigate domestically manufactured vehicles. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices The U.S. pharmaceutical and medical device industries continue to report concerns regarding a lack of transparency in Korea’s pricing and reimbursement policies and a lack of substantive opportunities for stakeholder input into proposed policy changes. Industry has raised similar transparency concerns regarding Korea’s Innovative Pharmaceutical Company (IPC) Accreditation policy, under which the Ministry of Health and Welfare designates certain companies as IPCs that can receive tax credits, research and development support, and more favorable premiums, but does not offer an explanation to companies that are denied the accreditation. The United States continues to urge Korea to improve its engagement with this sector by enhancing transparency and providing meaningful opportunities for stakeholder input. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-262-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 255 LAOS TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Laos Trade and Investment Framework Agreement The United States and Laos signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) on February 17, 2016. The Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Laos. The United States signed a bilateral trade agreement with Laos which entered into force on February 4, 2005. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs Laos’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 8.6 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Laos’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 11.2 percent for agricultural products and 8.1 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Laos has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound MFN tariff rate of 19.2 percent, as all of its WTO accession commitments came into force in 2023. Taxes On October 9, 2023, a Laos presidential decree raised excise taxes on six categories of products including gasoline vehicles, with progressively higher tax rates aligned with engine size, such that vehicles with engines over 5,000 cubic centimeters would be subject to a tax rate of 220 percent. U.S. automobile brands dominate the market for larger engines. Stakeholders have raised concerns that the decree was issued without adequate consultation. Non-Tariff Barriers Foreign Currency from Exports On May 2, 2024, the Bank of the Lao (BOL) imposed Decision No. 333 establishing minimum requirements and a strict timeline for converting income received in foreign currency into national currency. Exporters are required to exchange a minimum percentage of payments received in foreign currency from the export of goods and services through their import-export bank account within a specific timeframe. Both the percentage of income and the timeline vary by sector. Commercial banks are required to then sell at least 30 percent of the foreign currency they buy from export operators to the BOL by the following working day. Stakeholders have raised concerns that the decree was issued without adequate consultation. Import Bans On August 6, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Laos imposed a temporary halt on the importation of light motor vehicles including SUVs, sedans, vans, and pickup trucks with a CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) valued at over $50,000. Light motor vehicles worth more than $50,000 imported for essential work or related to international obligations, such as those for use by the government, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-263-2048.jpg) ![256 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS embassies, or international organizations, are allowed with government approval. According to the Lao Government, “the temporary suspension will be effective from August 20 to December 31, 2024, or until further notice.” Stakeholders have raised concerns regarding the ban and that the decree was issued without adequate consultation. Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Laos notified its customs valuation legislation to the WTO in July 2013, but has not yet responded to the WTO Checklist of Issues that describes how the Customs Valuation Agreement is being implemented. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE Vehicles Laos’s Government Decree No. 470 of 2019 on the management of land vehicles requires that imported vehicles, registered and used in Laos, meet regional and international standards and are in accordance with the international obligations of Laos. Under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Mutual Recognition Agreement on Type Approval for Automotive Products, the ASEAN members established a procedure for accepting or recognizing conformity assessment results with reference to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) 1958 Agreement regulations. Further regulations are anticipated, and the United States will continue to monitor the development of proposed regulations in 2025 to promote acceptance of imported vehicles that meet the high standards contained in the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Laos continues to improve its intellectual property (IP) regime, including by amending the Law on Intellectual Property to enhance IP protection in the country, which entered into force on January 24, 2024; and also continues to increase public awareness and media coverage of the harm caused by counterfeit goods and the impact of copyright piracy on local content industries. With U.S. Government assistance, Laos continues to work to establish an effective system for civil and criminal enforcement of IP. However, counterfeit and pirated goods continue to be available in Lao marketplaces. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-264-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 257 MALAYSIA TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Malaysia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement The United States and Malaysia signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement on May 10, 2004. This Agreement is the primary mechanism for discussions of trade and investment issues between the United States and Malaysia. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs Malaysia’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 5.6 percent in 2023 (latest data available). Malaysia’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 7.4 percent for agricultural products and 5.3 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Malaysia has bound 83.8 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 21.1 percent. Malaysia’s maximum WTO bound tariff rate varies significantly by product group, for example, from 5 percent for petroleum to 251 percent for dairy products. Duties for tariff lines where there is significant local production are often higher. In general, tariffs are lower for raw materials than for value-added goods. Taxes Malaysia continues to assess a higher excise tax on imported distilled spirits than on spirits that are predominantly produced domestically. Malaysia maintains very high excise taxes on motor vehicles, ranging from 60 percent to 105 percent, based on vehicle type and engine size. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Restrictions on Motor Vehicles Malaysia imposes import restrictions on automobiles under the Malaysian National Automotive Policy, which makes a fundamental distinction between “national” cars (e.g., domestic automakers Proton and Perodua) and “non-national” cars, which include other vehicles produced or assembled in Malaysia, as well as imports. The Malaysian system of “national approved permits” confers on permit holders the right to import and distribute cars and motorcycles. The national approved permits system is administered in a non- transparent manner and is used to implement a cap on the total number of vehicles that can be imported each year, currently set at 10 percent of the domestic market. In addition, Malaysia applies high tariffs in the automobile sector and has traffic restrictions and noise standards that affect the usage of large motorcycles. In its 2024 federal budget, the Malaysian Government proposed import and excise duty exemptions for imported electric vehicles (EVs) through December 31, 2025, and through December 31, 2027, for locally assembled EVs. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-265-2048.jpg) ![258 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Halal Import Requirements Malaysia requires that all imported meat (besides pork) and animal-based products, including dairy products, obtain halal certification from an approved Foreign Halal Certification Body (FHCB) as a condition of entry. Additionally, Malaysia’s halal requirements are more prescriptive than relevant international practices. Specifically, Malaysia requires slaughter plants to maintain dedicated halal production facilities and to ensure segregated storage and transportation facilities for halal and non-halal products. In contrast, relevant international practices allow for halal food to be prepared, processed, transported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that Islamic cleaning procedures have been observed. U.S. industry has expressed concerns regarding the costs of creating new, segregated production facilities to access Malaysia’s market. Additionally, the halal practices at each individual U.S. meat and poultry plant must be inspected by Malaysia’s Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM) and certified by a JAKIM-accredited FHCB before the plant can export to Malaysia. Malaysia’s Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), in conjunction with JAKIM, previously approved one U.S. beef plant and one U.S. turkey plant to export halal products to Malaysia. In October 2023, Malaysia unexpectedly suspended imports from the sole approved U.S. beef plant following an audit by DVS and JAKIM due to alleged halal concerns. JAKIM did not accept input or corrective actions from the plant. The United States is working to improve communication and engagement on halal issues with the Malaysian Government. Facility Registration Requirements In addition to halal certification requirements, Malaysia requires that all meat, poultry, and dairy facilities that export to the country be registered by DVS. This process requires submission of an application with extensive supporting documentation for DVS review, which can take several months. Following the application review, meat and poultry products are subject to plant-by-plant on-site inspection by DVS and JAKIM. For all products subject to registration, DVS requires additional documentation to make any adjustment to registration parameters (e.g., introduction of a new product in an approved plant and clerical changes to plant numbers or addresses). Updating the registration can involve additional delays of weeks to months. U.S. industry reports that the registration system is overly burdensome, creates significant delays, and is unnecessary in light of the United States’ long history of supplying safe animal products to Malaysia. Additionally, facilities that successfully complete the registration process with DVS continue to face challenges as a result of the extensive process. Minor differences between export certificate and facility details in the registration system can result in detained shipments that often take several days to weeks to clarify. Restrictive Regulations on Alcoholic Beverages Malaysia’s Food Regulations of 1985 narrowly defines alcoholic beverages in a manner that does not provide for the sale of new products that do not fit neatly within certain defined product categories. As a result, Malaysia prohibits the importation of products that do not meet these defined categories. The United States is concerned that U.S. malt-based and spirit-based ready-to-drink products are not permitted in ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-266-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 259 Malaysia, even though similar wine-based beverages are allowed. The United States continues to engage with Malaysia on its regulations for alcoholic beverage products, including its potentially trade-restricting definitions for alcoholic beverages. Live Poultry and Poultry Products In June 2022, Malaysia banned all live poultry and poultry products from the United States due to concerns about highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) proposed a regionalization arrangement, which would limit suspension of poultry trade to those areas affected by HPAI. The regionalization arrangement would also allow for resumption of trade when the outbreak is controlled. APHIS has subsequently provided additional information about its HPAI control programs at DVS’s request, but to date Malaysia has not completed internal decision making to begin discussion of a regionalization arrangement. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Malaysia generally invites international tenders only when domestic goods and services are unavailable. In those cases, foreign companies are required by law to take on a local, Bumiputera (indigenous ethnic Malay)–qualified partner before their tenders will be considered. Pharmaceutical Procurement Requirements The Malaysian Government has procurement preferences for locally manufactured pharmaceutical products, which discourage the use of imported pharmaceuticals. The Malaysian Government also provides incentives for local production. For example, the Government announced that it will grant three-year procurement contracts to companies that shift production of imported pharmaceutical products to Malaysia, with the potential for a two-year extension if those locally-produced products are exported. Malaysia is not a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement, but has been an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement since July 2012. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Malaysia has been in the process of reforming its intellectual property (IP) laws, including laws governing copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Malaysia has adopted the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 2022, which contains provisions that create a new criminal offense for committing copyright infringement with streaming. The amendment entered into force on March 18, 2022. Malaysia also continues to take steps to enhance its IP enforcement regime. However, concerns remain in several areas. Counterfeit goods are widely available, as highlighted by the continued inclusion of Petaling Street Market in Kuala Lumpur in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List). In addition, online, book, and journal piracy remain as challenges for right holders. The United States urges Malaysia to continue its efforts to improve protection against unfair commercial use, as well as unauthorized disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical products, and to enhance criminal sanctions for trade secret theft and misappropriation. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-267-2048.jpg) ![260 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS SERVICES BARRIERS Financial Services Best Interest Test Under the Financial Services Act, Bank Negara Malaysia (Malaysia’s central bank) evaluates potential investments in financial institutions based on whether the investment serves the “best interests of Malaysia,” the criteria for which include evaluating the level of Malaysian participation in the sector. Bank Negara Malaysia limits foreign ownership to a maximum of 70 percent in domestic Islamic banks, investment banks, and insurance companies, and to a maximum of 30 percent in commercial banks. Bank Negara Malaysia continues to limit foreign banks to eight physical branches in Malaysia and imposes certain other restrictions. For example, foreign banks cannot set up new branches within 1.5 kilometers of an existing local bank, and Bank Negara Malaysia considers ATMs as equivalent to separate branches. In addition, Bank Negara Malaysia has conditioned foreign banks’ ability to offer some services on commitments to undertake certain back-office activities in Malaysia. Malaysia maintains some restrictions on the business of reinsurance, requiring that Malaysian insurers first seek reinsurance from local reinsurers, and then from reinsurers based in the Labuan territory, before obtaining cross-border reinsurance. Also, primary insurers must offer Malaysian Re, the national reinsurer, up to 15 percent of certain lines of both proportional and non-proportional treaty reinsurance, and for facultative and engineering reinsurance up to a certain amount. Telecommunications Services Cabotage Policy on Undersea Cable Repairs In 2019, the Malaysian Ministry of Transport issued an exemption to the Merchant Shipping Ordinance of 1952 that allowed non-Malaysian ships to conduct submarine cable repairs in Malaysian waters. The exemption reduced the time required to conduct submarine cable repairs critical for continued Internet, voice, and data traffic. In November 2020, the new Minister of Transport revoked the exemption. On June 1, 2024, the government reinstated the exemption, though this exemption can be rescinded at any time without notice. U.S. stakeholders continue to raise concerns about the non-permanent nature of the exemption, which raises uncertainty about the timeliness of future critical submarine cable repairs. Broadcast and Screen Quota Malaysia requires that broadcast stations, through broadcast licensing agreements, devote 80 percent of terrestrial airtime to local Malaysian programming. Broadcast stations are also banned from broadcasting foreign programming during prime time. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE / DIGITAL TRADE BARRIERS Shutdowns and Other Threats to the Open Internet On September 6, 2024, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) directed Internet Service Providers in Malaysia to redirect all Domain Name System (DNS) traffic to local DNS services, which prevented anyone in Malaysia from using a non-Malaysian DNS resolver service. This directive could restrict access to information and services, disrupting commercial operations, and thereby ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-268-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 261 undermining a free and open Internet and impeding digital trade. The MCMC has suspended its directive, but it is unclear if that is a temporary or permanent action. The United States continues to monitor the situation and any impact on U.S. trade and investment, including services exports. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Limitations on Foreign Ownership Foreign investment in certain sectors is subject to local participation requirements that take the form of joint ventures with mandated minimum ownership interests held by ethnic Malaysian individuals or entities. When applying for certain operating licenses, registrations, permits, and approvals, entities with foreign ownership most commonly comply with the local participation requirements through a 70-30 equity split between the foreign investors (who are limited to a maximum of 70 percent ownership) and ethnic Malaysian individuals or entities (which must have a minimum 30 percent stake). Sector-specific regulators set the applicable local participation requirements, including in banking and insurance, education, freight forwarding and logistics, power generation, water, media and entertainment, and cable and satellite telecommunications. In the oil and gas industry, non-Malaysian firms are permitted to participate in oil services in partnership with local firms and are restricted to the maximum of 49 percent equity stake if the foreign partner is the principal shareholder. Foreign investments are also prohibited in terrestrial broadcast networks. SUBSIDIES Export Subsidies Malaysia maintains several programs relating to exports, distinct from the pioneer status and investment tax allowance programs listed in Malaysia’s subsidies notifications to the WTO. For example, the normal and enhanced allowance for increased exports programs provide for tax deductions of up to 70 percent of statutory income for increased exports. Malaysia has not included these measures in its WTO subsidies notifications. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-269-2048.jpg) ![262 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS MEXICO TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) entered into force on July 1, 2020. The USMCA maintains the zero tariffs that were in place among the three countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement and modernized the agreement to include strong, enforceable labor and environmental obligations, ground-breaking provisions to combat non-market practices, and provisions covering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). IMPORT POLICIES Non-Tariff Barriers Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation Mexico continues to provide insufficient prior notification of procedural changes, inconsistent interpretation of regulatory requirements at different border posts, and uneven border enforcement of Mexican standards and labeling rules. Often, notification of new customs or tax requirements is provided two weeks or less before entry into force, leaving U.S. exporters little time to adjust their systems to accommodate and comply with the change. Opportunity to comment on proposed regulatory amendments is also often as short as seven days. Some goods are still not allowed to be imported at all ports of entry. Restricting goods to certain ports has made it difficult for U.S. exporters to arrange for transportation and logistics, especially for electronic commerce purchases from U.S. SME exporters. The USMCA prohibits arbitrary limits on the number of ports at which a customs broker may operate. Yet, Article 161 of Mexico’s Customs law limits a broker to operate at four ports if the broker is not part of a customs agency. The United States continues to urge Mexico to amend the law to allow brokers to operate at any port where the broker is able to perform its duties. The USMCA also requires that Mexico implement a periodic payment option for express delivery shipments, which Mexico had not done as of December 2024. In addition, U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns about a new requirement to access simplified procedures for shipments to Mexico valued under $2,500. On October 14, 2024, the Mexican Government finalized a new regulation that requires delivery service providers to obtain and store the tax identification number of the shipment recipient in order for simplified formalities to apply. The USMCA provides that shipments under $2,500 must have access to simplified procedures unless they have been broken-down to avoid formal entry, and this new requirement impedes U.S. service providers from accessing these simplified procedures. Other Market Access Barriers Medical Devices, Supplies, and Pharmaceuticals Industry continues to report delays of 18 months to 24 months for adjudication of sanitary registrations and import permit applications. Overall, the regulatory environment has shown minor improvements, but more structural changes need to be made to facilitate registration in Mexico. Although the Federal Commission ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-270-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 263 for Protection Against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS) continues to work through its backlog, companies that try to register U.S. Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved products in Mexico continue to report delays of more than a year. Regulatory delay remains a primary barrier to entering the Mexican market for medical devices and pharmaceuticals. COFEPRIS reportedly continues to be understaffed, with insufficient capacity to grant sanitary registrations and conduct factory inspections to issue good manufacturing practices certifications within the established timeframes. COFEPRIS is in the process of implementing reliance mechanisms for approvals and inspections and, as part of these efforts, continues to hold technical regulatory discussions with the FDA to identify opportunities to improve its review process. Glyphosate Mexico’s Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) has rejected import permits for glyphosate-containing chemical products. Mexico has not provided an opportunity for public comment, submitted notifications to the World Trade Organization (WTO), or provided scientific evidence for the rejections. Glyphosate remains registered for use in Mexico. Separately, on January 1, 2021, a decree that called for the phaseout of the use of glyphosate and glyphosate- containing products by January 31, 2024, entered into force. The decree also prohibits Mexico from using glyphosate in any government-sponsored programs during the phaseout period. A subsequent decree, published on February 13, 2023, extended the phaseout deadline to March 31, 2024. During the phaseout period, Mexico’s National Council of Humanities, Sciences and Technology was tasked with studying, developing, and promoting alternatives to glyphosate. On March 26, 2024, SEMARNAT, the Secretariats of Economy and Agriculture and Rural Development, and COFEPRIS announced the postponement of the phaseout of the use of glyphosate and glyphosate-containing products until a viable alternative is found. Mexico is implementing import quotas for glyphosate and glyphosate-containing products. On July 3, 2024, COFEPRIS reduced the quota for imports of glyphosate, to 1,138 tons of formulated glyphosate and 86 tons of technical glyphosate. The United States continues to press Mexico to grant import permits for glyphosate and glyphosate- containing products, consistent with the fact that glyphosate remains registered for use in Mexico. Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals U.S. companies continue to report significant delays in receiving the necessary registration and marketing approvals from COFEPRIS for certain pesticides and agricultural chemicals. These delays appear to impact both applications for registration and applications for reregistration, sometimes involving only administrative updates such as changing the company’s address. Companies report COFEPRIS is not granting registration renewals for many pesticide molecules. Consequently, some license holders have lost their registrations and the ability to import pesticides and agricultural chemicals. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade Implementing Regulation for the Quality Infrastructure Law In August 2024, Mexico published a draft implementing regulation for the July 2020 Quality Infrastructure Law on the National Regulatory Improvement Commission’s (CONAMER) website.

The United States will continue closely monitoring the status of the draft regulation and urging Mexico to ensure the final measure is aligned with Mexico’s USMCA obligations. Local Specific Absorption Testing Requirements The United States continues to express concerns with regulations that Mexico’s telecommunications regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), published in 2020 pursuant to Technical Provision IFT-012-2019 that pose a barrier to trade for mobile telecommunications products by requiring in-country testing for Specific Absorption Rates and reference out-of-date standards from the International Electrochemical Commission/Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. The requirements include duplicative testing and may cause delays, as Mexico has a limited number of accredited facilities able to perform the required tests. The United States will continue to press Mexico to use the latest testing standards and to include testing to these standards in the scope of the Mutual Recognition Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States for Conformity Assessment of Telecommunications Equipment. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers Fresh Potatoes Since 2003, the United States has sought access for fresh potatoes to all of Mexico, beyond a 26-kilometer zone along the U.S.–Mexico border outside of which imports were not permitted. In April 2021, the Supreme Court of Mexico affirmed the authority of Mexico’s regulatory agency to expand access for U.S. fresh potatoes. Subsequently, in 2021, Mexico completed the regulatory steps necessary for access for U.S. fresh potatoes to cities with populations over 100,000 people. In May 2022, the United States began shipping fresh potatoes to Mexico beyond the 26-kilometer zone. The United States is monitoring the situation to ensure transparent and predictable access for U.S. exporters and that requirements are based on science. Products of Agricultural Biotechnology Mexico’s Biosafety Law requires COFEPRIS to decide on a complete application for authorization covering the importation and sale of genetically engineered (GE) products within six months of receipt. The United States has expressed serious concerns that certain decisions on applications were not based on science and were subject to significant delays. On February 13, 2023, the Mexican Government published a decree that bans the use of GE corn in tortillas and dough and instructs Mexican Government agencies to gradually substitute—i.e., restrict and eventually ban—the use of GE corn in all products for human consumption and for animal feed. In March 2023, the United States requested and held technical consultations with Mexico regarding its measures concerning GE products under the USMCA Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Chapter, but the consultations did not resolve the matter. In June 2023, the United States requested and held dispute settlement consultations with Mexico regarding its measures under the USMCA Dispute Settlement Chapter, but these consultations also failed to resolve the matter. On August 17, 2023, the United States established a USMCA dispute settlement panel challenging the aforementioned measures reflected in Mexico’s February 13, 2023 decree on the basis that these measures are not based on science and undermine the market access Mexico agreed ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-272-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 265 to provide in the USMCA. In June 2024, the United States participated in a hearing before the dispute settlement panel. In December 2024, a final panel report was published, in which the panel agreed with the United States on all seven legal claims under the USMCA. On February 5, 2025, Mexico published a measure that declares ineffective the measures that USTR successfully challenged in the USMCA dispute. The United States will continue to monitor closely Mexico’s compliance with its USMCA commitments to ensure that Mexico’s agricultural biotechnology measures are based on science and provide U.S. corn growers the market access that Mexico agreed to provide in the USMCA. Genetically Engineered Cotton Mexico rejected applications for cultivation of GE cotton in 2019 and 2020. No applications were submitted in 2021, 2022, and 2024. In 2023, companies submitted three applications for experimental field trials of new GE cotton varieties. Mexico had not decided on these applications as of December 31, 2024. GE cotton has been cultivated in Mexico for 25 years with no evidence of adverse impact on the environment, biodiversity, or animal or plant health. The United States continues to press Mexico to reconsider rejected applications, complete its approval procedure without undue delay, and use a science- and risk-based approval process. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Mexico was listed on the Watch List in the 2024 Special 301 Report. Obstacles to U.S. trade in intellectual property (IP) intensive goods and services include the wide availability of pirated and counterfeit goods, via both physical and online markets. As broadband access increases, so has online piracy, and stakeholders report that Mexico has one of the highest rates of music and video game piracy in the world. Overall criminal enforcement of IP rights, including online, continues to be characterized by weak coordination among federal, state, and municipal officials; limited resources for prosecutions; the lack of sustained investigations targeting suppliers of counterfeit and pirated goods and services; and the lack of sufficient penalties to deter violations. Brand owners also face bad faith trademark registrations, making it important for companies to register their trademarks early. Moreover, rights holders continue to express concern about the length of administrative and judicial patent and trademark infringement proceedings and the persistence of continuing infringement while cases remain pending. The El Santuario and the Mercado San Juan de Dios markets in Guadalajara and the Tepito market in Mexico City are listed in the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy (Notorious Markets List) for selling pirated and counterfeit goods. With respect to geographical indications (GIs), Mexico and the European Union (EU) concluded negotiations on a free trade agreement in which Mexico agreed to protect hundreds of names for foodstuffs, wines, and beers. The United States remains concerned about the EU practice of negotiating product- specific IP outcomes as a condition of market access and reiterates the importance of each individual IP right being evaluated on its individual merit in Mexico. In a USMCA side letter, Mexico confirmed that market access of U.S. products is not restricted in Mexico due to the mere use of certain individual cheese terms. Mexico has a sui generis system of protection for GIs that includes certain elements aimed at improving and respecting due process and transparency. In 2020, Mexico enacted a new Federal Law for the Protection of Industrial Property and amended its Federal Copyright Law and Federal Criminal Code with a view to complying with various provisions of the USMCA and strengthening IP protection. Mexico is still in the process of drafting regulations for both the Federal Law for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Federal Copyright Law amendments, and the lack of regulations is creating uncertainty for the creative and innovative sectors looking to protect and enforce their IP.

SERVICES BARRIERS Electronic Payments Services The United States continues to closely monitor developments with respect to Mexico’s evolving policy framework for electronic payment service suppliers. Aspects of the existing policy framework limit the ability of U.S. electronic payment service suppliers to supply their complete suite of value-added services on a cross-border basis, including fraud protection, and differentiate themselves in the marketplace. On September 14, 2023, Mexico’s Federal Economic Competition Commission identified barriers to competition in the card payment processing market and issued recommendations to Mexico’s Central Bank—Banxico—and the National Commission for Banking and Securities to restore conditions for competition. As Mexico considers updating its regulations, the United States continues to urge Mexico to facilitate a competitive market and level playing field for U.S. electronic payment service suppliers, aligned with Mexico’s USMCA obligations. Mexico issued regulations in 2021 relating to the use of cloud service suppliers by electronic payment fund institutions. The United States continues to be concerned by the length, complexity, and uncertainty of the approval process for electronic payment fund institutions that seek to use secure, U.S.-based cloud computing services, raising questions about the extent to which the approvals are tacitly being conditioned on using local computing facilities. Insurance Services Multiple U.S. companies report that Mexico’s Tax Administration Service (SAT) has changed its interpretation of its laws and that, as a result, insurance companies have been required to retroactively pay value-added tax on damage claims stretching as far back as 2015. U.S. companies have expressed concerns that SAT is not applying the law in a sound and consistent manner and that this sudden change may lead to insolvency for some insurers in Mexico. Telecommunications Services Notwithstanding the sweeping reforms of the telecommunications sector in 2013 and 2014, new market entrants still must compete with the traditional dominant supplier, which has maintained a market share of almost 70 percent and was designated as a “preponderant economic agent” by the IFT. The entrenched position maintained by this dominant supplier, particularly regarding the mobile services market, demonstrates the continued need for vigilant enforcement of the regulations IFT adopted to address that supplier’s status as a preponderant economic agent. A December 2024 constitutional amendment that eliminates certain independent, autonomous regulatory agencies in Mexico, including the IFT, has raised significant concerns regarding Mexico’s continued compliance with its USMCA obligations. While IFT still existed as of December 2024, the Mexican Government plans to pass secondary laws that will place some IFT functions into a new digital transformation and telecommunications agency and other functions into a new anti-monopoly competition agency. The cost of spectrum in Mexico is one of the highest in Latin America. Although Mexico assigns spectrum licenses through competitive auctions, it imposes a substantial annual fee based on the amount of spectrum held by each licensee. This approach is out of sync with international best practices. It appears that the structure of Mexico’s annual spectrum fee may advantage the dominant supplier and led another supplier ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-274-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 267 to return to the Government of Mexico all the spectrum it had been awarded. The Government of Mexico dismissed several proposals to lower the costs made by the IFT and the private sector. The United States continues to press Mexico to consider changes to its rules that would lower overall costs for spectrum and address the market power of the dominant supplier. INVESTMENT BARRIERS Energy Sector Since December 2018, Mexico has pursued an energy policy centered on reinstating the primacy of its state- owned electric utility, Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), and state-owned oil and gas company, Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX). Mexico has undertaken various measures to achieve this aim. For example, in March 2021, the Mexican Congress amended its Electric Power Industry Law to require Mexico’s national grid operator to prioritize the supply of CFE-generated electricity into the grid over electricity generated by private power companies, regardless of cost or environmental impact. Additionally, private companies operating in Mexico are often unable to participate effectively, if at all, in Mexico’s energy sector due to frequent delays, unexplained or unjustified rejections, and inaction regarding applications for new permits or permit modifications. Unexplained or unjustified suspensions or revocations of existing permits, as well as other impediments, also undermine private companies’ ability to operate renewable energy facilities (e.g., wind and solar installations), import or export electricity or fuel, store or transload fuel, and build or operate retail fuel stations. In addition, in December 2019, Mexico’s energy regulator granted PEMEX an extension to 2026 to comply with maximum sulfur content requirements under its fuel standard for certain parts of Mexico. This extension temporarily exempts PEMEX from having to sell only ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel throughout the country. Without the extension, PEMEX would have had to import ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel from the United States or upgrade its facilities to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel in sufficient quantities. In June 2022, Mexico’s Secretary of Energy announced a new policy that would require users of Mexico’s gas transportation network to source natural gas from either PEMEX or CFE. Multiple U.S. companies have reported exiting Mexico’s energy market as a direct consequence of these measures. In July 2022, the United States requested consultations with Mexico under USMCA Chapter 31 regarding these measures, and the United States continues to engage with Mexico in these consultations on specific and concrete steps Mexico must take to address the concerns set out in the consultations request. In January 2024, the Mexican Supreme Court found unconstitutional key parts of the 2021 amendment to the Electric Power Industry Law. However, in October 2024, Mexico ratified a constitutional amendment to reclassify CFE and PEMEX as “public enterprises” rather than “productive enterprises” in an effort to undermine the participation of private companies, including U.S. companies, in Mexico’s energy market. In January 2025, President introduced a reform package of six energy-related bills that, inter alia, include as a principle a guarantee of CFE’s prevalence and its maintenance of at least 54 percent of the average energy sent to the grid, require CFE ownership of at least 54 percent in any “mixed investment” electricity generation projects, and set out a preference for CFE over private individuals in electricity generation and marketing.

As of December 31, 2024, the proposed amendment has not yet been voted on by the full Chamber of Deputies. Mining Sector The Government of Mexico passed legislation in April 2022 amending the national mining law to establish greater state control over the country’s lithium resources. The amendments place the exploration, exploitation, and utilization of Mexico’s lithium under the exclusive control of a newly created state-owned company, LitioMx, and exclude private companies from concessions, licenses, contracts, permits, and authorizations to undertake those activities. The amendments also authorize the government to declare other minerals as “strategic resources” that would allow greater state control in the future. As of December 31, 2024, the Mexican Government was still drafting implementing measures for the amendments. The United States continues to monitor Mexico’s implementation of these amendments. In August 2024, the Constitutional Committee of Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban open-pit mining activities relating to the exploration, exploitation, benefit, or use of minerals, metals, and metalloids, except in cases determined by the Government of Mexico for strategic national development reasons. As of December 31, 2024, the proposed amendment had not been voted on by the full Chamber of Deputies. Restricted Sectors Mexico restricts foreign investment in certain sectors under the Foreign Investment Law. Certain sectors, such as transportation infrastructure, are entirely closed to foreign investment. Foreign ownership is capped at 49 percent for express delivery companies and land for agricultural, livestock, and forestry purposes, as well as port administration services. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-276-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 269 MOROCCO TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–Morocco Free Trade Agreement The United States–Morocco Free Trade Agreement (USMFTA) entered into force on January 1, 2006. Morocco immediately eliminated duties on 95 percent of industrial and consumer goods. Morocco implemented phased tariff reductions culminating in the complete elimination of duties on most goods by 2016. Some sensitive agricultural products have longer periods for duty elimination and may be subject to other provisions, including tariff-rate quotas (TRQs). Goods from key U.S. export sectors such as information technology, machinery, construction equipment, chemicals, and textiles receive either duty- free or other preferential duty treatment when entering Morocco. The United States and Morocco consult regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the Agreement and to address outstanding issues. The United States–Morocco Joint Committee is the central oversight body for the USMFTA. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs On January 1, 2024, as prescribed in the USMFTA, Morocco published Circular 6519/222, announcing tariff changes for calendar year 2024. The circular includes a list of products for which tariffs have been phased out in 2024, products for which tariffs are not yet fully liberalized, and updated agricultural TRQs and agricultural safeguard measures for the period from January 1 through December 31, 2024. A notable change includes the imposition of additional safeguard measures on frozen, fresh, or chilled chicken legs and wings. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE/ SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade In 2023, Morocco adopted Decree No. 2.10.421 of Ramadan 5, 1445 which stipulates that starting in January 2024, vehicles that are not aligned with the Euro 6b standard for emissions may no longer be registered in the country. Heavy vehicles have an additional 24 months to comply. Morocco generally only allows the importation of automobiles meeting the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) 1958 Agreement vehicle standards, effectively barring many automobiles produced in the United States from entering the Moroccan market. Although the Moroccan Government has officially allowed for the importation of automobiles that meet the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards since 2016 (under Decree No. 2-15-89 of Ramadan 3, 1437), U.S. companies continue to report that Moroccan Customs has still not adopted a procedure to regularize this process. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers In October 2022, Morocco’s National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) implemented a health requirement for non-animal origin feed to originate from areas free of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) or be quarantined for 30 days upon arrival. Morocco did not notify this requirement to the World Trade Organization. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has repeatedly conveyed various risk assessments to ONSSA to demonstrate that the risk of spreading HPAI ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-277-2048.jpg) ![270 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS via grain shipments is unlikely or negligible. Nevertheless, Morocco continues to require an attestation by the relevant government competent authority that non-animal origin feed is free of HPAI and/or has been isolated for 30 days. The United States remains concerned as Morocco has not shared a risk assessment to support its requirement for health attestations and quarantine. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Inadequate intellectual property protection and enforcement in Morocco continues to be an area of concern. Although the United States acknowledges the efforts of Morocco to combat piracy and trade in counterfeit goods, Morocco faces challenges with digital piracy and continues to be a thriving market for counterfeit products. The United States and Morocco continue to engage on matters related to Morocco’s policy toward geographical indications (GIs). The United States remains concerned that the European Union (EU) has pursued negotiations with Morocco and other countries that would require partner countries to adopt overly broad protection of EU GIs as a condition of market access into the EU. The United States continues to reiterate to Morocco the importance of each GI being independently evaluated on its individual merits, with adequate due process requirements. SERVICES BARRIERS Although Morocco’s insurance regulations do not appear to make formal distinctions based on national origin, U.S. insurance suppliers have reported that, in practice, the Moroccan regulatory body (part of the Ministry of Economy and Finance) applies an authorization process that has impeded U.S. insurance companies from introducing products that compete with Moroccan firms. OTHER BARRIERS U.S. firms have cited irregularities with regard to certain government procedures, including a lack of clear and accessible information about new regulations and certifications relating to imports into the country, as among the greatest obstacles to investment with Morocco. In particular, U.S. companies have pointed to difficulties they encounter in processes for obtaining import permits, land use approvals, and other government permissions. U.S. companies have also noted the challenges created by rigid protocols and excessive bureaucracy, which can lead to long wait times for decisions and permissions particularly when dealing with public sector entities. Morocco’s property registration procedures also continue to impede business. In an effort to avoid an excessive drain on foreign exchange, Moroccan authorities allow Moroccan companies to prepay only up to 30 percent of a shipment’s total value in advance of importation. These restrictions on purchasers are often problematic for U.S. exporters that require 100 percent advance payment. Some U.S. exporters use letters of credit to mitigate the effect of these limitations, but these are costly and many U.S. exporters report lengthy payment delays. While Moroccan officials had indicated in 2019 that the 30 percent limit would be phased out over an indefinite timeline, it remained in effect as of December 31, 2024. The United States continues to press for removal of the limitation. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-278-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 271 NEW ZEALAND TRADE AGREEMENTS The United States–New Zealand Trade and Investment Framework Agreement The United States and New Zealand signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement on October 2, 1992.

IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs New Zealand’s average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 1.9 percent in 2023 (latest data available). New Zealand’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 1.4 percent for agricultural products and 2.0 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). New Zealand has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 9.5 percent. As of 2023, New Zealand applied a zero percent duty on an MFN basis on 72.5 percent of its tariff lines in agricultural goods and on 65.1 percent of its tariff lines in non-agricultural goods. SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Animal Health New Zealand maintains restrictions on imports of pork from the United States related to concerns that certain pork products may transmit animal diseases, which do not appear to be grounded in science and risk. Imports of U.S. frozen or chilled pork products weighing more than three kilograms must be cooked, canned, or undergo further processing within New Zealand. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION The United States continues to monitor developments to amend the Medicines Act 1981 and any developments regarding the Geographical Indications (Wine and Spirits) Registration Act 2006, particularly in light of the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and New Zealand in May 2024.

The United States and the other CAFTA–DR countries meet regularly to review the implementation and functioning of the Agreement and to address outstanding issues. IMPORT POLICIES Tariffs and Taxes Tariffs As a member of the Central American Common Market, Nicaragua applies a harmonized external tariff on most items (approximately 95 percent of Nicaragua’s tariff lines) at a maximum of 15 percent, with some exceptions. However, under the CAFTA–DR, as of January 1, 2015, U.S. non-agricultural goods enter Nicaragua duty free. In addition, nearly all U.S. agricultural exports enter Nicaragua duty free under the CAFTA–DR. Nicaragua eliminated its tariffs on rice and chicken leg quarters on January 1, 2023, and has eliminated tariffs on dairy products as of January 1, 2025. For certain agricultural products, tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) permit duty- free access for specified quantities during the tariff phase-out period, with the duty-free amount expanding during that period. Nicaragua completed its tariff phase-out for white corn on January 1, 2025, through the expansion of its TRQ to 7,000 metric tons. Nicaragua is required under the CAFTA–DR to make TRQs available on January 1 of each year. Nicaragua monitors its TRQs through an import licensing system, which the United States carefully tracks to ensure the timely issuance of these permits. Taxes The Nicaraguan Government levies a consumption tax of 15 percent to 42 percent on certain luxury items. Since 2019, Nicaraguan customs officials have calculated this tax based on an estimated purchase price that is often inflated beyond the actual price or fair market value of these items, leading imported goods to be less cost-competitive in the Nicaraguan market. Other products, such as alcoholic beverages, are also taxed based on a presumed purchase price. The selective consumption tax may disadvantage foreign suppliers because the Nicaraguan tax authorities assess tax on domestic products based on the actual purchase price. The National Institute of Information and Development has provided a schedule of retail prices that is supposed to serve as a baseline for this tax, but businesses report that customs authorities often do not use the schedule. In addition, some large businesses report being unable to secure corporate tax refunds when the sum of their monthly estimated tax payments exceeds the amount of actual tax owed at the end of the year. Some companies have also stated that filing for a refund has resulted in additional tax complications, including audits, added taxes, and penalties. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-280-2048.jpg) ![FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 273 Non-Tariff Barriers Customs Barriers and Trade Facilitation The Nicaraguan Customs Authority (DGA) has become increasingly aggressive in contesting declared value and the originating status of imports. This can result in importers having to pay substantial sums in unpaid duties and associated fines for shipments to be released. Businesses report that Nicaraguan customs officials routinely delay customs inspections and levy arbitrary fines for minor paperwork problems such as typographical errors. These fines can exceed the value of the shipments. U.S. exporters report that nearly all shipments are subject to physical inspection. Some businesses have expressed concern that customs officials might target shipments for additional scrutiny based on political considerations. Starting in 2019, the DGA began seeking additional proof of country of origin for various types of products that had previously been established as originating under the CAFTA–DR, by requiring importers to complete a comprehensive questionnaire seeking detailed information about the products. Multiple businesses have reported that the requested information includes proprietary business data and trade secrets that are not pertinent to a rule of origin determination. Businesses have tried to provide proof of origin to the DGA without divulging trade secrets through site visits to production plants and staff interviews. However, the DGA has most often rejected those proposals and, in multiple cases when importers failed to complete the questionnaire, has initiated administrative processes to remove preferential treatment under the CAFTA–DR and has sought retroactive tariffs for entire periods during which the product was imported with preferential treatment. The DGA’s increased scrutiny of the proof of origin of imports has led to delays at customs and arbitrary fines for businesses. In multiple cases, the DGA also levied a separate fine that doubled the amount owed. Some importers have indicated that they prefer to immediately pay taxes and tariffs as though the goods were not eligible for preferential treatment under the CAFTA-DR, rather than engaging in lengthy and expensive litigation. U.S. exporters have reported that the DGA has ignored or rejected documentation of origin for various products provided by U.S. Government or local government agencies as proof of origin for many agricultural commodities. The businesses contend that, in many cases, even fully completing the additional questionnaires and complying with the DGA’s requests for additional documentation has not resulted in approval of a claim for preferential treatment. TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE / SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY BARRIERS Technical Barriers to Trade U.S. industry has raised concerns that food product registration in Nicaragua can be complicated and arbitrary. The Nicaraguan Ministry of Health requires a Certificate of Free Sale for product registration. The United States does not issue these certificates at the national level, and they are not uniformly available to U.S. exporters. In some cases, U.S. companies have satisfied the requirement by submitting documents that are issued by some U.S. states, local government authorities, or trade organizations. However, not all U.S. manufacturers are in jurisdictions or affiliated with institutions that issue such documents and, therefore, some cannot gain approval to sell in the Nicaraguan market. U.S. food companies have expressed concern regarding Law 842 (2013), which requires that all processed food products be marked with an expiration date. Nicaraguan officials have at times interpreted “Best By” dates, which indicate food quality or freshness rather than food safety, as expiration dates, and have destroyed products exceeding those dates. Nicaraguan importers of U.S. products have complained that ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2025nte-250403071439-a7c59daa/75/Trump-2-0-Liberation-Day-Trade-Tariffs-Report-on-Trade-Barriers-281-2048.jpg) ![274 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS the law imposes costs on food importers, especially for products that do not typically have expiration dates. Nicaraguan importers continue to work with suppliers to include expiration dates on the translated Spanish label as required by the Central American Technical Regulation on General Labeling of Prepackaged Food Products (RTCA 67.01.07:10). Sanitary and Phytosanitary Barriers U.S. exporters have faced multiple container rejections since 2021 as a result of Nicaragua’s interpretation of a Central American Technical Regulation for fresh/chilled/frozen meat (RTCA 67.04.50:17). Among the Central American countries applying the regulation, only Nicaragua applies a 20 percent threshold requirement for the presence of Salmonella on raw chicken. Additionally, Nicaragua enforces a ‘zero tolerance’ standard for Salmonella and generic Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria on raw pork meat. Most of the shipments rejected by Nicaragua have been successfully returned to the United States and passed subsequent food safety inspections by U.S. regulators. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT Suppliers have reported significant hurdles that have inhibited their ability to successfully compete for sales to Nicaraguan Government entities. Industry reports that the Nicaraguan Government has not always followed the requirements in their procurement law, including by not adhering to the minimum time periods required for open bids, creating terms of reference and technical specifications that are frequently unclear, and including requirements for financial guarantees and local legal representation that create significant challenges for U.S. firms. U.S. businesses also report that the rule of law is weak and there is corruption, which is particularly apparent in government procurement. Nicaragua is neither a Party to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), nor an observer to the WTO Committee on Government Procurement. Nicaragua has binding international procurement obligations under the CAFTA–DR. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION Despite a strong legal framework to implement CAFTA–DR commitments on intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, concerns remain, including optical disc and broadcast media piracy and the use of unlicensed software in Nicaragua. Furthermore, the sale of counterfeit and pirated goods is reportedly widespread throughout Nicaragua. The United States has expressed concern to the Nicaraguan Government about inadequate IP enforcement, as well as the need to ensure transparency in procedures relating to the protections for geographical indications. The United States will continue to monitor Nicaragua’s implementation of its IP obligations under the CAFTA–DR.

Nigeria’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 15.9 percent for agricultural products and 11.4 percent for non-agricultural products in 2023 (latest data available). Nigeria has bound 19.7 percent of its tariff lines in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an average WTO bound tariff rate of 120.5 percent. Consistent with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Common External Tariff (CET), Nigeria applies five tariff bands: (1) zero percent duty on essential social goods (e.g., medicine); (2) 5 percent duty on essential commodities, raw materials, and capital goods; (3) 10 percent duty on intermediate goods; (4) 20 percent duty on consumer goods; and, (5) 35 percent duty on certain goods that the Nigerian Government has elected to afford greater protection. The CET was slated to be fully harmonized by 2020, but, in practice, some ECOWAS Member States have maintained deviations from the CET beyond the January 1, 2020 deadline. Taxes Nigeria maintains a number of supplemental taxes in addition to the duties on imports of certain goods, which significantly raises the effective tariff rate paid by importers. For example, Nigeria maintains a combined duty plus other associated import fees of 50 percent or more on 79 tariff lines. These include 17 tariff lines on which the combined duty plus other associated import fees reaches or surpasses the 70 percent limit set by ECOWAS. Non-Tariff Barriers Import Bans The Nigeria Customs Service continues to ban the import of 25 different product categories. The list of prohibited imports currently includes: bird eggs; cocoa butter, powder, and cakes; pork; beef; live or dead birds; refined vegetable oil and fats; bottled water; spaghetti and other noodles; fruit juice in retail packs; tomatoes, tomato ketchup, and tomato sauces; nonalcoholic beverages (excluding energy drinks); bagged cement; beer and stout; all medicaments falling under Harmonized System headings 3003 and 3004; soaps and detergents; mosquito repellant coils; paper board; used motor vehicles more than 12 years old; ball point pens; most types of footwear; bags and suitcases; used clothing; and certain spirits and alcohols.

The Nigeria Customs Service’s practices continue to present major obstacles to trade. Importers report inconsistent application of customs regulations; lengthy clearance procedures, often due to outdated manual processing systems; and corruption. These factors sometimes contribute to product deterioration and result in significant losses for importers of perishable goods. Disputes among Nigerian Government agencies over the interpretation of regulations often cause delays, and frequent changes in customs guidelines slow the movement of goods through Nigerian ports. The customs authority has attempted to automate its processes, but many basic customs procedures are still paper-based and require an unreasonably long time to complete. On September 2, 2020, the Nigerian Government approved a $3.1 billion customs modernization project that would include the automation of paper-based customs processes. The project was to be completed in 36 months and executed via a public-private partnership through a 20-year concession. This project has experienced implementation delays a",

The slain Maoists were identified as Gautam Paswan, CPI-Maoist ‘Bihar-Jharkhand Special Area Committee (BJSAC)’ member, who had a reward of INR 2.5 million on his head; Ajit Oraon _alias_ Charlis, BJSAC member, with an INR 2.5 million reward; Amar Ganjhu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; Ajay Yadav _alias_ Nandu, ‘sub-zonal commander’ with a reward of INR 500,000; and Sanjeet Bhuiyan, ‘sub-zonal commander’. During the search operation, the dead bodies of the five Maoists along with two AK-47 rifles, one INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, two other rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as items of daily use were recovered. On April 1, 2023, a CPI-Maoist cadre, Sameer Mohonda _alias_ Sadhu Linga (31), a member of the CPI-Maoist ‘Chatgaon Local Organizational Squad’, with a reward of INR 200,000 on his head, was killed in an encounter with C-60 Commandos in the Kiarkoti-Abujhmad Forest area of Bhamragarh _Taluka_ (revenue division) in the Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra. Acting on intelligence inputs, the Commandos launched an operation and came under indiscriminate fire from a group of 60 to 70 Maoists hiding in the forest, who used Under Barrel Grenade Launchers (UBGLs) and other weapons. In the retaliatory fire, the C-60 Commandos killed one Maoist, while the others managed to flee into the dense forest. After the firing, which lasted for approximately an hour, the Security Forces (SFs) searched the area and recovered one .303 rifle, one gun, a country-made pistol, three magazines, 31 bullets, INR 38,000, medicines, Maoist literature and other materials. On March 28, 2023, a former deputy _Sarpanch_ (head of the _Panchayat_, village level local self-Government institution), Ramji Dodi, was abducted and killed by CPI-Maoist cadres in Zara village in the Narayanpur District of Chhattisgarh. Dodi was abducted, along with his two nephews, and taken to a forest where he was allegedly strangled to death by the Maoists. The nephews were released with Ramji’s body and a letter saying that he was killed because he was a ‘police informer’. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), there has been a total of 39 fatalities (20 civilians, nine SF personnel and 10 _Naxalites_, Left Wing Extremists) in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-linked violence in the current year (data till April 9, 2023). During the corresponding period of 2022, the number of such fatalities was 49 (19 civilians, seven SF personnel and 23 _Naxalites_). Through 2022, there was a total of 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) in such violence. In the preceding year (2021), there was a total of 237 fatalities (58 civilians, 51 SF personnel, and 128 _Naxalites_). Overall fatalities were at 239 in 2020, 302 in 2019, 412 in 2018 and 335 in 2017. Overall fatalities have, thus, been on a decline since 2019. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2022 were the lowest recorded in a single year since March 6, 2000, when SATP started compiling data on LWE. Interestingly, the overall fatalities in 2021 were the pervious lowest recorded in a single year. A peak of 1,180 fatalities (630 civilians, 267 SF personnel, 265 _Naxalites_ and 18 unspecified) were recorded in 2010. As with overall fatalities, fatalities in 2022 in all three categories – civilian, SF and _Naxalite_ – were the lowest since 2000. A previous low of 58 in the civilian category was record in 2021. In the SF category, the previous low of 44 was recorded in 2020. A previous low of 87 in the _Naxalite_ category was recorded in 2004. Civilian and _Naxalite_ fatalities have also been on a continuous decline since 2019. SF fatalities have also declined through this period, barring 2021 (51 fatalities) when there was a spike compared to 2020 (44 fatalities). Other parameters of violence also indicate significant improvement in the security situation relating to LWE activities across the country. The number of overall LWE-linked terrorist incidents fell from 676 in 2021 to 602 in 2022. In particular, incidents of killing came down from 124 in 2021 to 107 in 2022. Seven of the 107 overall incidents of killing were major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) in 2022. In 2021, the number of major incidents was 15. Resultant fatalities from major incidents declined from 114 (seven civilians, 30 SF personnel, and 77 _Naxalites_) in 2021 to 22 (one civilian, three SF personnel, and 18 _Naxalites_) in 2022. In 2023, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents was 169, of which 32 were incidents of killing. Two major incidents have already been recorded in 2023. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2022, at 1:4.46, the best since 2000, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2021, the ratio was at 1:2.5. The ratio has remined in favour of the SFs since 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.61). In the current year, the kill ratio is in favour of the SFs at 1:1.11, so far (data till April 6, 2023). SFs arrested 395 _Naxalites_ in 2022, in addition to 409 in 2021, according to partial data compiled by SATP. In the current year, as on April 6, 2023, 122 arrests had been recorded. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 15,993 has been recorded. The mounting pressure on _Naxalites_ has yielded a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP, at least 2,855 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2022, in addition to 533 in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of surrenders was 97. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 16,581 LWEs have surrendered. Through 2022, SFs recovered arms from the Maoists in 190 incidents, in addition to 268 such incidents of recovery in 2021. During the current year, as on April 6, 2023, the number of such incidents are 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,694 incidents of arms recovery are documented. An analysis of over-ground and underground Maoist activities in the country’s LWE-affected areas also suggests a diminishing influence. According to SATP, in 2022, Maoist activities were reported from 10 States in comparison to 11 States in 2021. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 10 affected States have a total of 310 Districts, of which 58 recorded a Maoist presence. Of these 58, three districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 27 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 28 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2021, of 79 affected districts, one district fell in the ‘extremely-affected’ category, four in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 46 were ‘marginally affected’. Indeed, on March 28, 2023, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question in the _Lok Sabha_ (Lower House of the Indian Parliament), announced that the number of districts most affected by LWE had reduced from 35 in 2017 to 30 in April 2018, and then to 25 in July **[2021](https://pqals.nic.in/annex/1711/AU4464.pdf)**. Further, on March 28, 2023, the Government stated that the “geographical spread of violence has significantly reduced and only 176 Police Stations of 45 districts reported LWE violence in 2022, as compared to a high of 465 Police Stations of 96 districts in 2010”. Conspicuously, all major LWE-affected states across the country — **[Andhra Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-30)**, **[Bihar](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-31#assessment2)**, **[Chhattisgarh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-29#assessment2)**, **[Jharkhand](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-33#assessment2)**, **[Kerala](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-39#assessment2)**, **[Madhya Pradesh](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-40#assessment2)**, **[Maharashtra](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-38#assessment2)**, **[Odisha](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-34#assessment2)**, and **[Telangana](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-37)** have witnessed an overall improvement in the security situation. Nevertheless, the Maoist challenge persists. OThe Perilous **[Bastar Division](https://satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-21-No-22#assessment2)**, the safe haven of the residual Maoist problem not only in Chhattisgarh but across the entire LWE-affected region, comprising seven densely forested districts - Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur and Sukma - sprawling across 40,000 square kilometers, in the southernmost region of the state, is the location of the last Maoist bastions. On November 7, 2022, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, Sundarraj P., asserting that the SFs were committed to wiping out the Maoist threat, nevertheless accepted, | | | --- | | In Bastar Range, though civilian killings have reduced to a great extent, from 279 in the year 2006, to 29 in 2022, it is still an area of major concern in left-wing extremist affected areas. | Indeed, on March 28, 2023, the Maoists abducted and killed two villagers, in Narayanpur and Sukma Districts, branding them as ‘Police informers’ (incidents mentioned above). Moreover, the early data for 2023 suggests that SF dominance on the ground, purely in terms of the kill ratio, has weakened during the first three months of 2023, as compared to the whole of 2022 and earlier. Not surprisingly, civilian insecurity has escalated. Disturbingly, more than a few deficits in the fighting forces remained noticeable in some of the worst Maoist-afflicted States, according to the _Bureau of Police Research & Development_ (BPR&D) data. BPR&D disclosed, as on January 1, 2021, that there were at least 28 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst affected State, that had no telephone. In Jharkhand, 47 had no vehicle, 211 had no telephone, and 31 had no wireless/mobile connectivity. In Andhra Pradesh, 65 Police Stations had no vehicle, and 34 had no wireless/mobile connectivity; and in Odisha, four had no vehicle, and three had no telephone. Moreover, large vacancies persist in the State Police Forces. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2021, against the sanctioned strength of 1,109,260 there were a total of 838,481 policemen in position in 10 LWE-affected States, leaving a vacancy of 270,779, i.e., 24.41 per cent. At the national level, deficits against sanctioned strength were 20.34 per cent, almost the same as the shortage in the Maoist affected States. The police-population ratio (policemen per hundred thousand population) of these 12 States had increased from an average of 138.63 in 2018 to 149.42 in 2019. Meanwhile, the all-India police-population ratio had increased from 150.80 in 2018 to 158.22 in 2019, significantly higher than the levels in the LWE affected States. Importantly, existing police-population ratios in these 12 states remained significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 183.97. At the national level, the existing levels were also significantly lower than the sanctioned strength of 198.65 per 100,000. Moreover, the number of vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) of these 12 States was 595 (22.44 per cent), as against 948 (19.97 per cent) at the national level, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. These critical deficiencies in the enforcement apparatuses need urgent attention if the gains against the Maoists are to be consolidated further. The Maoists are down, but yet not out. The overall declining trend in Maoist violence and activity across the country needs to be contained with further security interventions with a sense of urgency, as the Maoists have shown incredible capacities for resurrection in the past, and retain substantial operational and overground capabilities in significant areas of their erstwhile regions of dominance. The SFs will have to overcome prevailing operational and capacity deficits, to prevent any rebel resurgence. | [Assessments Year

It provides projections for the global economy following the severe downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as analysis of economic challenges and policy considerations. The report expects only a partial recovery in 2021 and estimates that the damage to supply potential could lower medium-term growth. It also discusses risks to the outlook, including the possibility of more severe downturns, and recommends near-term policy priorities of ensuring health resources and limiting economic damage, along with enhanced multilateral cooperation and policies to address long-term challenges.

It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July 24 to August 21, 2020, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $41.69 a barrel in 2020 and $46.70 a barrel in 2021 and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on US dollar deposits will average 0.7 percent in 2020 and 0.4 percent in 2021; that the three-month euro deposit rate will average –0.4 percent in 2020 and –0.5 percent in 2021; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield, on average, 0.0 percent in 2020 and 2021. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through September 28, 2020. The following conventions are used throughout the WEO: . . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable; – between years or months (for example, 2019–20 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months; and / between years or months (for example, 2019/20) to indicate a fiscal or financial year. “Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion. “Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of 1 percentage point). Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and government finance data for each country. For some countries, the figures for 2019 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments indicators for each country. What is new in this publication: • Following the recent release of the 2017 International Comparison Program (ICP) survey for new purchasing- power-parity benchmarks, the WEO’s estimates of purchasing-power-parity weights and GDP valued at purchasing power parity have been updated. For more details, see Box 1.1 in the October 2020 WEO at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2020/02/index.htm. • Starting with the October 2020 WEO, data and forecasts for Bangladesh and Tonga are presented on a fiscal year basis. • Data for West Bank and Gaza are now included in the WEO. West Bank and Gaza is added to the Middle East and Central Asia regional group. In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply: • If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database. • When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size. • Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-9-2048.jpg) ![Assumptions and Conventions International Monetary Fund|October 2020 ix As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger com- pilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages. The data appearing in the WEO are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The histori- cal data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and structural breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques. IMF staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable. As a result, WEO data can differ from those in other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure their timeliness, accuracy, and completeness, but these cannot be guaranteed. When errors are discovered, there is a concerted effort to correct them as appropriate and feasible.

The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department— together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and the Fiscal Affairs Department. The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Gita Gopinath, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Gian Maria Milesi-­Ferretti, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Malhar Nabar, Division Chief, Research Department; Oya Celasun, Division Chief, Research Department directed Chapter 3.

Joseph Procopio from the Communications Department led the editorial team for the report, with production and editorial support from Christine Ebrahimzadeh, and editorial assistance from Lucy Scott Morales, James Unwin, Harold Medina (and team), and Vector Talent Resources. The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff members from other IMF departments, as well as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on September 30, 2020. However, both projections and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive Directors or to their national authorities. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-13-2048.jpg) ![International Monetary Fund|October 2020 xiii M ore than one million lives have been lost to COVID-19 since the start of the year and the toll continues to rise. Many more have suffered serious illness. Close to 90 million people are expected to fall into extreme deprivation this year. These are difficult times, yet there are some reasons to be hopeful. Testing has been ramped up, treatments are improving, and vaccine trials have proceeded at an unprecedented pace, with some now in the final stage of testing. International solidarity has strength- ened along some dimensions, from rolling back trade restrictions on medical equipment to enhancing finan- cial assistance for vulnerable countries. And recent data suggest that many economies have started to recover at a faster pace than anticipated after reopen- ing from the Great Lockdown. We are projecting a somewhat less severe though still deep recession in 2020, relative to our June fore- cast. The revision is driven by second quarter GDP outturns in large advanced economies, which were not as negative as we had projected; China’s return to growth, which was stronger than expected; and signs of a more rapid recovery in the third quarter. Outturns would have been much weaker if it weren’t for sizable, swift, and unprecedented fiscal, monetary, and regulatory responses that maintained dispos- able income for households, protected cash flow for firms, and supported credit provision. Collectively these actions have so far prevented a recurrence of the financial catastrophe of 2008-09. While the global economy is coming back, the ascent will likely be long, uneven, and uncertain. Indeed, compared to our forecast in June, prospects have worsened significantly in some emerging market and developing economies where infections are rising rapidly. Consequently, emerging market and devel- oping economies, excluding China, are projected to incur a greater loss of output over 2020-21 relative to the pre-pandemic projected path when compared to advanced economies. These uneven recoveries signifi- cantly worsen the prospects for global convergence in income levels. Moreover, recovery is not assured while the pan- demic continues to spread. With renewed upticks in COVID-19 infections in places that had reduced local transmission to low levels, re-openings have paused, and targeted shutdowns are being reinstated. Economies everywhere face difficult paths back to pre- pandemic activity levels. Preventing further setbacks will require that policy support is not prematurely withdrawn. The path ahead will require skillful domestic policies that man- age trade-offs between lifting near-term activity and addressing medium-term challenges. The October 2020 Global Financial Stability Report highlights such trade-offs for monetary policy. Sustaining the recov- ery will also require strong international cooperation on health and financial support for countries facing liquidity shortfalls. Finding the right policy mix is daunting, but the experience of the past few months provides grounds for cautious optimism that the pri- orities laid out in this report can be achieved. A key aspect of combating the health crisis is to ensure that all innovations, be they in testing, treat- ments, or vaccines, are produced at scale for the benefit of all countries. Advance purchase commit- ments for vaccines under trial can help spur this process for manufacturers who may otherwise hesitate to bear the upfront cost. This effort should include a strong multilateral component to help distribute doses to all countries at affordable prices. More generally, the global community will need to continue helping countries with limited health care capacity through sharing equipment, know-how, and through financial support from international health agencies. At the national level, governments have already responded with a variety of fiscal countermeasures that include efforts to cushion income losses, incentivize hiring, expand social assistance, guarantee credit, and inject equity into firms. These measures have pre- vented widespread firm bankruptcies and have helped employment rebound partially. Employment and labor force participation, however, remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and many more millions of jobs are at risk the longer this crisis continues. To preserve FOREWORD ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-14-2048.jpg) ![jobs, it is important for governments, where possible, to continue to support viable but still vulnerable firms with moratoria on debt service and equity-like support. Over time, once the recovery has taken a strong hold, policies should shift gradually to facili- tating reallocation of workers from sectors likely to shrink on a long-term basis (travel) to growing sectors (e-commerce). Along the transition, workers will need to be supported, including through income transfers, retraining, and reskilling programs. Advanced economies have generally been able to deliver larger direct spending and liquidity support rela- tive to GDP than others constrained by elevated debt and higher borrowing costs. Those constrained coun- tries will need to create room for immediate spend- ing needs by prioritizing crisis countermeasures and reducing poorly targeted subsidies. Some will require additional help from creditors and donors through debt restructuring, grants, and concessional financing, building on important initiatives under way. The IMF has been central to these initiatives through its joint call with the World Bank on debt service suspension for low-income countries, its call for reform of the interna- tional debt architecture, and its extension of funding at unprecedented speed to several member countries. Further complicating the task that countries face is the need to address challenges coming out of the pandemic. In this report we are releasing medium- term growth projections for the first time since the crisis started. While uncertainty remains substantial, growth is expected to moderate significantly, follow- ing the projected rebound in global activity in 2021. Both advanced and emerging market economies are likely to register significant losses of output relative to their pre-pandemic forecasts. Small states as well as tourism-dependent and commodities-based economies are in a particularly difficult spot. Most economies will experience lasting damage to supply potential, reflecting scars from the deep recession this year and the need for structural change. The persistent output losses imply a major setback to living standards relative to what was expected before the pandemic. Not only will the incidence of extreme poverty rise for the first time in over two decades, but inequality is set to increase because the crisis has disproportionately affected women, the informally employed, and those with relatively lower educational attainment, as discussed in Chapter 2 of this report. The loss of human capital accumulation after wide- spread school closures poses an additional challenge. Moreover, sovereign debt levels are set to increase significantly even as downgrades to potential output imply a smaller tax base that makes it harder to ser- vice the debt. On the plus side, the prospects of low interest rates over a longer period, alongside the pro- jected rebound in growth in 2021, can help alleviate debt service burdens in many countries. To ensure that debt remains on a sustainable path over the medium-term governments may need to increase the progressivity of their taxes and ensure that corpora- tions pay their fair share of taxes while eliminating wasteful spending. Near-term support policies should be designed with a view toward placing economies on paths of stronger, equitable, and sustainable growth. As discussed in Chapter 3 of this report, policymakers can simultaneously aim to mitigate climate change and bolster the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. This can be achieved through a comprehensive pack- age that includes a sizable green public infrastructure push, a gradual rise in carbon prices, and compen- sation for lower income households to make the transition fair. More generally, expanding the safety net where gaps exist can ensure the most vulnerable are protected while supporting near-term activity, as already seen, for example, in many advanced econo- mies where disposable income remained relatively stable even as GDP registered record collapses. And investments in health and education (including to remedy losses incurred during the pandemic) can help achieve participatory and inclusive growth. The October 2020 Fiscal Monitor makes a strong case for public investment in these times of heightened uncertainty. We have already had significant policy innova- tions in the past few months: the establishment of the European Union pandemic recovery package fund, the launch of asset purchases by emerging market central banks, and the novel use of digital technologies to deliver social assistance in places like sub-Saharan Africa. Such actions have prevented even more extreme collapses and are a powerful reminder that effective, well-designed policies protect people and collective economic well-being. Building on these actions, policies for the next stage of the crisis must seek lasting improvements in the global economy that create secure, prosperous futures for all.

But with the COVID-19 pan- demic continuing to spread, many countries have slowed reopening and some are reinstating partial lockdowns to protect susceptible populations. While recovery in China has been faster than expected, the global economy’s long ascent back to pre-pandemic levels of activity remains prone to setbacks. Global Growth Outlook and Risks Near-term outlook. Global growth is projected at −4.4 percent in 2020, a less severe contraction than forecast in the June 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update. The revision reflects better-­than- anticipated second quarter GDP outturns, mostly in advanced economies, where activity began to improve sooner than expected after lockdowns were scaled back in May and June, as well as indicators of a stronger recovery in the third quarter. Global growth is pro- jected at 5.2 percent in 2021, a little lower than in the June 2020 WEO Update, reflecting the more moder- ate downturn projected for 2020 and consistent with expectations of persistent social distancing. Following the contraction in 2020 and recovery in 2021, the level of global GDP in 2021 is expected to be a mod- est 0.6 percent above that of 2019. The growth pro- jections imply wide negative output gaps and elevated unemployment rates this year and in 2021 across both advanced and emerging market economies. Medium-term outlook. After the rebound in 2021, global growth is expected to gradually slow to about 3.5 percent into the medium term. This implies only limited progress toward catching up to the path of economic activity for 2020–25 projected before the pandemic for both advanced and emerging market and developing economies. It is also a severe setback to the projected improvement in average living standards across all country groups. The pandemic will reverse the progress made since the 1990s in reducing global poverty and will increase inequality. People who rely on daily wage labor and are outside the formal safety net faced sudden income losses when mobility restrictions were imposed. Among them, migrant workers who live far from home had even less recourse to traditional support networks. Close to 90 million people could fall below the $1.90 a day income threshold of extreme deprivation this year. In addition, school closures dur- ing the pandemic pose a significant new challenge that could set back human capital accumulation severely. The subdued outlook for medium-term growth comes with a significant projected increase in the stock of sovereign debt. Downward revisions to potential output also imply a smaller tax base over the medium term than previously envisaged, compound- ing difficulties in servicing debt obligations. The baseline projection assumes that social distancing will continue into 2021 but will subsequently fade over time as vaccine coverage expands and therapies improve. Local transmission is assumed to be brought to low lev- els everywhere by the end of 2022. The medium-term projections also assume that economies will experi- ence scarring from the depth of the recession and the need for structural change, entailing persistent effects on potential output. These effects include adjustment costs and productivity impacts for surviving firms as they upgrade workplace safety, the amplification of the shock via firm bankruptcies, costly resource reallocation across sectors, and discouraged workers’ exit from the workforce. The scarring is expected to compound forces that dragged productivity growth lower across many economies in the years leading up to the pandemic— relatively slow investment growth weighing on physical capital accumulation, more modest improvements in human capital, and slower efficiency gains in combining technology with factors of production. Risks. The uncertainty surrounding the baseline projection is unusually large. The forecast rests on public health and economic factors that are inherently difficult to predict. A first layer relates to the path of the pandemic, the needed public health response, and the associated domestic activity disruptions, most notably for contact-intensive sectors. Another source of uncertainty is the extent of global spillovers from soft demand, weaker tourism, and lower remittances. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-16-2048.jpg) ![A third set of factors comprises financial market senti- ment and its implications for global capital flows. Moreover, there is uncertainty surrounding the damage to supply potential—which will depend on the per- sistence of the pandemic shock, the size and effective- ness of the policy response, and the extent of sectoral resource mismatches. Progress with vaccines and treatments, as well as changes in the workplace and by consumers to reduce transmission, may allow activity to return more rap- idly to pre-pandemic levels than currently projected, without triggering repeated waves of infection. And an extension of fiscal countermeasures into 2021 could also lift growth above the forecast, which factors in only the measures implemented and announced so far. However, the risk of worse growth outcomes than projected remains sizable. If the virus resurges, progress on treatments and vaccines is slower than anticipated, or countries’ access to them remains unequal, eco- nomic activity could be lower than expected, with renewed social distancing and tighter lockdowns. Con- sidering the severity of the recession and the possible withdrawal of emergency support in some countries, rising bankruptcies could compound job and income losses. Deteriorating financial sentiment could trigger a sudden stop in new lending (or failure to roll over existing debt) to vulnerable economies. And cross-­ border spillovers from weaker external demand could amplify the impact of country-specific shocks. Policy Priorities: Near-Term Imperatives, Medium-Term Challenges Besides combating the deep near-term recession, policymakers have to address complex challenges to place economies on a path of higher productivity growth while ensuring that gains are shared evenly and debt remains sustainable. Many countries already face difficult trade-offs between implementing measures to support near-term growth and avoiding a further buildup of debt that will be hard to service down the road, considering the crisis’s hit to potential output. Policies to support the economy in the near term should therefore be designed with an eye to guiding economies to paths of stronger, equitable, and resilient growth. Tax and spending measures should privilege initiatives that can help lift potential output, ensure participatory growth that benefits all, and protect the vulnerable. The additional debt incurred to finance such endeavors is more likely to pay for itself down the road by increasing the size of the economy and future tax base than if the borrowing were done to finance ill-targeted subsidies or wasteful current spending. Investments in health, education, and high-return infrastructure projects that also help move the economy to lower carbon depen- dence can further those objectives. Research spending can facilitate innovation and technology adoption—the principal drivers of long-term productivity growth. Moreover, safeguarding critical social spending can ensure that the most vulnerable are protected while also supporting near-term activity, given that the outlays will go to groups with a higher propensity to spend their disposable income than more affluent individuals. In all instances, adhering to the highest standards of debt transparency will be essential to avoid future rollover difficulties and higher sovereign risk premiums that raise borrowing costs across the economy. Given the global nature of the shock and common challenges across countries, strong multilateral efforts are needed to fight the health and economic crisis. A key priority is funding advance purchase commitments at the global level for vaccines currently under trial to incentivize rapid scaling up of production and world- wide distribution of affordable doses (for example, by bolstering multilateral initiatives for vaccine develop- ment and manufacture, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance). This is particularly important given the uncertainty and risk of failure in the search for effective and safe vaccines. A related priority is to help countries with limited health care capacity. Beyond assistance with medical equipment and know-how, several emerging market and developing economies—in particular low-income countries—require support from the international community through debt relief, grants, and concessional financing. Where debt restructuring is needed, creditors and low-income-coun- try and emerging market borrowers should quickly agree on mutually acceptable terms. The global financial safety net can further help countries deal with external fund- ing shortfalls. Since the onset of the crisis, the IMF has expeditiously provided funding from its various lending facilities to about 80 countries at unprecedented speed. For many countries, sustaining economic activity and helping individuals and firms most in need—while ensuring that debt remains sustainable—is a daunt- ing task, given high public debt, the spending needs triggered by the crisis, and the hit to public revenues. Governments should do all that they can to combat the health crisis and mitigate the deep downturn while WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A LONG AND DIFFICULT ASCENT xvi International Monetary Fund|October 2020 ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-17-2048.jpg) ![being ready to adjust policy strategy as the pandemic and its impact on activity evolve. Where fiscal rules may constrain action, their temporary suspension would be warranted, combined with a commit- ment to a gradual consolidation path after the crisis abates to restore compliance with the rules over the medium term. Room for immediate spending needs could be created by prioritizing crisis countermeasures and reducing wasteful and poorly targeted subsidies. Extending maturities on public debt and locking in low interest rates to the extent possible would help reduce debt service and free up resources to be redirected toward crisis mitigation efforts. Although adopting new revenue measures during the crisis will be difficult, governments may need to consider raising progressive taxes on more affluent individuals and those relatively less affected by the crisis (including increasing tax rates on higher income brackets, high-end property, capital gains, and wealth) as well as changes to corporate taxa- tion that ensure firms pay taxes commensurate with profitability. Countries should also cooperate on the design of international corporate taxation to respond to the challenges of the digital economy. With the pandemic continuing to spread, all countries—­including those where infections appear to have peaked—need to ensure that their health care systems can cope with elevated demand. This means securing adequate resources and prioritizing health care spending as needed, including on testing; contact tracing; personal protective equipment; life-­saving equipment, such as ventilators; and facilities, such as emergency rooms, intensive care units, and isolation wards. Countries where infections continue to rise need to contain the pandemic with mitigation measures that slow transmission. As Chapter 2 shows, lock- downs are effective in bringing down infections. Mitigation measures—a much-needed investment in public health—set the stage for an eventual economic recovery from the downturn brought on by mobility constraints. Economic policy in such cases should limit the damage by cushioning income losses for affected people and firms while also supporting resource real- location away from contact-intensive sectors that are likely to be constrained for an extended period of time. Retraining and reskilling should be pursued to the extent feasible so that workers can look for jobs in other sectors. Because the transition may take a while, displaced workers will need extended income support as they retrain and search for jobs. Complementing such measures, broad-based accommodative monetary and fiscal responses—where fiscal space exists—can help prevent deeper and longer-­lasting downturns, even if their ability to stimulate spending is initially hampered by mobility restrictions. As countries reopen, policies must support the recovery by gradually removing targeted support, facilitating the reallocation of workers and resources to sectors less affected by social distancing, and providing stimulus where needed to the extent possible. Some fiscal resources freed from targeted support should be redeployed to public investment—including in renewable energy, improving the efficiency of power transmission, and retrofitting buildings to reduce their carbon footprint. Moreover, as lifelines are unwound, social spending should be expanded to protect the most vulnerable where gaps exist in the safety net. In those cases, authorities could enhance paid family and sick leave, expand eligibility for unemployment insurance, and strengthen health care benefit coverage as needed. Where inflation expectations are anchored, accommodative monetary policy can help during the transition by containing borrowing costs. Beyond the pandemic, multilateral cooperation is needed to defuse trade and technology tensions between countries and address gaps—for instance in services trade—in the rules-based multilateral trading system. Countries must also act collectively to implement their climate change mitigation commitments. As discussed in Chapter 3, joint action—particularly by the largest emit- ters—that combines steadily rising carbon prices with a green investment push is needed to reduce emissions consistent with limiting increases in global temperature to the targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement. A broadly adopted, growth-friendly mitigation package could raise global activity through investment in green infrastructure over the near term, with modest output costs over the medium term as economies transition away from fossil fuels toward cleaner technologies. Relative to unchanged policies, such a package would significantly boost incomes in the second half of the century by avoiding damages and catastrophic risks from climate change. Moreover, health outcomes would begin to improve immediately in many countries thanks to reduced local air pollution. The global community should also take urgent steps to strengthen its defenses against calamitous health crises, for example by augmenting stockpiles of protective equipment and essential medical supplies, financing research, and ensuring adequate ongoing assistance to countries with limited health care capacity, including through support of international organizations.

During May and June, as many economies tentatively reopened from the Great Lockdown, the global economy started to climb from the depths to which it had plunged in April. But with the pandemic spreading and accelerating in places, many countries slowed reopening, and some are reinstating partial lockdowns. While the swift recov- ery in China has surprised on the upside, the global economy’s long ascent back to pre-pandemic levels of activity remains prone to setbacks. •• Activity picked up in May and June as economies reopened. The strengthening from the trough in April was most evident, not surprisingly, in retail sales, where discretionary consumer spending rose with reopening (Figure 1.1). Firms, however, remained cautious in responding to this revival: industrial production in many countries is still well below December levels. •• Second quarter GDP outturns, on balance, deliv- ered positive surprises. As economies reopened and released constraints on spending, overall activity normalized faster than anticipated in the June 2020 WEO Update. GDP outturns for the second quarter surprised on the upside in China (where, after lockdowns eased in early April, public investment helped boost activity to return to positive growth in the second quarter) and the United States and euro area (where both economies contracted at a historic pace in the second quarter, but less severely than projected, with government transfers support- ing household incomes). The news, however, was not uniformly positive. Second quarter GDP was weaker than projected, for instance, where domestic demand plunged following a very sharp compres- sion in consumption and a collapse in investment (such as in India), where the pandemic continued to spread (such as in Mexico), where soft external demand weighed particularly heavily on exporting sectors (for example, in Korea), and where signif- icant weakening of remittance flows weighed on domestic spending (for example, in the Philippines). •• Global trade began recovering in June as lockdowns were eased (Figure 1.2). China is an important contributor. Its exports recovered from deep declines earlier in the year, supported by an earlier restart of activity and a strong pickup in external demand for medical equipment and for equipment to support the shift to remote working. •• The pandemic continues to spread. By late September, the number of confirmed infections worldwide exceeded 33 million, with over a million deaths— up from more than 7 million infections and 400,000 deaths at the time of the June 2020 WEO Update. Confirmed cases rose dramatically in the United States, Latin America, India, and South Africa. Moreover, there were renewed upticks in places that had previously flattened the infection curve: Australia, Japan, Spain, and France. •• Reopening has stalled. Confronting renewed upticks, countries slowed their reopening during August and reinstated partial lockdowns in some cases (Figure 1.3). The deep wounds to the global economy from the pandemic recession are further evident in labor market indicators and inflation outcomes. •• Labor market. According to the International Labour Organization, the global reduction in work hours in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 was equivalent to the loss of 400 million full-time jobs, deepening from equiv- alent 155 million full-time jobs lost in the first quarter. Women in the labor force, particularly those informally employed, have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and lockdowns needed to slow the spread of the virus: the International Labour Organization estimates that 42 percent of informally employed women work in severely affected sectors of the economy, compared with about 32 percent of men in informal employment. Consistent with the pattern for global activity GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES1 CHAPTER ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-20-2048.jpg) ![2 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent International Monetary Fund | October 2020 and trade, employment and labor force indicators have improved since May. For example, the unem- ployment rate fell substantially and job creation increased in the United States, applications to Germany’s Kurzarbeit reduced-hours work program slowed sharply in May and continued declining steadily throughout August, and female labor force participation had partially recovered in Japan as of July after close to 1 million women left the labor force from January to April. •• Inflation. While prices of such items as medical supplies increased and commodity prices lifted from their April trough (Commodities Special Feature; Figure 1.4), the effects of weak aggregate demand appear to have outweighed the impact of supply interruptions.1 In sequential terms, inflation in 1The assessment is subject to an important caveat. The basket of goods and services used to measure consumer price inflation may not be representative of actual consumption patterns during the pan- demic and may underestimate the true increase in the cost of living. advanced economies remains below pre-pandemic levels (Figure 1.5). In emerging market and develop- ing economies inflation declined sharply in the initial stages of the pandemic, although it has since picked up in some countries (India, for example, reflecting supply disruptions and a rise in food prices). A unique recession. The downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has been very different from past recessions. In previous downturns, service-oriented sectors have tended to suffer smaller growth declines than manufacturing. In the current crisis, the public health response needed to slow transmission, together with behavioral changes, has meant that service sectors reliant on face-to-face interactions—particularly wholesale and retail trade, hospitality, and arts and entertainment—have seen larger contractions than manufacturing (Figure 1.6). The scale of disruption indicates that, without a vaccine and effective therapies to combat the virus, such sectors face a particularly difficult path back to any semblance of normalcy.

For September, these indicators point to stronger activity in manufacturing but some setback for services, most likely reflecting the increase in infections.

New policy initiatives have also helped lift sentiment. Beyond their sheer scale, the novelty of the policy actions has also supported sentiment. Prominent examples of new initiatives include the €750 billion European Union pandemic recovery package–fund (more than half of it grant-based) and a wide range of temporary lifeline policies worldwide. The latter have included cash and in-kind transfers to affected firms and households; wage subsidies to maintain employment; expanded unemployment insurance coverage; tax deferrals; and regulatory initiatives to ease classification rules and provisioning requirements for banks’ nonper- forming loans, together with the release of buffers to help absorb losses. Central bank actions in advanced economies have involved more diverse, larger scales of asset purchases and relending facilities, supporting credit provision to a wide range of borrowers. The Federal Reserve also announced changes in its monetary policy strategy, moving to a flexible average inflation target of 2 percent over time. Emerging market central banks’ responses combined interest rate cuts, new relending facilities, and, for the first time in many cases, asset purchases (see Chapter 2 of the October 2020 Global Financial Stability Report [GFSR]). Financial conditions have generally continued to ease. These aggressive policy countermeasures have played a vital role in supporting sentiment and preventing fur- ther amplification of the COVID-19 shock through the financial system. Financial conditions have eased since June for advanced economies and for most emerging market and developing economies, implying a continu- ing disconnect between financial markets and the real economy that partly reflects the unprecedented policy support (as discussed in the October 2020 GFSR). •• Equity markets in advanced economies have mostly regained (and in some cases exceeded) their levels from the start of the year, sovereign bond yields are broadly unchanged or have declined further since June (as seen in Italy since the European Union’s pandemic recovery package was established and the European Central Bank’s pandemic emergency purchase program was expanded), and corporate spreads have dropped further, particularly for high- yield credit (benefiting, in the United States, from the Federal Reserve’s targeted lending facilities), as shown in Figure 1.8.

Spreads over US Treasury securities, which had begun falling after the Fed- eral Reserve’s aggressive actions in March to offset tighter financial conditions and dollar liquidity shortages, have continued to compress since June in line with stronger risk appetite (Figure 1.9). Equity markets in emerging market and developing economies have also generally firmed up since June (notably in China). Steps to support dollar liquidity (such as central bank swap lines), together with the recovery under way in China, have helped rekindle portfolio flows to some emerging markets after the sharp reversal in March (Figure 1.10). Nonetheless, as noted in the October 2020 GFSR, the recovery in portfolio flows is uneven, with some countries continuing to experience large outflows. •• Among major currencies, the dollar depreciated by over 4 ½ percent in real effective terms between April and late September, reflecting improving global risk sentiment and concerns about the impact of ris- ing COVID-19 cases on the speed of the US recov- ery. During the same period, the euro appreciated by close to 4 percent on improving economic prospects and slower increases in COVID-19 cases. The currencies of commodity exporters among advanced economies strengthened as commodity prices firmed. Most emerging market currencies recovered between April and June, after the severe pressures during the market turmoil in March. Since then the Chinese renminbi has strengthened and the currencies of other Asian emerging market economies have generally remained stable in real effective terms. In contrast, the Russian ruble depreciated on geopolit- ical factors and the currencies of countries severely affected by the pandemic or with a vulnerable exter- nal or fiscal position (such as Argentina, Brazil, and Turkey) have also weakened (Figure 1.11). Considerations for the Forecast Fundamental uncertainty regarding the pandemic and associated factors. The full extent of the contraction in the second quarter of 2020 has become clearer since the June 2020 WEO Update, providing a more informed basis for the near-term forecast.

The baseline forecast rests on the following consider- ations and assumptions: •• Stronger-than-anticipated GDP outturns in the second quarter. The developments discussed in the previous section suggest that the worst may be over for now, but nothing is assured while the pandemic worsens and stalls reopening. A slightly less severe hit to activity than previously projected for the second quarter implies an upward revision to the 2020 fore- cast. But other considerations weigh on the forecast for 2021 and beyond.

The baseline projection assumes that social distancing will continue into 2021 but will then fade over time as vaccine coverage expands and therapies improve, with local transmission brought to low levels everywhere by the end of 2022. Vac- cine trials have progressed at an unprecedented rate, and some have reached the final testing phase prior to approval or rejection. Nonetheless, even after approval, vaccine coverage is likely to expand only gradually as it will take time to scale up production and distribute adequate doses worldwide at afford- able prices. In countries where infection rates appear to have gone past their peak, persistent behavioral changes, together with enhanced workplace hygiene and safety standards, are assumed to keep new infections at a level that allows health care systems to cope with the caseload and without requiring a return to economy-wide lockdowns. For other coun- tries where infections are still rising, the baseline also assumes the possibility of renewed lockdowns for particular zones, even if stringent nationwide shutdowns are not repeated. •• Scarring. As in the WEO forecasts in April and June, the baseline also assumes that the deep downturn this year will damage supply potential to varying degrees across economies. The impact will depend on various factors discussed in the section on the medium-term growth outlook, including the extent of firm closures, exit of discouraged workers from the labor force, and resource mismatches (sectoral, occupational, and geographic). •• Policy support and financial conditions. Fiscal policy settings in the baseline reflect the $6 trillion direct tax and spending measures announced and imple- mented worldwide so far in response to the crisis (see the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor). Major central banks are assumed to maintain their current settings throughout the forecast horizon to the end of 2025. The baseline forecast is consistent with financial conditions remaining broadly at current levels. •• Commodity prices. Average petroleum spot prices per barrel are projected at $41 in 2020 and $43.8 in 2021, higher than in the April and June forecasts. Oil futures curves indicate that prices are expected to rise thereafter toward $48, some 25 percent below the 2019 average. Nonfuel commodity prices are expected to rise faster than assumed in April and June. Partial Recovery from Deep Recession Expected in 2021 Global growth is projected at –4.4 percent in 2020, 0.8 percentage point above the June 2020 WEO Update forecast (Table 1.1). The stronger projection for 2020 compared with the June 2020 WEO Update reflects the net effect of two competing factors: the upward impetus from better-than-anticipated second quarter GDP outturns (mostly in advanced economies) versus the downdraft from persistent social distancing and stalled reopenings in the second half of the year. As explained in Box 1.1, the global growth forecast and the forecast for regional aggregates in Table 1.1 use an updated set of purchasing-power-parity weights for individual economies following the release of the 2017 survey of the International Comparison Program.2 As discussed, a recovery has taken root in the third quarter of 2020. It is expected to strengthen gradually over 2021. The recovery is likely to be characterized by persistent social distancing until health risks are addressed (as discussed in Chapter 2)—and countries may have to again tighten mitigation measures depending on the spread of the virus (see also Online Annex 1.2 of the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor). Global growth is projected at 5.2 percent in 2021, 0.2 per- centage point lower than in the June 2020 WEO Update. The projected 2021 rebound following the deep 2020 downturn implies a small expected increase in global GDP over 2020–21 of 0.6 percentage point relative to 2019. Growth in the advanced economy group is projected at –5.8 percent in 2020, 2.3 percentage points stronger than in the June 2020 WEO Update. The upward revision reflects, in particular, the better-than-­foreseen US and euro area GDP outturns in the second quarter. In 2021 the advanced economy growth rate is pro- jected to strengthen to 3.9 percent, leaving 2021 GDP for the group some 2 percent below what it was in 2019. The US economy is projected to contract by 4.3 percent, before growing at 3.1 percent in 2021. A deeper contraction of 8.3 percent is projected for 2The main shift in global weights compared with the previous set is an increase of 3 percentage points in the relative weight of advanced economies (from 40 percent to 43 percent for 2019), offset by a reduction in the relative weight of emerging market and developing economies, most notably China and India. Because the new set increases the weight attached to slower-growing advanced economies, the aggregation of the June 2020 WEO Update country forecasts with the new purchasing-power-parity weights yields a slightly lower projection for world growth in 2020 (–5.2 percent) than the one shown in June (–4.9 percent). ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-27-2048.jpg) ![9 CHAPTER 1 GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES International Monetary Fund | October 2020 Table 1.1.

The growth bounce-back of 5.2 percent projected for 2021 is accordingly stronger from a lower base. Asian advanced economies are projected to have somewhat more moderate downturns than those of Europe, in light of the more contained pandemic, also reflected in smaller GDP declines during the first half of 2020. Among emerging market and developing economies, growth is forecast at –3.3 percent in 2020, 0.2 percent- age point weaker than in the June 2020 WEO Update, strengthening to 6 percent in 2021. Prospects for China are much stronger than for most other countries in this group, with the economy projected to grow by about 10 percent over 2020–21 (1.9 percent this year and 8.2 percent next year). Activity normalized faster than expected after most of the country reopened in early April, and second quarter GDP registered a positive surprise on the back of strong policy support and resilient exports. For many emerging market and developing economies excluding China, prospects continue to remain precari- ous. This reflects a combination of factors: the continu- ing spread of the pandemic and overwhelmed health care systems; the greater importance of severely affected sectors, such as tourism; and the greater dependence on external finance, including remittances. All emerging market and developing economy regions are expected to contract this year, including notably emerging Asia, where large economies, such as India and Indonesia, continue to try to bring the pandemic under control. Revisions to the forecast are particularly large for India, where GDP contracted much more severely than expected in the second quarter. As a result, the econ- omy is projected to contract by 10.3 percent in 2020, before rebounding by 8.8 percent in 2021. Regional differences remain stark, with many countries in Latin America severely affected by the pandemic facing very deep downturns, and large output declines expected for many countries in the Middle East and Central Asia region and oil-exporting countries in sub-Saharan Africa affected by low oil prices, civil strife, or economic crises. Growth for emerging market and developing economies excluding China is projected at –5.7 percent for 2020 and 5 percent for 2021. The projected rebound in 2021 is not sufficient to regain the 2019 level of activity by next year. Growth among low-income developing coun- tries is projected at –1.2 percent in 2020, strengthening to 4.9 percent in 2021. Higher population growth and low starting levels of income imply that even this more modest contraction compared with most emerging market economies will take a very heavy toll on living standards, especially for the poor (Box 1.2). Table 1.2 provides alternative projections for global and key group aggregate growth rates using GDP at market exchange rates as weights.3 The market exchange rate weights allocate significantly higher global GDP shares to slower-growing advanced econ- omies than the purchasing-power-parity weights used in Table 1.1. Because of the difference in weights the global growth projection (–4.7 percent for 2020 and 4.8 percent for 2021) is lower than in Table 1.1. 3Specifically, the projections use a three-year trailing moving average of nominal US dollar GDP as weights.

The growth projections imply wide negative output gaps this year and in 2021 as well as elevated unemployment rates across both advanced and emerging market economies (Annex Tables 1.1.1 to 1.1.5). Including those in reduced-hours work programs and those counted in involuntary part-time employ- ment, the share of workers underemployed in some advanced economies is significantly higher than the frac- tion of headline unemployed. Labor market data are less comprehensive for emerging market economies. None- theless, based on surveys and available official estimates, unemployment rates in several emerging market econo- mies are projected to increase significantly this year. Medium-Term Growth Reflects Damage to Supply Potential After the rebound in 2021, the baseline forecast for the global economy envisages growth to slow to about 3.5 percent into the medium term. This implies that both advanced and emerging market and developing economies will only modestly progress toward the 2020–25 path of economic activity projected before the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1.12), pointing to a severe setback to the projected pace of improve- ment in average living standards across all country groups (Figure 1.13). Medium-term projections incorporate the expected impact of the COVID-19 shock on supply potential. As noted, the projections rely on economies adapting and operating in ways compatible with social distancing for the initial forecast years and being affected by scar- ring (including through bankruptcies, lower labor force participation, and obstacles to resource reallocation). This may entail large structural change, including redeploying resources away from sectors where activity will be constrained by distancing, workplace changes to raise safety standards, and the adoption of new technologies that support remote working.

Among the 10 largest advanced economies, potential GDP in the medium term is expected, on average, to remain 3.5 percent below what had been projected in the January 2020 WEO (pre-pandemic) forecast. Among the 10 largest emerging markets, the decline is even larger, at 5.5 percent, on average. In the advanced economy group, growth is expected to slow to 1.7 percent over the medium term. Beyond the impact of the pandemic on potential growth, the macroeconomic effects of demographic change (aging and slower population growth) weigh on the medium-term forecast for the group. Among emerging market and developing economies, growth is projected to decline to 4.7 percent by 2025, well below the 5.6 percent average of 2000–19. Key fea- tures shaping the medium-term outlook for the group include the structural slowdown in China that preceded the pandemic and is expected to continue following the strong cyclical rebound in 2021; a subdued path for commodity prices; weak prospects for external demand related to the expected moderation in advanced econ- omy growth; and, for tourism-­dependent economies, persistently lower cross-border travel. Challenges to Debt Sustainability The subdued outlook for medium-term growth comes with a significant projected increase in the stock of sovereign debt—which was high to begin with. Downward revisions to potential output also imply a smaller tax base over the medium term than previously envisaged, compounding difficulties in servicing debt obligations. As discussed in the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor, sovereign debt to GDP in advanced economies is projected to rise by 20 percentage points to about 125 percent of GDP by the end of 2021. Over the same period, sovereign debt to GDP in emerging market and developing economies is projected to rise by more than 10 percentage points to about 65 percent of GDP. Although low interest rates are expected to contain debt service, this is a mitigating factor mostly for advanced economies with a large fraction of negative-­ yielding sovereign bonds. The ratio of sovereign debt service to tax revenue is anticipated to increase for several emerging markets and low-income countries (Figure 1.14). The high fraction of tax revenue absorbed by debt service will necessarily mean that there is less revenue left over for critical areas, including social spending needs. These needs will be elevated after the cri- sis period to address rising poverty, tackle growing inequality, and correct setbacks to human capital accumulation. Poverty, Inequality, and Setbacks to Human Capital Accumulation Poverty. The pandemic will reverse the progress made since the 1990s in reducing global poverty. People who rely on daily wage labor and are outside the formal safety net faced sudden income losses when mobil- ity restrictions were imposed. Among them, migrant 2019 2020 2021 Figure 1.14.

As a consequence, close to 90 million people could fall below the $1.90 a day income threshold of extreme deprivation this year (Box 1.2, October 2020 Fiscal Monitor, and WB 2020a). Inequality. As discussed in Chapter 2, the pandemic is having particularly adverse effects on economically more vulnerable people, including younger workers and women. The burden of the crisis has fallen unevenly across sectors. Differentiating jobs based on attributes that make them amenable to telework, workers most affected by the pandemic are employed in accommodation and food services, transportation, retail, and wholesale (Brussevich, Dabla-Norris, and Khalid 2020). Moreover, younger workers, those in less secure work arrangements, and those employed in small and medium enterprises appear more vulner- able to layoffs. In general, low-wage earners are at an appreciably higher risk of losing their jobs than those in upper quintiles of the wage distribution (see, for example, Shibata 2020 on the United States). Similar outcomes are seen in emerging market and developing economies, where informally employed workers are more likely to become unemployed than those with formal contracts (see, for example, Jain and others 2020 on South Africa). Such developments will exacerbate preexisting trends. Entering the crisis, income inequality had risen significantly compared with the early 1990s in many advanced economies and among some fast-growing emerging market and developing economies (Figure 1.15; also see Annex 1.1 of the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor). These developments reflect a combi- nation of factors, including skill-biased technological change that favored those with high educational attainment, the decline of unions, the increase in firms’ monopsony power in the labor market because of rising market concentration and the associated decrease in the bargaining power of employees, and regressive tax policy changes that have resulted in lower marginal taxes on the highest earners as well as lower corporate taxes over the past several years. Human Capital Accumulation. An additional aspect, with bearing on the current labor market outcomes of parents and prospects for their children, follows from the extensive school closures during the pandemic. UNESCO (2020) estimates that more than 1.6 billion learners worldwide have been affected by school and university closures. Gaps in childcare limit parents’ ability to work, particularly that of mothers (see Chapter 2). For children, schooling interruptions reduce learning opportunities. This is particularly true for underprivileged students, whose parents may not be as well placed as affluent parents to provide supplemen- tary instruction for their children. Evidence suggests that the loss of learning increases with the duration of interruption (Quinn and Polikoff 2017). Online and distance learning can act as a temporary bridge, but are not an effective substitute (Baytiyeh 2018). School closures exacerbate fundamental divisions in the access to nutrition and safe environments for chil- dren. Because many schools provide free or subsidized meals to children from low-income households, clo- sures may result in greater food insecurity and poorer Figure 1.15.

Children home from school are also more likely to be exposed to violence and exploita- tion. In some countries, past evidence suggests school closures are associated with earlier marriages, children forced into militias, sexual exploitation, teen preg- nancies, and child labor (Korkoyah and Wreh 2015; UNDP 2015; UNESCO 2020). The closures are likely to have long-lasting con- sequences for future social and economic outcomes absent actions to try to regain the human capital accu- mulation lost. Lower lifetime schooling is associated with lower lifetime income (Card 1999). Interrupted schooling is also associated with lower earnings trajec- tories (Light 1995; Holmlund, Liu, and Skans 2008). In short, the subdued medium-term growth outlook for the global economy comes with the prospect of elevated debt, more poverty, higher inequality, and severe setbacks to human capital accumulation. Policy- makers will also have to confront additional complex- ities related to the outlook for inflation and trade, the subject of the next two sections. Inflation Is Expected to Remain Low As with the growth outlook, considerable uncer- tainty surrounds the inflation projections for the projection horizon. Competing forces will shape price developments in the years ahead (see Ebrahimy, Igan, and Martinez Peria 2020). •• Price pressures could increase, for example, due to the release of pent-up demand as consumers increase spending on items that they had been forced to delay consuming because of lockdowns and restric- tions on movement. They could also increase due to higher production costs from persistent supply dis- ruptions. The credibility of monetary policy frame- works can also affect price developments. Credibility can suffer where central banks are regarded as conducting monetary policy to keep government borrowing costs low rather than to ensure price stability (“fiscal dominance”). In those contexts, inflation expectations can increase very quickly once governments begin running large fiscal deficits. •• Counterbalancing such forces are those that will weigh on demand. These include a persistent increase in consumers’ precautionary saving prompted by higher perceived risk of joblessness and falling sick; transfers of purchasing power to lenders with lower propensities to spend as borrow- ers service the high debt incurred during the pan- demic; and concerns about the limits of monetary policy’s ability to stimulate demand (particularly in advanced economies), which cause inflation expecta- tions to slide and lead to disinflation. A sectoral decomposition of inflation in the period leading up to the pandemic and in the first six months of the pandemic offers clues about what to expect. Across a sample of advanced economies and large emerging market economies, the decline in inflation appears broad-based (Freitag and Lian, forthcoming). It reflects weak price pressures in sectors where price developments have historically responded to aggre- gate demand (furnishing, housing excluding energy, recreation, restaurants, and hotels) as well as in “noncyclical” sectors, where price movements typically are less sensitive to demand fluctuations (clothing and footwear, communications, education, health, transpor- tation services, and miscellaneous goods and services), as shown in Figure 1.16. With aggregate demand expected to be relatively weak and economies projected to operate with considerable slack into 2022, price pressures in the cyclically sensitive sectors are expected to stay muted. Moreover, inflation in the noncyclical group has been on a long-standing downward trend. The trend is expected to continue, given that these sec- tors are unlikely to experience supply constraints or ris- ing unit labor costs on account of slowing innovation. Market participants generally expect subdued inflation in advanced economies (Figure 1.17). Among emerging market economies, inflation expectations remain relatively low compared with historical aver- ages. Even as some emerging market central banks have embarked on asset purchases, these actions have so far not unanchored inflation expectations. Possible reasons include more credible monetary policy frameworks and communications explaining that the actions are also intended to support market functioning, consistent with price stability mandates. In line with the subdued outlook for activity, inflation is expected to remain relatively low over the forecast horizon. Inflation in the advanced economy group is projected at 0.8 percent in 2020, rising to 1.6 percent in 2021 as the recovery gains hold, and broadly stabilizing thereafter at 1.9 percent. In the emerging market and developing economy group, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-34-2048.jpg) ![16 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent International Monetary Fund | October 2020 inflation is projected at 5 percent this year, declining to 4.7 percent next year, and moderating thereafter to 4 percent over the medium term, below the historical average for the group. Subdued Trade Flows, Smaller Deficits and Surpluses Global trade growth is projected to weaken signifi- cantly. Global trade is expected to contract by over 10 percent this year—a pace similar to during the global financial crisis in 2009, despite the contraction in activity being much more pronounced this year. The current recession reflects a particularly sharp contrac- tion in contact-intensive sectors with much smaller trade intensity than manufacturing, which generally contracts sharply in recessions as demand for capital goods and consumer durables plummets. As noted in the 2020 External Sector Report, the expected decline in trade volumes largely reflects weak final demand from consumers and firms in the synchronized global downturn. Trade restrictions (for example on medical supplies) and supply chain disruptions are expected to play limited roles in accounting for the collapse. Noncyclical Cyclical Noncyclical Cyclical The decline in inﬂation appears broad based, encompassing sectors where price developments have historically responded to aggregate demand as well as in those in which price movements typically are less sensitive to demand ﬂuctuations.

Note: The ﬁgure plots the time ﬁxed effects of regressions in which three-month trailing averages of contributions to headline inﬂation are regressed on country and time ﬁxed effects, with the weights being the GDP in purchasing-power-parity terms. The contribution of a component is deﬁned as its year-on-year price change multiplied by its weight in the headline consumer price index basket. Country ﬁxed effects account for different timing of countries entering the sample, and the time ﬁxed effects are normalized to equal the contribution in January 2005. Cyclical components include furnishing, household equipment and routine household maintenance, housing (excluding utilities whenever the data permit), recreation and culture, and restaurants and hotels. Noncyclical components include clothing and footwear, communication, education, health, and miscella- neous goods and services. The deﬁnition of cyclical components follows the results of Stock and Watson (2019), except that furnishing, household equipment, and routine household maintenance are not included in their construction of cyclically sensitive inﬂation. Food and energy components are excluded to better reveal underlying trends. Transportation services are a noncyclical component in Stock and Watson (2019) and excluded here, as it was volatile in 2020 for advanced economies, and cannot be constructed without being combined with the fuel component for many emerging market and developing economies.

Subdued trade volumes also reflect, in part, possible shifts in supply chains as firms reshore production to reduce perceived vulnera- bilities from reliance on foreign producers. A reflection of this anticipated development is that foreign direct investment flows as a share of global GDP are expected to remain well below their levels of the pre-pandemic decade (Figure 1.18, panel 1). While all countries are expected to suffer large drops in exports and imports, the incidence is uneven. The trade outlook is particularly bleak for tourism-­dependent economies, where restrictions on international travel, together with consumers’ fear of contagion, are likely to weigh heavily on tourism activity even in situations where the pandemic appears contained for now (economies in the Caribbean, for example). Balance of payments data for the first half of the year show a collapse in net revenues from tourism and travel for countries in which these sectors play an important role (for instance, Greece, Iceland, Portugal, and Turkey; Figure 1.18, panel 2). And as Figure 1.18, panel 3 shows, countries where tourism and travel account for a larger share of GDP are projected to suffer larger declines in activity during 2020–21 com- pared with pre-COVID-19 forecasts. In addition, oil exporters have suffered a severe terms-of-trade shock with the decline in oil prices and face a more difficult external outlook. Remittances. Remittance flows contracted sharply during the early lockdown period but have shown signs of recovery. Nonetheless, the risk of a decline in payments and transfers from migrant workers back to their home countries is very significant, particularly for such countries as Bangladesh, Egypt, Guatemala, Pakistan, the Philippines, and those in sub-Saharan Africa more broadly. Global current account deficits and surpluses are projected to shrink in 2020 to the lowest level in the past two decades and to remain broadly stable thereaf- ter (Figure 1.19). Among creditor countries, surpluses are projected to decline in east Asia and to a lesser extent in Germany and the Netherlands, reflecting the weaker external environment, while the surplus in oil exporters is projected to turn into a modest deficit. These offset a modest increase in the projected surplus for China. Among debtor countries, smaller deficits are projected for Latin America, despite negative terms-of-trade shocks, mainly reflecting pronounced weakness in domestic demand, as well as for India and the United Kingdom on the back of lower oil prices and weak domestic demand.

If produced at the needed scale and distributed worldwide at afford- able prices, such a vaccine would lift sentiment and yield better growth outcomes than in the baseline, including by allowing for a fuller recovery in contact-intensive sectors and travel. Some of these aspects are featured in Scenario Box 1, which pres- ents growth projections under alternative scenarios. Downside risks, however, remain significant. They include the following: •• Outbreaks could recur in places. If the virus resurges, and progress on treatments and vaccines is slower than anticipated or countries’ access to them remains unequal, economic activity could be lower than expected, with renewed social distancing and tighter lockdowns. Cross-border spillovers from weaker external demand could further magnify the impact of country- or region-specific shocks on global growth. •• Premature withdrawal of policy support, or poor tar- geting of measures because of design and implemen- tation challenges, could lead to the dissolution of otherwise viable and productive economic relation- ships, exacerbating misallocation. •• Financial conditions may again tighten, as in March, exposing vulnerabilities. A sudden stop in new lend- ing (or failure to roll over existing debt) would tip some economies into debt crises and slow activity further. •• Liquidity shortfalls and insolvencies. Deep recessions invariably entail widespread liquidity shortfalls as firms suffer immediate revenue losses but still have to meet payroll expenses, cover fixed costs, and fulfill debt service obligations. Prolonged liquidity shortfalls can readily translate into bankruptcies and firm closures. This time around, there have been a few prominent bankruptcies, for example in retail and rental car sectors, and the rate of corporate bond defaults more broadly is at its highest since the global financial crisis (June 2020 GFSR Update). However, the aggressive and swift policy counter- measures have so far likely prevented even more widespread bankruptcies. But considering the sever- ity of the recession and the possible withdrawal of some of the emergency support in some countries, the risk of a wider cross-section of firms experi- encing deep liquidity shortfalls and bankruptcies is tangible (Box 1.3). Such events would lead to large job and income losses, further weakening demand. At the same time, they would deplete bank capital buffers and constrain credit supply, compounding the downturn. •• Intensifying social unrest. Instances of social unrest increased globally in 2019 before declining during the early part of the pandemic (Box 1.4). While ultimate causes vary across countries, in many cases, these include declining trust in established insti- tutions and lack of representation in governance structures, as well as a perceived disconnect between leaders’ priorities and the problems faced by the public. In June, social unrest increased in the United States and quickly spread worldwide in protests against institutional racism and racial inequality. More widespread or longer-lived protests could hurt sentiment and further weigh on activity. Intensify- ing social unrest may also complicate the political economy of reform efforts, to the detriment of medium-term growth or the sustainability of public finances. •• Geopolitical tensions. While seeming to de-escalate during the pandemic (Figure 1.21), geopolitical tensions could again flare up. Moreover, frayed ties among the OPEC+ coalition of oil producers (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Coun- tries, including Russia and other non-OPEC oil exporters) pose risks for global oil supply. A renewed plunge in prices as seen in March would severely hurt activity in oil exporters and lead to weaker growth than projected. •• Trade policy uncertainty and technology frictions. Despite the recent reaffirmation of the Phase One trade deal between the United States and China signed at the start of the year, tensions between the world’s two largest economies remain elevated on numerous fronts. Moreover, the United Kingdom’s transitional arrangement with the European Union expires on December 31, 2020. If the two sides fail to agree and ratify a trade deal before then, trade barriers between them are set to rise significantly, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-38-2048.jpg) ![20 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent International Monetary Fund | October 2020 which would increase business costs and could disrupt long-standing cross-border production arrangements. In addition, the bulk of the distor- tionary tariff and nontariff barriers instituted over the past two years remain in place (Figure 1.22). The World Trade Organization Appellate Body has ceased functioning because of the impasse over appointments, casting doubt over the enforceability of World Trade Organization legal commitments. Moreover, with the spread of trade disputes to the technology domain, global supply chains face additional threats from a bifurcation of technology standards and platforms. On the positive side, the trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States came into force on July 1, helping to lower near-term trade policy uncertainty (Figure 1.23). But lingering frictions (for example, on aluminum, rules of origin in the auto sector, and dairy trade) could hamper implementation. Trade policy uncertainty could increase again in these contexts or in discussions involving other trading partners, weighing on global growth. •• Weather-related natural disasters. The increased frequency and intensity of weather-related natural disasters, such as tropical storms, floods, heat waves, droughts, and wildfires has inflicted a devastating humanitarian toll and widespread livelihood loss on many regions in recent years (for example, Australia, the Caribbean, eastern and southern Africa, south Asia). Climate change, a principal driver of more frequent and intense weather-related disasters, already has had visible impacts—and not just in regions where the disasters strike. The disasters could also contribute to cross-border migration and financial stress (for example, in the insurance sector) or add to disease burdens. Moreover, they can have persistent effects long after the event itself (as seen, for example, in parts of eastern Africa, where heavy rainfall in late 2019 and earlier this year have contributed to an extreme locust infestation—the worst in decades—that has imperiled food supplies in the region).

All major economies are expected to operate well below capacity over 2020 and 2021 (Figure 1.24). Moreover, downside risks are significant. The immediate dual priority for policy is to ensure adequate resources for health care systems and to limit the economic damage. Difficult Trade-Offs: Near-Term Imperatives, Medium-Term Challenges Besides combating the deep near-term recession, policymakers will have to address complex challenges to place economies on a path of higher productivity growth while ensuring that gains are shared evenly and debt remains sustainable. Many countries already face very difficult trade-offs between implementing measures to support near-term growth and avoiding a further buildup of debt that will be difficult to service down the road, considering the crisis’s hit to potential output. Policies to support the economy in the near term should therefore be designed with an eye to fur- thering these broader objectives of guiding economies to paths of stronger, equitable, and resilient growth. Tax and spending measures should privilege initiatives that can help lift potential output, ensure participatory growth that benefits all, and protect the vulnerable. The additional debt incurred to finance such endeavors is more likely to pay for itself down the road by increasing the overall size of the economy and future tax base than if the borrowing were done to finance ill-targeted subsidies or wasteful current spend- ing. Investments in health, education, and high-return infrastructure projects that also help move the econ- omy to lower carbon dependence can further those objectives.

Moreover, safeguarding critical social spending can ensure the most vulnerable are protected while also supporting near-term activ- ity, since the outlays will go to groups with a higher propensity to spend their disposable income than more affluent individuals. In all instances, adhering to the highest standards of debt transparency will be essential to avoid future rollover difficulties and higher sover- eign risk premiums that raise borrowing costs across the economy. Enhancing Multilateral Cooperation The global nature of the shock, its cross-border spill- overs, and the resulting shared challenges point to a need for significant multilateral efforts toward fighting the health and economic crisis. Multilateral cooperation to support health care systems. National efforts on health will have to be supple- mented with extensive multilateral cooperation. A key priority is to fund advance purchase commitments of vaccines undergoing trials to encourage rapid scaling up of the manufacture and distribution of affordable doses worldwide (examples of such coordinated, mul- tilateral initiatives include the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance). The uncertainty and risk of failure associated with the search for effective and safe vaccines make global funding particularly important. A related pri- ority is to support countries with limited health care capacity. Their ability to avoid a catastrophic human toll depends critically on the international community stepping up medical assistance to them. Countries should also continue to remove trade restrictions on essential medical supplies and share information on the pandemic as well as on the search for vaccines and therapies. Financial support for constrained countries. Beyond assistance with medical equipment and know-how, several emerging market and developing economies— low-income countries in particular—require support from the international community through debt relief, grants, and concessional financing. Building on the Group of Twenty initiative for a temporary standstill on official debt service payments by low-income countries, private creditors should extend similar treatment as well so that those countries can conserve international liquidity and direct resources to priority health care spending and relief measures. Where debt restructuring is needed, all creditors and low-income country and emerging market borrowers should quickly agree on mutually acceptable terms. The global financial safety net can further help countries facing external funding shortfalls. As part of its response to the COVID-19 crisis, the IMF has expanded its lending toolkit to include a renewable and replenishable credit line for members with strong policy frameworks and funda- mentals, provided new financing through other lending facilities, temporarily increased access limits to its emergency financing facilities, and improved its ability to provide grant-based debt service relief. National-Level Policies Creating room to accommodate elevated spending on crisis countermeasures. A sizable and aggressive eco- nomic policy response is already under way in several countries, notably in advanced economies where their status as issuers of reserve currencies provides more latitude for countering the crisis compared with emerging market and developing economies. The longer this crisis persists, the greater will be the fiscal demands on governments—including by way of health care spending, unemployment benefits, cash transfers, and countercyclical initiatives to revive activity. While the crisis lasts, governments should do all that they can to mitigate the deep downturn and be ready to adapt strategy to respond to the evolution of the pandemic and its impact on activity. Where fiscal rules may con- strain action, temporary suspension of the rules would be warranted, combined with a commitment to a grad- ual consolidation path after the crisis abates to restore compliance with the rules over the medium term. Room for immediate spending needs could be created by prioritizing crisis countermeasures and reducing wasteful and poorly targeted subsidies. Prudent debt management—extending maturities on government borrowing and locking in low interest rates to the extent possible—can save debt service expenses and free up resources within the fiscal envelope to redirect toward crisis mitigation efforts (see also the recom- mendations in IMF 2020). Although instituting new revenue measures during the crisis will be difficult, governments may need to consider raising progressive taxes on more affluent individuals and those relatively less affected by the crisis (including increasing tax rates on higher income brackets, high-end property, capital gains, and wealth) as well as changes to corporate taxation that ensure firms pay taxes commensurate ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-41-2048.jpg) ![23 CHAPTER 1 GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES International Monetary Fund | October 2020 with profitability (see also Chapter 1 of the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor). Countries should also cooper- ate on the design of international corporate taxation to respond to the challenges of the digital economy. While implementing such initiatives, fiscal authorities should also clearly communicate their commitment to ensuring that public finances remain on a sustainable footing, drawing up credible consolidation plans that can be implemented after the crisis recedes. These policy objectives are shared across all coun- tries confronting the health and economic crisis, with particularly severe impacts on those heavily dependent on tourism, oil exports, and external remittances. The magnitude of the challenge is in general far greater in countries that entered this crisis with large preexisting vulnerabilities, limited policy space, and a high degree of informality that limits the extent to which relief measures can reach vulnerable people through exist- ing tax registries and banking channels. Such features typically correlate with tighter borrowing constraints. Without strong external support, those economies— particularly low-income countries with fragile health care systems, food and medical supply shortages, and volatile security situations—could be overwhelmed by the health and economic crisis. Resources for health care. With the pandemic con- tinuing to spread, all countries—including those where infections appear to have peaked—need to ensure that their health care systems can cope with the elevated demand for their services. This means securing ade- quate resources and prioritizing health care spending as needed, including on testing; contact tracing; personal protective equipment; life-saving equipment, such as ventilators; and facilities such as emergency rooms, intensive care units, and isolation wards. Policies to limit economic damage where the pandemic is accelerating. The foremost priority in countries where infections continue to rise unabated is to slow trans- mission. As Chapter 2 shows, lockdowns are effective in bringing down infections. A necessary investment in public health, they pave the way for eventual economic recovery from the severe downturn brought on by mobility constraints. •• Economic policy countermeasures in such cases should limit the damage by cushioning income losses for people and firms. Among particularly effective measures in this regard are targeted tempo- rary tax breaks for affected people and firms, wage subsidies for furloughed workers, cash transfers, allowances for postponements of financial payments, and paid sick and family leave. Expanded eligibility criteria for unemployment insurance and better coverage of self-employed workers should also be considered among efforts to strengthen the broader safety net. Such measures have already supported disposable income in many advanced economies and, to an extent, across emerging market and developing economies, preventing even further deep declines in spending. Where needed, temporary credit guarantees and loan restructuring can help solvent-but-illiquid firms remain afloat and preserve employment relationships likely to remain viable after the pandemic fades. •• At the same time, retraining and reskilling should be pursued to the extent feasible so that workers can look for jobs in other sectors, as needed. Because the transition may take a while, displaced workers will need extended income support as they retrain and search for jobs. •• Complementing the targeted measures, broad-based monetary, financial regulatory, and fiscal responses can help prevent deeper and longer-lasting down- turns, even if mobility restrictions hamper their ability to stimulate spending to the extent typical in other recessions. These broader responses can boost credit provision (for example, through central bank liquidity support and targeted relending facilities for affected firms or regulatory actions to temporarily ease loan classification standards and provisioning requirements). Increases in borrowing costs can be contained through central bank policy rate cuts where interest rates are not already at their effective lower bound, or through asset purchases and for- ward guidance where interest rates are already at that limit. Among emerging market central banks that launch asset purchases, it is important to commu- nicate clearly the objectives of the program and its consistency with price stability objectives. Doing so would mitigate the risks of perceived fiscal domi- nance, inflation, and capital flight. Fiscal stimulus through public infrastructure investment or across- the-board tax cuts (where financing constraints permit) can support confidence, protect corporate cash flow, and limit bankruptcies. As the pandemic evolves, its effects on different sectors become more obvious, and policymakers learn more about what is most effective, the economic policy response for limiting the damage will have to adjust as well. It will need to avoid locking people and inputs ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-42-2048.jpg) ![24 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent International Monetary Fund | October 2020 into sectors unlikely to return to pre-pandemic vitality, while at the same time supporting the vulnerable. Supporting the recovery where reopening is under way. As noted earlier, many economies that began reopen- ing in May and June have since slowed or paused that process. Workplace closures remain, but are not as widespread as a few months ago. As countries reopen, policies must support the recovery by gradually remov- ing targeted support, continuing to facilitate realloca- tion to sectors less affected by social distancing, and providing stimulus to the extent possible. •• The unwinding of measures such as wage subsidies, cash transfers, enhanced unemployment benefits, and credit guarantees for small and medium enterprises should be calibrated to the pace of the recovery and start only after activity picks up durably. Premature scaling back of such lifelines, especially while infec- tions are surging and may require renewed contain- ment measures, risks pushing the economy back into recession. Moreover, the pace at which particular measures are unwound depends on the structure of the economy. For instance, in economies with a large share of self-employed people and significant infor- mality, cash and in-kind transfers to households may need to continue for longer while other measures are scaled back. In economies where medium and large enterprises account for a large share of employment, credit guarantees and liquidity support for firms and wage subsidies for employed workers may need to be maintained to avoid sudden increases in joblessness, even as other lifelines are gradually withdrawn. •• As fiscal resources are freed from targeted support, some should be redeployed to public investment. Examples include investments in renewable energy, improvements in the efficiency of power trans- mission, and retrofitting buildings to reduce their carbon footprint (see also Chapter 2 of the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor). Moreover, as lifelines are unwound, social spending should be expanded to protect the most vulnerable. For example, where gaps exist and as needed, authorities could enhance safety net measures, such as paid and family sick leave, expanded eligibility for unemployment insur- ance, and strengthened health care benefit coverage. •• Complementing these efforts, hiring subsidies and additional spending on retraining, coupled with income support for displaced workers, can help smooth the transition. Measures to reduce labor market rigidities that deter firms from hiring can also help reallocate employment toward growing sectors. Moreover, an important part of the reallo- cation will involve balance sheet repair (see details in the section on policies to address medium- and long-term challenges). •• During the transition, where inflation expectations are anchored, accommodative monetary policy can help by ensuring that borrowing costs remain low and credit conditions supportive. The prospects of relatively low inflation over the medium term suggest that central banks have room to allow the recovery to take root firmly before they exit their current settings. Limiting the damage in countries with large informal sectors. Many of the measures discussed so far rely on well-established tax registries and widespread access to bank accounts to ensure that relief reaches those who need it. But such infrastructure is often missing in economies with a large share of informal employment. In those countries, government relief can be delivered through digital payment systems, for instance as was done in Benin and Côte d’Ivoire (see also Díez and others 2020). In some countries, centralized databases with assigned identification numbers have been used to provide targeted assistance to market traders, taxi drivers, and others most affected during shutdowns (for example, in Togo). Additional challenges arise where individuals do not have mobile phones or iden- tification numbers and may therefore not be covered by digital payments. In such cases, workarounds to deliver relief can include in-kind support of food, medicine, and other essentials delivered through local governments, community organizations, and special- ized stores that stock subsidized goods (Prady 2020). To counter further shocks, policymakers should also strengthen mechanisms for automatic, timely, and tem- porary support in downturns. As discussed in the April 2020 WEO, rules-based fiscal stimulus triggered by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions—such as tem- porary targeted cash transfers to liquidity-­constrained low-income households that activate when unemploy- ment or jobless claims rise above a certain threshold— can help dampen downturns. Policies to Address Medium- and Long-Term Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic is a transformational event unlike any seen since World War II. The damages to supply potential, the buildup of debt, ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-43-2048.jpg) ![25 CHAPTER 1 GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES International Monetary Fund | October 2020 and implications for inequality discussed above are likely to exacerbate issues that predate the pandemic, and the setback to human capital accumulation is a new challenge. This section discusses policy priorities to address these challenges. Catalyzing Stronger, Environmentally Sustainable Growth Productivity growth had already slowed across both advanced and emerging market and develop- ing economies in the 15 years before the pandemic, going back to before the global financial crisis (Adler and others 2017; October 2018 WEO, Chapter 2). The damage to supply potential in the medium-term projections reflects in part a continuation of forces that had dragged productivity growth lower in the years leading up to the pandemic: relatively slow investment growth weighing on physical capital accumulation, more modest improvements in human capital, and slower efficiency gains in combining technology with available factors of production, partly reflecting sec- toral mismatches. Policy initiatives that can counteract these forces include repairing balance sheets and disposing of distressed debt so that investment can recover quickly. Policymakers should also address labor market rigid- ities and reduce barriers to entry that may hamper redeployment of resources to growing sectors. In this regard, the corporate sector shake-up induced by the pandemic—particularly the exit of smaller firms— risks reinforcing the trend of broad-based increases in concentration and market power across the economy (Chapter 3 of the April 2019 WEO), posing a threat to dynamism and innovation. Competition policy frameworks and scrutiny of corporate mergers need to ensure that such developments do not lead to abuses of market power and that small start-ups can continue competing on a level playing field with incumbents. Facilitating new growth opportunities, including to speed the transition to a low-carbon economy. In addi- tion, as discussed in Chapter 3, a green investment push to increase reliance on renewables, improve efficiency of the grid, and retrofit buildings to increase energy conservation could also spur capital spending in such sectors as construction materials and energy-­ efficient heating systems, while speeding the transition to a lower-carbon growth path. The European Union’s agreement to target 30 percent of the Next Generation recovery fund to climate-change-related spending is a step in this direction. More broadly, efforts to promote investment in new growth areas would also help with the post-pandemic reorganization of the economy as firms take advantage of new opportunities. An emerg- ing cluster of growth opportunities during the pan- demic relates to the accelerated shift to e-commerce, increasing digitalization of the economy, and possible innovation of new data-enabled services. Another cluster relates to medicine and biotechnology. Boosting Human Capital Accumulation The global loss of learning as schools and universi- ties stay closed for a large part of 2020 is likely to be one of the most enduring legacies of the COVID-19 crisis. Virtual learning may not be an adequate sub- stitute, even in locations with widespread high-speed internet connectivity where consumers have adequate access to online learning and supplementary instruc- tion is available at home. Loss of learning can have long-lasting consequences on individuals’ lifetime earn- ing potential and economy-wide productivity growth. Policymakers will have to devise makeup strategies for use when the pandemic is under control and it is safe to resume full-time schooling. Options could include setting aside funding to accommodate adjustments to the length of the school year, training teachers on remedial approaches to correct learning losses, and instituting or expanding supplementary after-school tutoring programs (see WB 2020b). At the same time, educational and vocational programs will need to accommodate training needs in jobs that are likely to be in high demand (emergency first responders, nurses, and lab technicians and digital literacy more broadly, so that more and more people can take advantage of teleworking opportunities). Even with these adapta- tions in vocational programs, take-up may still fall short if the training involves acquiring a substantively different and challenging set of skills, raising the possibility of a persistent increase in dropouts and large numbers of people in neither education, employment, nor training. Making Gains More Equitable The setback to human capital accumulation is one dimension along which inequality is likely to increase as a result of the pandemic, as already discussed. Among the social spending measures beyond education to counter the increase in inequality are strengthening ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-44-2048.jpg) ![26 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent International Monetary Fund | October 2020 social assistance (for example, conditional cash transfers, food stamps and in-kind nutrition, medical payments for low-income households), expanding social insurance (relaxing eligibility criteria for unem- ployment insurance, extending the coverage of paid family and sick leave), and investments in retraining and reskilling programs to boost reemployment pros- pects for displaced workers. Resolving Debt Overhangs The scope for actions to boost productivity growth, accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, and reduce inequality is limited in many instances because elevated debt levels entering the crisis are set to rise further. Sovereign debt overhang. Governments with large debt stocks will need to consider options to raise revenues and gradually decrease expenditures over the medium term. These include measures to increase progressivity in the tax code discussed earlier. Efforts to expand the tax base can include reducing corporate tax breaks, applying tighter caps on personal income tax deductions, instituting value-added taxes where not part of the code, and improving the coverage of tax registries and electronic filing of returns. On the spending side, scaling back such outlays as poorly targeted and wasteful subsidies would help with con- solidation. In some cases, restructuring of sovereign debt may be needed to alleviate financing pressures and restore debt sustainability, although this brings its own challenges, including potentially long-lasting impacts on a sovereign’s credibility. Where available, collective action clauses may need to be activated to speed up the process. Restructuring options could include maturity extensions, interest rate reductions, principal reductions (haircuts), and other debt swaps (with renegotiated terms). Corporate debt overhang. Resolving the likely large corporate debt overhang coming out the crisis will first require triaging business cases into those that are considered ultimately viable and can be restruc- tured versus those that are unviable. In the case of systemically important firms, equity injections may be considered. If a firm’s business model appears viable over the medium term, restructuring its balance sheet and providing liquidity support are appropriate. Special out-of-court restructuring frameworks may need to be strengthened (or established) to help deal with the expected high number of cases. Standardized restructuring solutions and incentives (deadlines for agreements, fines for creditors, threat of liquidation to debtors) will be needed to expedite restructuring (Liu, Garrido, and DeLong 2020). To help deal with a potential rise in nonperforming loans, supervisors should enhance regulatory oversight (for example, through more robust provisioning, write-offs, and income recognition), whereas banks should strengthen their internal nonperforming loan management capa- bilities. The development of distressed debt markets can be supported by increasing access to debtor information, removing regulatory barriers (for example, enabling nonbanks to own and manage nonperform- ing loans) and improving the quality of collateral valuations. Tax rules that inhibit debt restructurings or write-offs should also be amended (Aiyar and others 2015; Awad and others 2020). The scale of the COVID-19 shock and potential for larger spillovers from bankruptcies than in normal recessions argue for providing more ample solvency support than usual, except for firms that were already insolvent before the crisis began. Tax measures, such as loss carrybacks, could help support previously viable firms. For large firms, support can take the form of direct equity injections or junior debt claims with warrants that allow the public purse to benefit from eventual return to profitability. For unlisted small and medium enterprises, where direct equity injections are not an option, support could involve grants today that are partially recovered by a temporarily higher corpo- rate tax rate in future. Where long-lived or structural shifts in consump- tion and production chains are taking place and a firm’s medium-term prospects are poor, liquidation to enable reallocation of capital and labor to better uses may be needed. For firms rendered unviable by persistent structural changes, it is essential to have an efficient and equitable corporate bankruptcy framework that can apportion losses across investors, banks, and owners. Multilateral Policies to Ensure a Sustained Global Recovery Beyond the current pandemic, as noted in the section on risks, intensifying trade and technol- ogy tensions between countries could drag global growth starkly lower than the baseline projection. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-45-2048.jpg) ![27 CHAPTER 1 GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES International Monetary Fund | October 2020 Effective multilateral cooperation to defuse these ten- sions and address gaps in the rules-based multilateral trading system would go a long way toward preventing such outcomes. Countries must also act collectively to implement their climate change mitigation commitments. As discussed in Chapter 3, joint action—particularly by the largest emitters—that combines a green investment push, together with steadily rising carbon prices, is needed to achieve emission reductions consistent with limiting global temperature increases to the targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement. A broadly adopted, growth-friendly mitigation package could raise global activity through investment in green infrastructure over the near term, with modest output costs over the medium term as economies transition away from fossil fuels toward cleaner technologies. Relative to unchanged policies, such a package would significantly boost incomes in the second half of the century by avoiding damages and catastrophic risks from climate change. The global community should also take urgent steps to strengthen its defenses against calamitous health crises, for instance by augmenting stockpiles of protective equipment and essential medical supplies, financing research, and ensuring adequate ongo- ing assistance to countries with limited health care capacity, including through support of international organizations. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-46-2048.jpg) ![28 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent International Monetary Fund | October 2020 Here, the G20 Model1 is used to estimate the potential impact on activity of two alternative paths for the evolution of the fight against COVID-19. In the first alternative—the downside—containing the virus proves to be a more difficult and pro- tracted struggle until a vaccine is widely available. In the second alternative—the upside—it is assumed that all dimensions of the fight against the virus go well. Downside Scenario: Containment Proves Much More Difficult For the downside scenario (red line in Scenario Figure 1), it is assumed that measures to contain the spread—either mandated or voluntary—slightly increase the direct drag on activity in the second half of 2020 as the virus proves more difficult to contain. Further, it is assumed that in 2021 progress on all fronts in the fight against the virus proves to be slower than assumed in the baseline, including progress on vaccines, treatments, and adherence to social distancing guidelines to contain the virus’s spread. This leads to a deterioration in activity in contact-intensive sectors, with the associated income effects spilling over to other sectors. These domestic demand effects are then amplified via trade. Finan- cial conditions are also assumed to tighten, with corporate spreads rising in advanced economies and both corporate and sovereign spreads widening in emerging market economies. The increase in 2020 is quite mild but grows to be more substantive in 2021 as the weakness in activity persists. Finan- cial conditions gradually return to baseline beyond 2022. Fiscal authorities in advanced economies are assumed to respond with an increase in transfers beyond standard automatic stabilizers, while those in emerging market economies are assumed to be more constrained, with only automatic stabilizers operating. Monetary authorities in advanced econo- mies with constraints on conventional policy space are assumed to use unconventional measures to contain increases in long-term interest rates. The more protracted weakness in activity is assumed to create additional, persistent damage to economies’ The authors of this box are Ben Hunt and Susanna Mursula. 1The G20 Model is a global, structural model of the world economy, capturing international spillovers and key economic relationships among the household, corporate, and government sectors, including monetary policy. supply capacity, with a loss in productive capital, a persistent rise in the natural rate of unemployment, and temporarily weaker productivity growth. These scarring effects are assumed to be largely felt in 2022 and beyond. Panel 1 in Scenario Figure 2 contains a decomposition of the impact on global GDP of the four key layers of the downside scenario.

Consequently, even tighter financial conditions for emerging market economies exacerbate the difference, which is further reinforced by more substantive scarring. After 2021 growth rises above baseline for several years, but the level of global GDP is still roughly 1.5 percent below baseline by the end of the World Economic Outlook horizon in 2025. The negative impact on the level of GDP is roughly twice as large for emerging market economies as for advanced economies. The more protracted neg- ative impact on activity, combined with the additional fiscal expenditures to support incomes, leads to a marked increase in public indebtedness. Debt-to-GDP ratios rise by well above 10 percentage points, on average, for advanced economies, but by a more modest 5 percentage points for emerging market economies by 2022. Upside Scenario: All Dimensions of the Fight against the Virus Go Well Under the upside scenario, (blue line in Scenario Figure 1) it is assumed that all things in the fight against COVID-19 go much better than assumed in the baseline. On the treatment front, advances quickly start to reduce the fatality rate, reducing fear and helping to restore confidence. An early and substantial ramp-up in investment in vaccine production capa- bilities and cooperation agreements in the associated global supply chain lead to earlier, widespread vaccine availability. Complete openness and transparency in the underlying science increase confidence in vaccine efficacy and safety, leading to widespread vaccinations. All these advances will allow activity in the contact-intensive sectors, which have been most adversely affected, to bounce back more quickly than assumed in the baseline. In addition, the overall improvement in confidence will lead to higher spend- ing across other sectors as uncertainty about future income prospects subsides. More buoyant activity will in turn lead to improved prospects for firms and less deterioration in fiscal positions, driving an easing in risk premiums. Further, the faster bounce-back will lead to fewer bankruptcies, less labor market disloca- tion, and a milder slowing in productivity growth than assumed in the baseline. The improvements in these supply side factors start in 2023 and grow. On the policy front, with the improvement in activity, fiscal withdrawal is assumed to be only in terms of auto- matic stabilizers, and monetary authorities everywhere are assumed to be able to accommodate the faster growth without imperiling their price stability objec- tives. Panel 2 in Scenario Figure 2 contains a decom- position of the impact on global GDP of the three key layers under the upside scenario. Global growth under the upside scenario gradually accelerates relative to the baseline, with growth roughly ½ percentage point higher in 2021, rising to roughly 1 percentage point higher by 2023. In 2024 the pickup moderates, with growth slightly below baseline by 2025. Although both advanced and emerging market economies see marked improvements in activity, emerg- ing market economies benefit more, as the baseline assumes that the impact of limited progress in measures to fight the virus falls more heavily on these econo- mies. Further, the difference is magnified by the larger relative easing in risk premiums and a larger unwinding of the scarring embedded in the baseline.

Revised results for the preceding reference year, 2011, and estimates of annual PPPs for 2012–16 were also released.1 PPPs are used to convert different currencies to a common currency and equalize their purchasing power by eliminating differences in price levels between economies.

Estimates of regional and world output and growth, along with forecasts, are key macroeconomic indicators reported in many of the IMF’s flagship publications, including the World Economic Outlook (WEO). The revised PPPs used in the October 2020 WEO are based on 2011–17 data from the ICP 2017 survey, which are then extended forward and backward by using the growth rates in relative GDP deflators (the GDP deflator of a country divided by the GDP deflator of the United States). These generate PPP-based GDP, which is used as weights to compute regional and global real GDP growth and other real sector aggregates, including inflation.2 2See WEO FAQ for more information on the aggregation method and use of PPPs in the WEO.

How- ever, the focus here is on the weight revisions for a given year, with the main change being a shift in the relative weight of advanced economies, whose share of the global economy for 2019 is now estimated at 43 percent—higher than the previous calculation of 40 percent. Looking at changes for different regions and economies, euro area countries and the United States are estimated to have higher shares in 2019 than before. Meanwhile, revisions for China and India together mostly account for the smaller shares of emerging Asia and emerging market and devel- oping economies as a whole in new weights. Latin America and the Caribbean and emerging Europe have a slightly larger global weight, while the Middle East and Central Asia region has a smaller global weight. The weight of sub-Saharan Africa is virtually unchanged. The country shares in world GDP used as weights to derive world output growth could differ, depending on whether the GDP shares are valued at PPP or market exchange rates.3 Revisions in PPPs notwithstanding, emerging market and developing economies represent a much smaller fraction of global GDP at market exchange rates of 41 percent than at PPP of 57 percent for 2019, reflecting their more limited purchasing power in international markets. Factors behind PPP Weight Revision Sizable discrepancies can arise between PPPs from a new cycle and extrapolated PPPs from a previous cycle as the new cycle brings forth additional and updated information on the world. The six-year gap between ICP cycles resulted in notable differences for some economies.4 One of the assumptions underly- ing PPP extrapolations for GDP is that the structure of each country’s economy is similar to that of the 3Table 1.1 of the WEO report presents both measures of world output. 4While the extrapolation methodology used is robust, the estimates based on extrapolation—for example, the 2017 value derived from ICP 2011—should not be expected to match the corresponding year in the new ICP 2017 survey. See McCarthy (2013) and Deaton and Aten (2017). numeraire country and changes in the same way over time. In practice, however, structures and changes can be very different. This is significant, particularly when developing economies are compared with an advanced economy. For example, the Chinese economy has been developing rapidly in recent years, and its structure has changed in a significantly different way from that of the United States. Although the ICP provides revised 2011 PPP values with ICP 2017 results, 2011 revisions are small, and the new 2017 estimates drive the changes in PPP paths over 2011–17 compared with those extrapolated from the 2011 ICP vintage. Figure 1.1.1 shows that China’s 2019 GDP share has been revised down, with the PPP conversion rate depreciating relative to previous estimates. This implies that the increase in overall prices in China was underestimated with extrapolation derived from ICP 2011. In ICP 2017, the relative price level in China in 2019 is now higher, and GDP converted at the PPP rate is therefore smaller. This in turn leads to a lower 2019 PPP share for China in the global economy using Share in world PPP GDP: ICP 2017 Share in world PPP GDP: ICP 2011 PPP conversion rate: ICP 2017 (right scale) PPP conversion rate: ICP 2011 (right scale) Sources: June 2020 World Economic Outlook Update; IMF staff calculations.

This implies that increases in overall prices exceed differences in GDP deflators. Impact of PPP Revision on Aggregate Growth As an illustration of how the change in weights can affect the calculation of aggregate growth rates, Table 1.1.2 compares the aggregation of the June 2020 WEO Update country forecasts based on ICP 2011 with those based on ICP 2017. The lower weight of fast-growing emerging Asia and the larger weight of advanced economies under ICP 2017 imply that global growth calculated with the new weights is slightly lower. Average global growth is estimated at 3.2 percent for 2018–19 and 3.6 percent for 2011–17, some 0.1 percentage point lower than with the old weights. For 2020 the aggregation of the June 2020 WEO Update country forecasts with the new weights yields an aggregate global growth rate projection of –5.2 percent for 2020 (compared with the projection of –4.9 percent in the June 2020 WEO Update, which used the old weights).5 The reduction in the relative weight of its fastest-growing region also implies slightly lower average growth for emerging market and devel- oping economies using the ICP 2017 weights com- pared with the estimate using the ICP 2011 weights. 5GDP share and aggregate growth calculations based on ICP 2017 presented here are based on the most recent data of the June 2020 WEO Update and may differ from the final estimates in the October 2020 WEO.

The number of people in extreme poverty is likely to rise substantially this year, for the first time in more than 20 years, and income inequality, on average, across these economies could rise back to levels seen in 2008, reversing gains since the global financial crisis. Life expectancy is less likely to be affected, although there are downside risks related to the fragile state of health care systems and interruptions in treatments of other life-threatening illnesses. In the two decades prior to the COVID-19 crisis, emerging market and developing economies grew by 4.1 percent on average—one percentage point higher than during the preceding two decades (1980–99). With slowing population growth, per capita growth shows a sharper contrast: 2.4 percent in 2000–19 versus 1.0 percent in 1980–99. A key question is how much progress has been made in the past 20 years toward enhancing inclusiveness (in poverty reduction, improvements in life expectancy, and greater equality) within countries.1 With the pandemic, real GDP in emerging market and developing economies is expected to decline by 3.3 percent in 2020. This crisis is disproportionately affecting vulnerable workers, putting at risk much of the progress achieved before the crisis and likely exacerbating remaining gaps. Against this backdrop, a second key question is how the pandemic will affect inclusiveness in these economies. Stocktaking: Progress on Inclusiveness prior to the Pandemic Remarkable progress was made on poverty reduction since 2000 until the pandemic started.2 The authors of this box are Gabriela Cugat and Futoshi Narita, with contributions from the authors of Brussevich, Dabla-Norris, and Khalid (2020) and Bannister and Mour- mouras (2017) as well as Albe Gjonbalaj. This box is part of a research project on macroeconomic policy in low-income coun- tries supported by the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Common- wealth and Development Office (FCDO). The views expressed here do not necessarily represent the views of the FCDO. 1For further discussion focused on low-income developing countries, see Fabrizio and others (2017); Chapter 1 of the April 2020 Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Economic Outlook discusses progress made in sub-Saharan African countries. 2For further discussion, see WB (2018). The share of people living on less than $1.90 a day (in 2011 purchasing-power-parity terms) in the total population declined from 25 percent in 2002 to 12 percent in 2018, on average, with stronger progress in low-income developing countries (Figure 1.2.1, panel 1).3 On top of improvements in the extensive margin of poverty (headcount measure), the poverty gap index (how far below the poverty line the poor in a given country fall) points to improvements in the intensive margin (average distance from $1.90 a day among people living in poverty), indicating that the average annual money transfer per person living in poverty necessary to end extreme poverty declined from $240 to $184 (for perfectly targeted transfers). Health-related indicators also showed significant progress before the crisis. Life expectancy exhibited strong “convergence”—levels substantially increased for almost all emerging market and developing economies, and the increase was stronger for countries with lower life expectancy, most of which are low-income devel- oping countries (Figure 1.2.1, panel 2).4 The conver- gence can also be seen within countries: inequality in life expectancy across people in a country was reduced, though to a lesser extent. Other health indicators also showed significant progress, including mortality under age five, maternal mortality, and access to clean water. Nevertheless, challenges remain in health care systems in many of these economies and make them particu- larly vulnerable to the pandemic (see WB 2019). Despite advances in poverty reduction and improve- ment in life expectancy, progress in reducing income inequality has been slow over the past two decades. The Gini coefficient (a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent income inequality) declined only gradually, by 3 percentage points—from 44 to 41, on average—during this period (Figure 1.2.2, panel 1). Wide gaps with respect to the average level of advanced economies remain for many emerging market and developing economies, while some others in this country group have already reached that level. Progress has been weaker for low-income developing countries, with one-third of them seeing an increase in income inequality. Similarly, the Palma ratio shows that the total income of the top 10 percent is twice as large as the total income of the bottom 40 percent in 3As the data examined in this box are mostly sparse, data points for a given year are averaged over the year and the previ- ous four years. 4For further discussion, see UNDP (2019).

However, educa- tional attainment of women also remains lower than that of men in most of these economies, especially in low-income countries. The Impact of the Pandemic on Inclusiveness The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to both halt the improving trends and widen existing gaps in inclu- siveness. The World Bank estimates that, compared with pre-pandemic projections, the COVID-19 pan- demic will increase the global share of people living on less than $1.90 a day by 1.14 percentage points, which represents almost 90 million people newly living in extreme poverty—the first increase since 1998.8 In terms of life expectancy, the COVID-19 impact is currently projected to be moderate.9 How- ever, downside risk factors are related to more fragile health care systems than in advanced economies and interruptions in other health services to treat and prevent HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis (see Hogan and others 2020). Income inequality widened during past pandemics, especially over the medium term (see Furceri and others 2020). Furthermore, the impact on inequality is expected to be much larger than in the past because the COVID-19 crisis and associated containment measures are disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable (see Adams and others 2020 and Shibata 2020). Gender equality is also being under- mined and could experience a sharp setback under the current circumstances (see Alon and others 2020 and Georgieva and others 2020). Although it is difficult to quantify distributional impacts of the pandemic on many economies in a comparable way, a parsimonious estimate based on lower telework ability for lower-paying jobs indi- cates a strong setback in progress made on income inequality since the global financial crisis. Brussevich, Dabla-Norris, and Khalid 2020 estimate the degree of telework ability across 35 economies and finds that it is generally lower for low-income earners than high-income earners (Figure 1.2.3, panel 1). Other real-time survey data also show that more tele-workable sectors saw a smaller loss of employment 8See WB (2020a). The estimate corresponds to the baseline projection without change in inequality. 9With younger populations (of a median age of 27 years) being less vulnerable to the disease so far, the mortality burden is several times smaller than in advanced economies (Decerf and others 2020).

Note: In panel 2, the impact on the Gini index is estimated by distributing the aggregate income shock (based on the IMF’s real GDP projections) to the income quintile shares, in proportion to telework ability, whose magnitude is calibrated using the estimated coefﬁcient of telework ability in the regression of employment loss across sectors using the data by Bick, Blandin, and Mertens (2020, Appendix Table C1). Percent changes in the Gini index are obtained as the changes in an approximated Gini index based only on the income quintile shares. The (closest) economy group average is used when the telework ability index is missing. Data points for a given year are averaged over the year and the previous four years.

Extrapolating these findings to emerging market and developing economies, the aggregate decrease in income (taken from the IMF’s latest real GDP projections) can be distributed among the groups of people divided by income quintiles for each economy, in proportion to telework ability.10 The resultant impact (without reflecting any redistribution policies or other factors) on the income shares by income quintile are used to estimate a percent change in the Gini coefficient in 2020. These show that the average Gini coefficient for emerging market and developing economies would increase by 2.6 percentage points to 42.7, broadly comparable to the level in 2008, implying that gains since the global financial crisis could be reversed (Figure 1.2.3, panel 2). A simple welfare measure that goes beyond GDP indicates that there was good progress before the pandemic and that a strong reversal due to this crisis can be expected. The measure, proposed by Jones and Klenow (2016), takes into account four factors: (1) real consumption per capita, (2) life expectancy, (3) leisure time, and (4) consumption inequality.11 Combining these factors, the average welfare improve- ment in 56 emerging market and developing econ- omies with available data from 2002 to 2019 was equivalent to a 6 percent increase in annual consump- tion levels in every year (Figure 1.2.4). This exceeded per capita real GDP growth in the same period by 1.3 percentage points. The excess welfare growth stems almost entirely from longer life expectancy. A setback in welfare in 2020 could exceed 8 percent, driven in 10How the shock affects the income quintile shares depending on telework ability is calibrated using the estimated coefficient of telework ability in the regression of employment loss across sectors using the data from Bick and others (2020, Appendix Table C1). The (closest) economy group average is used when the telework ability index is missing. 11See Jones and Klenow (2016), which proposes a welfare measure in percent of annual consumption, based on the lifetime expected utility of an imaginary person just before she or he is born in a country in a given year, under many strong assump- tions that are needed to compute this measure for a large set of countries with only aggregate-level data. See the online appendix of Jones and Klenow (2016) for a detailed discussion on caveats regarding this measure. In addition, for an extension to reflect net welfare losses from environmental issues, see Bannister and Mourmouras (2017). large part by the excess change in inequality, as indi- cated by parsimonious estimates. Since 2000 emerging market and developing economies have made appreciable progress in poverty reduction and increasing life expectancy. COVID-19 threatens to set back such progress, particularly in terms of poverty reduction, and to widen existing gaps in terms of income inequality, access to education, and gender equality. Redistribution policies and measures to support affected people and firms are essential to mitigate sizable adverse impacts on inequality and on welfare more generally.

Note: The welfare measure is based on Jones and Klenow (2016, equation 7). For different scenarios on inequality in 2020, the “no change in Gini” scenario uses the latest observations; the “Gini increase in past pandemic” scenario applies a 1¼ percent increase to all economies, based on the ﬁndings of Furceri and others (2020) on the net Gini index; and the “telework ability” scenario is based on parsimonious estimates using various levels of telework ability across income groups within countries (see Figure 1.2.3, panel 2). Macroeconomic data are extrapolated from the IMF’s latest projections. The impacts on life expectancy and employment are estimated using a multigroup susceptible-infected- removed model.

These firms typically are more vulnerable than their larger counterparts, reflecting, among other factors, their limited buffers and access to credit. However, the effects of the current crisis on SMEs are likely to be even more severe than in previous crises because SMEs are most prevalent among the hardest-hit sectors, such as restaurants, hotels, and arts and entertainment. Consequently, liquidity and solvency risks are bound to increase, putting both SME jobs and debt at risk. This box assesses jobs at risk and discusses policy options to address rising bankruptcy risks among SMEs. Using the same data and framework, Chapter 1 of the October 2020 Global Financial Stability Report assesses implications for financial stability, with partic- ular focus on SME debt at risk. The analysis builds on the methodology proposed by Gourinchas and others (2020) and uses Orbis data for SMEs across 21 (mostly advanced) economies.1 To assess the liquidity risks, the analysis considers whether a firm has enough cash available at the end of 2020 to cover its operational and financial expenses, under the assumption that it can roll over maturing debt but cannot take on additional debt. Likewise, for insolvency risks, the analysis focuses on whether a firm’s net equity is projected to become negative at the end of 2020. The analysis shows that firms in distress account for 9 to 13 percent of total SME (in sample) employment, depending on the stress measure chosen—­insolvency or illiquidity. This represents almost a doubling of SME jobs at risk due to liquid- ity risks (and a 50 percent increase due to insolvency risks) vis-à-vis a scenario without COVID-19 (see Figure 1.3.1, panel 1). Using illiquidity as a distress measure, the share of jobs at risk climbs to 30 and 40 percent for the “arts and entertainment” and “food and accommodation” sectors, respectively, reflecting their comparatively larger drop in output and greater job intensity (Figure 1.3.1, panel 2).2 The authors of this box are Federico Díez and Chiara Maggi. 1The countries included are Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 2Accounting for the massive government support provided by most countries dampens these projections. This support is difficult to quantify because it has come in multiple forms with widely different take-up rates across firms and countries. Bearing these limitations in mind, preliminary simulations suggest that the announced government support could have significantly dampened the rise in liquidity shortages and insolvency rates in some European countries (Chapter 3 of the October 2020 Regional Economic Outlook: Europe).

While standard advice involves providing liquidity to illiquid but solvent firms, and restructuring insolvent firms to facilitate swift resource reallocation, this time is different. The magnitude of the shock, the uncertainty about its duration, and the macro-financial amplifiers associ- ated with mass bankruptcies justify ampler-than-usual recourse to solvency support. This comes over and above the need to cut the legal and financial costs of bankruptcy procedures to alleviate risks of overwhelming bankruptcy courts. The multiple ways governments provide solvency support to firms can involve important trade-offs— such as balancing the reach and cost-effectiveness of support, minimizing unwarranted bankruptcies, and containing fiscal costs, as well as promoting firms (and jobs) preservation and resource reallo- cation. Figure 1.3.2 shows the impact on projected insolvency rates of two illustrative options—giving all SMEs 5 percent of their pre-pandemic annual revenues (accounting for more than 4 percent of GDP) in the form of either government loans or equity(-like) injections. Only the equity(-like) injections would reduce insolvency risks—and, further, they would reduce the share of jobs at risk by almost 3 percentage points relative to panel 1 of Figure 1.3.1.3 This benefit comes at the cost of greater fiscal risks, particularly if firms still end up defaulting, given that equity(-like) claims would then be junior to debt claims. Overall, rising risks and the associated drag on the recovery make a case for extending support to firms for longer and for equity(-like) interventions—at least in countries with available fiscal space. For larger firms, options include direct equity injections or junior debt claims together with warrants, for example. For SMEs, combining grants with a temporarily higher future 3Both types of policy imply a cash transfer of a similar amount and thereby are equally effective at easing liquidity risks. corporate tax rate would act like an equity injection; such an approach could raise tax administration chal- lenges and would need to be carefully calibrated. All these options would entail larger fiscal risks, however, given that equity-like injections into SMEs may attract not only viable firms but also those that are unviable and gambling for resurrection.

This is consistent with past experience immediately following epidemics. However, unrest was high and rising before the COVID-19 crisis started. As the crisis passes, unrest may yet reemerge in countries where progress on underlying social and political issues has stalled and where the crisis exposes or exacerbates preexisting problems. Social unrest has fallen markedly as lockdowns and social distancing have been introduced. The Reported Social Unrest Index (RSUI), which counts media reports of social unrest, has fallen dramatically since March 2020.1 The frequency of major unrest events— defined by country-specific spikes in the RSUI—fell to its lowest in almost five years. The decline in social unrest corresponds closely with a generalized decline in mobility driven by regulations, such as shelter-in-place orders and voluntary social distancing, as shown in Figure 1.4.1 (in line with the findings of Chapter 2). Notable exceptions include the United States, where protests against police violence grew rapidly at the start of June (Figure 1.4.2), and Lebanon.2 Before the COVID-19 outbreak, unrest had been rising for several years. Late 2019 and early 2020 saw major protests, most notably in the Middle East and South America but also elsewhere, including in Belarus, Bolivia, Chile, France, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, India, Iran, and Iraq. This was the continuation of a longer trend since 2016 (Fig- ure 1.4.1), which itself reversed a gradual decline in unrest following a peak after the Arab Spring of 2011. Historically, countries with more epidemics expe- rience more frequent unrest. Table 1.4.1. presents cross-sectional evidence on the number of social unrest events and epidemics since 1990. Data on epidemics are from EM-DAT, a database reporting information on the timing and location of more than 1,200 country-year epidemic events since 1990. The results show a positive and statistically significant cross-country relationship between the two variables. This result holds within regions and is robust for both the frequency and severity of epidemics. The authors of this box are Philip Barrett and Sophia Chen. Luisa Calixto provided research assistance. 1The RSUI is a measure of social unrest constructed from media reports. Details about the index and how it can be used to identify major events are discussed in Barrett and others (2020). 2That media reports reacted strongly in the US case is also evidence that this approach still captures protests despite other newsworthy events. However, this cross-sectional relationship is likely not causal. For example, common factors, such as geography or income level, may lead to more unrest and more or more serious epidemics. To explore this possibility, Table 1.4.2. presents results from a dynamic panel regression.3 This accounts for some of the common drivers, including country- and time-specific effects and recent protests. The results show very weak 3Specifically, the linear probability model: ​​y​ i,t​​ = ​α​ i​​ + ​η​ t​​ + ​∑ j=1 ​ n ​​ ​β​ j​​ ​x​ i,t​ j ​ + ​γ´z​ i,t​​ + ​e​ i,t​​ ,​in which ​​y​ i,t​​​is an indicator for a social unrest event in country i in year t, ​​α​ i​​​and ​​η​ t​​​ are country and time fixed effects,​​x​ i,t​ j ​​is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 if the latest disaster occurred j periods prior (in practice we group past lags together to improve power), and ​​z​ i,t​​​is a vector of controls. Nonlinear models are avoided to admit a wide battery of country and time fixed effects. Barrett and others (2020) shows that recent social unrest both domestically and in neigh- boring countries is correlated with higher future social unrest, so these are included as controls. This short-term analysis does not preclude longer-term effects of epidemics on unrest, such as those identified in the October 2020 Asia and Pacific Regional Economic Outlook.

On the contrary, in any given country, the likelihood of social unrest drops slightly following epidemics (see especially specifications 2 and 3). The COVID-19 experience so far is consistent with this historical pattern. Recent history also includes few examples of unrest obviously caused by epidemics. Concerns over public health have rarely been a primary driver of major episodes of social unrest in the past two decades, despite numerous (often viral) epidemics during this period. While specific demands vary, the purported motives of protesters in events as diverse as the Arab Spring of 2011, unrest in Latin America in late 2019, anti-austerity protests in Europe following the Great Recession, and a variety of episodes in Asia are all at least superficially related to dissatisfaction about social or political issues, not public health. At the same time, several major public health crises have occurred, albeit of smaller scale than the COVID-19 episode, including SARS (2002–04), the H5N1 avian flu (2003–present), the H1N1 swine flu (2009–10), MERS (2012–present), and the West African Ebola epidemic (2013–16). Several factors may explain the lack of a short-term link from epidemics to unrest. Humanitarian crises likely impede the communication and transportation needed to organize major protests. Public opinion may favor cohesion and solidary in times of duress. Or incumbent regimes may take advantage of an emer- gency to consolidate power and suppress dissent. Unrest is likely to reemerge as the pandemic eases. This analysis shows that unrest was elevated before the COVID-19 crisis began but has declined as the crisis has continued. It is reasonable to expect that, as the crisis fades, unrest may reemerge in locations where it previously existed, not because of the COVID-19 crisis per se, but simply because underlying social and political issues have not been tackled. The threats may also be bigger where the crisis exposes or exacerbates problems, such as a lack of trust in institutions, poor governance, poverty, or inequality.4 4A large body of literature discusses how such factors can lead to political instability (Alesina and Perotti 1996) and civil conflicts (surveyed by Blattman and Miguel 2010).

This reflects two distinct phases: between February and April the index fell by 24 percent as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified; between April and August the index recovered by about 31 percent, as many countries eased lockdown mea- sures and economic activity resumed. The rebound, however, has varied across commodities, depending on conditions in end-use sectors and regions affected by the outbreak and on the storability and supply elasticity of a commodity. Prices of energy and some agricultural raw materials rebounded later than metals’ prices. Food prices were less affected, even though changes were widely dispersed across agricultural commodities. This special feature also includes an in-depth analysis of coal. Energy Prices Recovered after April Oil prices declined by 60 percent between February and April 2020 as the pandemic led to a collapse in global oil demand and concerns about storage capacity (see Figure 1.SF.2). In March OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Russia and other non-OPEC oil exporters) could not agree on supply cuts to restore order to the market, but as the oil price fall intensified, in mid-April the cartel decided to curb production by 9.7 million barrels a day in May and June (later extended until July) by 7.7 million barrels a day until December 2020 and by 5.8 million barrels a day until April 2022. US crude oil producers were also hurt as the front-month futures price for the West Texas Intermediate blend briefly went to –$37 in April. Protracted low oil prices led to shut-ins, sharply reduced drilling activity, and a surge in US shale pro- ducer bankruptcy filings. This resulted in an unprece- dented 2 million barrel a day decrease in US crude oil production in May 2020. Thanks to supply reductions, from late April onward, oil prices recovered from the mid-$10s to more than $40 a barrel by early June, but into August they remained about $25 below early January prices. As a result, many oil firms have suffered large losses, All commodities Energy Food Metals Futures 68 percent conﬁdence interval 86 percent conﬁdence interval 95 percent conﬁdence interval Aluminum Copper Iron ore Nickel April 2019 WEO October 2019 WEO April 2020 WEO October 2020 WEO Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P.; IMF, Primary Commodity Price System; Reﬁnitiv Datastream; and IMF staff estimates.

On the demand side, the COVID-19 outbreak drove oil prices sharply down as travel restrictions strongly reduced global demand for liquid fuels in the first half of 2020. On one hand, road traffic has recovered in many countries (see Figure 1.SF.3); on the other hand, air traffic volume—especially international flights—remains subdued. As a result, the International Energy Agency expects oil demand for this year to be down by 8.1 million barrels a day, to 91.9 million bar- rels a day, and to rebound by 5.2 million barrels a day in 2021—a significant revision up from –9.3 million barrels a day for 2020 in its April forecast. In the natural gas market, spot prices have hov- ered around record lows in recent months amid large inventories left in place after a mild winter, weak demand, and subdued oil prices. This led oil producers to burn off large amounts of unwanted natural gas as a byproduct of oil extraction—equivalent to 400 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2019, the most since 2009, according to the World Bank. In late August natural gas prices increased due to an expected rise in winter demand, supply uncertainty in Asia, and technical trading patterns. Competing with natural gas for electricity generation, coal has also experienced significant downward price pressure, although supply disruptions in South Africa and strong demand from Indian industrial buyers supported South African coal prices, while Australian prices have been depressed by China’s apparent tightening of import restrictions and by Japan’s intention to phase out inefficient coal-fired power plants by 2030 (see the section on coal). As of early September, oil futures contracts indi- cate that Brent prices will increase to $50 by the end of 2023, highlighting near-term demand concerns (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 2). Baseline assumptions, also based on futures prices, suggest average annual prices of $41.7 a barrel in 2020—a decrease of 32 percent from the 2019 average—and $46.7 a barrel in 2021 for the IMF’s average petroleum spot prices. Currently, the oil market is characterized by elevated uncertainty as the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet under con- trol (Figure 1.SF.1, panels 2 and 3). Risks, however, are broadly balanced. Upside risks to prices include escalating geopolitical events in the Middle East and faster containment of the pandemic as well as excessive cuts in oil and gas upstream investments and further bankruptcies in the energy sector.

Other downside risks for oil prices include stronger oil production growth in several non-OPEC+ coun- tries, a faster normalization of Libya’s oil production, and a breakdown of the OPEC+ agreement. In the medium and long term, global policy actions to lower CO2 emissions present a further downside risk to oil demand (see Box 1.SF.1). Metal Prices Recovered amid an Uncertain Economic Outlook Base metal prices increased by 18.2 percent between February and August 2020. Slow global industrial activity weighed heavily on prices in the first quarter of 2020 (see Figure 1.SF.4). Since then, supply disrup- tions in mining related to COVID-19 and a resurgence in industrial activity in China—which accounts for half of base metal demand—have helped metal prices return to pre-pandemic levels. Unprecedented stim- ulus measures and a stock market surge also boosted sentiment toward metals. Precious metal prices continued to rise due to increasing demand for safe-haven assets amid concerns that a second wave of COVID-19 infections would cause protracted mone- tary policy stimulus. Among base metals, iron ore prices increased the most between February and August, by 37.0 percent, reaching a year high, while copper prices increased by 14.4 percent amid growing optimism over China’s economic recovery, falling inventories, and supply dis- ruptions in key producing countries (Chile and Peru). Aluminum (+3.0 percent), whose supply has been more insulated from the pandemic as it is mostly sourced domestically, did not rally as global automotive sales slumped. The price of nickel and cobalt, key inputs for stainless steel and batteries in electric vehicles, increased by 14.6 percent and fell by 1.9 percent, respectively. The IMF annual base metal price index is projected to increase by 0.8 percent on an annual average basis in 2020 and by a further 3.0 percent in 2021 on con- cerns surrounding the long-term impact of the pan- demic. The possibility of a second wave of COVID-19, the sustainability of strong China demand, and tensions between China and the United States are the major risks to metal prices falling. These more than offset the risk of supply disruptions in major metal-producing countries. The precious metals index is expected to increase by 28.4 percent in 2020 and by 10.4 percent in 2021 due to the effects of heightened global uncertainty and continued accommodative monetary policies. Food Prices Declined amid Ample Global Supplies The IMF’s food and beverage price index increased by 0.7 percent, reflecting pandemic-induced changes in demand and supply conditions, with different effects on food prices depending on the region and the agri- cultural commodity. As COVID-19 slowed economic activity, demand for agricultural raw materials and ani- mal feed initially declined. Prices of most staple crops, including wheat, maize, soybeans, and palm oil, have been stable or have declined since the beginning of the pandemic due to large global supplies and the initial collapse of crude oil prices (see Figure 1.SF.4). Led by pork, the meat price index fell by 7.1 percent from the April baseline. Amplified by large seasonal farm supply, wholesale pork prices declined by 4.5 percent as several meat processing facilities in the United States closed after employees were infected Energy Base metals and raw materials Agriculture Precious metals Sources: Argus; Bloomberg L.P.; IMF, Primary Commodity Price System; Thomson Reuters Datastream; and IMF staff calculations.

The resulting drop in processing capacity reduced supply to retail channels and drove a wedge between wholesale and retail prices, which generally increased.1 The wholesale price decline spilled over to other meats and seafood, which saw similar downward trends. Staple food prices, such as for wheat and rice rallied, initially driven by consumer stockpiling, but, given ample supply, as the initial surge in demand passed, prices retrenched. Overall, though, the price of rice is still up by 12.6 percent. Corn prices plummeted by 13.0 percent on ethanol demand destruction, with prices reaching a 10-year low in May. Soybean prices declined by 13.0 percent beginning in February on account of ample global supplies, nothwithstanding the fact that China ramped up buying in June as part of the 2020 US-China trade deal. Food prices are projected to increase slightly, by 0.4 percent year over year in 2020 and then increase 4.3 percent in the year thereafter on tighter supply conditions (meats, for example), in part related to expected delays in the supply chain. Further supply chain disruptions and export restrictions in large food exporters are a significant source of upside risk. Renewed tensions between the United States and China could disrupt food trade and lower US food prices while increasing them in competing exporters. Coal: Past, Present, and Future Many countries are taking steps to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels, especially coal, as they seek to pursue a more sustainable future. Because of its high carbon intensity, coal accounts for just under half of global CO2 emissions and nearly three-quarters of all power sector CO2 emissions. In the absence of pollution mitigation systems, it contributes to local air pollution, with potentially severe damaging effects on human health (Smith, Mehta, and Maeusezahl-Feuz 2004). The unprecedented drop in electricity demand in 2020 favored renewables over traditional fossil fuel sources, such as coal and natural gas. In Europe, where electricity consumption fell by more than 10 percent in April, the share of coal (fossil fuels) in power generation declined to 1The harmonized consumer price subindex for food and nonal- coholic beverages, for instance, increased by 4.5 percent between February and June in the United States and by 1.3 percent in the euro area. In China, on the other hand, the food consumer price subindex fell by 9.7 percent. below 8 (30) percent—a historical low. As electricity demand recovered, use of coal resumed globally. So why is coal still popular if it has large negative externalities? Which economies and economic sectors are most dependent on coal? Some countries moved away from coal in the past. How did they do it, and is this replicable? Will the pandemic speed or slow the demise of coal? These questions are explored by looking at the use of coal throughout history, until the recent pandemic, and its trends in production and consumption across countries. Coal Usage, Industrialization, and Energy Transition to Fossil Fuels The Heydays The use of coal took off during the industrial revolu- tion in 18th century England and then spread to con- tinental Europe and the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries. A series of technological inno- vations (including the steam engine and coal-fueled furnaces for steel production) radically transformed manufacturing, coal mining, and transportation (for example, steam locomotives and steamships). This spurred rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization, which drastically increased demand. The transition to coal in Europe also helped reverse a pat- tern of excessive deforestation from centuries of inten- sive wood harvesting—a major energy transition that saw industrial economies moving away from biomass (that is, wood fuel).2,3 Hence, until the early interwar period, coal consumption and its share in the energy mix grew unabated in almost every country. Decline and Renaissance During the 1930s and especially after World War II cleaner fossil fuel alternatives—such as oil and, later, natural gas—increasingly displaced coal in the trans- portation, residential, and commercial sectors and even in power generation (Figure 1.SF.5). Coal, especially the low-grade sulfurous variety, was cheap but a major 2Indeed, forest cover in Europe today is higher than it has been in a century (Fuchs and others 2015). Afforestation notwithstand- ing, primeval forests in western Europe are extremely rare. For a vivid depiction of a preindustrial Italian forest, see “Hunting in the Pontine Marshes” by Horace Vernet (1833). 3Similarly, the rise of the American oil industry in the 19th century helped save several whale species from extinction as kerosene lamps quickly displaced whale oil lamps and candles in the 19th century. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-65-2048.jpg) ![47International Monetary Fund | October 2020 Special Feature Commodity Market Developments and Forecasts cause of air pollution and environmental damage.4 Hence, per capita coal consumption, and especially the coal share in the energy mix, declined rapidly—and was further pushed down by the expanding motor vehicle industry’s thirst for gasoline. That coal decline was surprisingly interrupted in the 1970s and then partially reversed by three significant factors (Figure 1.SF.5): (1) energy security concerns (because of the twin oil shocks of the 1970s), (2) the growing electrification of energy end-uses, and (3) fast economic growth in emerging markets. The combina- tion of (1) and (2) contributed to increased demand for coal for power generation in many advanced econo- mies that wanted to reduce dependence on oil because of energy security concerns.5 Later, at the turn of the 4During the Great Smog of London (December 5–9, 1952), due to weather conditions, air pollutants from the combustion of coal and diesel-powered buses for public transportation covered the city in a blanket of smog.

Today, the top five coal-consuming countries (China, India, United States, Russia, Japan) account for 76.7 percent of global coal consumption (Figure 1.SF.7). China accounts for about half of global coal consump- tion after industrial and power generation coal demand grew particularly fast in the mid-2000s following an infrastructure boom. In fact, today, driven by China, emerging markets, where industry coal demand is still important, account for the lion’s share—76.8 percent— of coal consumption. Globally, industry takes about 20 percent of total coal consumption (Table 1.SF.1). In advanced economies, coal demand is predominantly associated with power generation because of the decline of 6China and India increasingly relied on coal to satisfy their rising energy needs as economic activity accelerated (Steckel, Edenhofer, and Jakob 2015).

Given that the electrification of economic systems is ongoing, energy demand from power generation is expected to increase in advanced economies, where total energy demand is flattening.7 Whereas no significant economical alternatives to coking coal exist in the industrial sector (for example, in making steel and cement), low-carbon alter- natives compete with coal for investment in new power plants. This is more relevant in emerging markets, where power generation capacity is expected to grow the most. Coal’s Negative Externalities: Health, Environment, and Carbon Emissions Coal-fired thermal power plants release several substances—including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, and mercury—into the air and rivers, streams, and lakes. These emissions are hazardous to human health (toxins) and degrade the environment (pollutants).8 Air pollution from the 7There has been a steady increase in the role of electricity as energy service provider. In 2017 power generation accounted for about 41 percent of total energy demand, up from 26 percent in 1971. 8Emissions from coal combustion can damage the respiratory, cardio- vascular, and nervous systems of the human body (Smith, Mehta, and Maeusezahl-Feuz 2004). combustion of coal and other fossil fuels was long considered the most serious environmental prob- lem in advanced economies.9 In Europe and the United States, for example, regulations were rolled out beginning in the 1980s and 1990s to incentivize the adoption of environmental pollution mitigation technologies, such as scrubbers, thereby curtailing emissions from coal plants.10 Other countries decided to (slowly) steer away from the use of coal altogether, with nuclear, hydropower, natural gas, and—more recently—renewable energy slowly displacing coal. Though steps have been taken to mitigate coal’s direct environmental impact, the combustion of coal also emits CO2. Coal is more carbon intense than any other primary energy fuel. This means that replacing coal with other energy sources decarbonizes the energy system, and the degree to which that happens depends on the substitute. To rank energy sources by carbon intensity, their emission factors can be compared, expressed in tons of CO2 per unit of electricity generated, which considers both the intrinsic carbon intensity of the fuel per unit of energy and the average efficiency of the generation technology. When burned to generate both heat and elec- tricity, coal is 2.2 times as carbon intense as natural gas— the only realistic fossil fuel alternative in the power sector (Figure 1.SF.8). With its high emission factor and large share in world energy consumption, coal contributes about 44 percent of all CO2 emissions and 72 percent of all power sector emissions (Figure 1.SF.9).11 9According to Fouquet (2011), by 1880 the mining, transporta- tion, and combustion of coal in the British economy had imposed external damages close to 20 percent of GDP. 10An important milestone in this context has been the United Nations Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, the first treaty to deal with air pollution on a regional basis, which entered into force in 1983. 11According to the International Energy Agency, the share of energy in total greenhouse gas emissions was 74.2 percent in 2015. The remainder constitutes greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, deforestation, and land conversion more broadly.

With the introduction and rise of new energy sources, especially after World War II, the energy mix in many countries broadened and they became less dependent on coal. Currently, per capita coal consumption has already peaked in 73 out of the 84 countries whose share of coal in total energy consumption at some point crossed 5 percent. Irre- spective of their absolute dependence reached at peak consumption, the average annual decline across these countries was 2.3 percent between 1971 and 2017 (Figure 1.SF.10). This implies that it takes, on average, 43 years to phase out coal after the peak in coal con- sumption per capita has been reached. Contrasting the energy mix of countries across income groups reveals stark differences (Table 1.SF.2). Poor countries rely primarily on biomass for their energy needs, while middle-income countries have a strong dependence on coal.12 At high incomes, the coal share in energy decreases as nuclear and natural gas options grow. The quality ladder hypothesis may help explain the observed relationship between income and the 12See the relationship between income level and biomass con- sumption in Chapter 1 of the October 2018 WEO. energy mix. The hypothesis states that as income rises, energy sources are chosen not just for affordability and availability but increasingly for their efficiency, convenience, low environmental impact, and safety.13 Biofuels occupy the low rungs of that ladder; coal, oil, and hydro the middle rungs; and capital-intensive sources, such as nuclear, natural gas, and renewables, the upper rungs. The low price of coal-fired power gen- eration (Figure 1.SF.11) is consistent with the notion that coal plays an important role in the energy mix of lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries as an affordable and often abundant energy source (Table 1.SF.2).14,15 Country-specific endowments of competing energy sources, such as hydropower potential, could also influence the attractiveness of coal during different stages of development. 13See Stokey (1998) for a theory model on demand for environ- mental quality. 14Even today, the marginal cost of operating a coal-fired power plant is one of the lowest. The cost of wind and solar has substan- tially declined at the plant level, but a full ramp-up of renewables in the electricity grid faces decreasing returns due to their intermittency. 15A common way to compare alternative options for electrical energy production is the levelized cost of electricity, which is defined as the present value of the price of the produced electrical energy (usually expressed in units of cents per kilowatt-hour), considering the economic life of the plant and the costs incurred in the construc- tion, operation and maintenance, and fuel costs.

The analysis controls for country-specific factors, including the share of manufacturing in nominal value added, coal reserves per capita, and hydropower potential (see Online Annex I, available at www​.imf​.org/​en/​ Publications/​WEO, for a more detailed discussion). Results strongly support the presence of an inverse U-shaped relationship between income and the share of coal in the energy mix, with coal attaining its maximum share at an income level of $9,600 per capita—that is, when a country reaches upper-middle-income status. For example, our main specification predicts that, between 1971 and 2017, income per capita contributed to reductions in the coal share of 6.4 percentage points in the United States and 5.2 percentage points in Japan and to increases of 12.2 percentage points in India and 11.3 percentage points in China. Results also show that energy endowments, such as hydropower and coal reserves, play a quantitatively important role—more so than manufacturing and environmental regulation, for which modest effects are found. Harsher winters are also associated with higher use of coal. Like the relationship between the coal share and income, the relationship between coal consump- tion per capita and income is highly nonlinear. The preferred specification shows an S-shape relationship with income per capita: at low income levels, coal consumption growth accelerates, reaches its max- imum at the middle income level, and then levels off. The turning point of absolute coal dependence, after which coal consumption declines, ranges from $35,000 to $39,000. Contrasting the turning points of the two different measures of coal dependence leads to the finding that the “share (or relative) turning point” occurs before the “per capita (or absolute) turning point.” At middle and high income levels coal is indeed increasingly succeeded by faster-growing and higher-quality fuels, such as oil, nuclear, and natural gas, causing its share in the energy mix to decline. However, coal consump- tion per capita continues to grow after that (albeit at a slower pace than some other energy sources) to satisfy fast-growing energy demand. Assuming income per capita growth of 4 percent a year, it takes another 33 years to get from the share turning point to the United States Germany France United Kingdom Reduction in 2017 since peak Sources: International Energy Agency; and IMF staff calculations.

These findings are consis- tent with the idea that new energy fuels only slowly displace old energy fuels. Combining estimates of the average speed of decline and the estimated time interval between the peaks in relative and absolute coal dependence, it takes, on average, 76 years to phase out coal once it reaches its largest share in the energy mix. For the United Kingdom, which is on the verge of eliminat- ing coal, it took almost 100 years to accomplish that feat (Figure 1.SF.10). For China, whose coal share peaked in 2013, it implies at least another 38 years of coal consumption under business-as-usual condi- tions. Still, the United Kingdom shows the relevance of policy actions, stimulated by the introduction of carbon pricing at the utility level; the United Kingdom experienced one of the fastest declines in coal usage between 2013 and 2018 as coal was replaced by natu- ral gas (Table 1.SF.3).16 In the United States, instead, 16In 2013 the United Kingdom became the first country in the European Union to introduce a carbon price support—a tax paid by companies that generate electricity from fossil fuels that tops Europe’s emissions trading system, through which energy companies buy permits to emit carbon dioxide. The tax was initially set at £9 a metric ton of CO2 and gradually doubled to £18. a similar, but more modest, decline was driven by market forces as the shale gas revolution pushed down natural gas prices. The fastest recent transitions away from coal have been driven by natural gas, at times helped by renewables (Table 1.SF.3). Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp reduction in coal consumption in many coal consumer countries (see Chapter 3). Given that renewables’ marginal costs are extremely low, natural gas and coal accounted for most of the decline in electricity generation leading, in some regions, to record-high renewables shares in electricity production (Figure 1.SF.12). However, it is too early to declare “mission accomplished.” First, the downward pres- sure on natural gas prices was even stronger than on coal, in part because of lack of storage for natural gas (Figure 1.SF.13). Second, where electricity demand recovered, coal usage resumed. These considerations and the previous examples and econometric analysis suggest that a full coal phaseout will occur long after low-carbon energy sources start to gain importance in the energy mix. There are two main reasons for this persistence. First, industrial use of coal is hard to replace with other energy sources and still represents 33 percent of coal consumption in emerg- ing markets, where most industrial sector coal usage is concentrated. Second, and most important, coal-fired power plants are long-lived assets with a minimum design lifespan of 30–40 years. This makes the obso- lescence rate of a recently built coal-fired power plant very low without either large changes in the levelized cost of electricity for renewables or policy intervention. The pandemic and its effects on economic activity are changing the medium-term outlook for coal and coal-fired power plants in various ways but, overall, Source: Lazard 2019.

On one hand, if the reduction in electricity demand turns out to be more permanent, this would likely reduce the utilization of existing coal-fired power plants, encouraging their closure, especially in advanced economies. On the other hand, in emerging markets, even if electricity demand does not fully recover to trends before the pandemic, it is still expected to grow strongly. A possible reduction in coal prices, coupled with lower wholesale electricity prices, may slow investment in renewables, to the ben- efit of coal, in the absence of policy intervention. Finally, it is worth noting that, in contrast to studies examining total energy consumption, a large part of the variation in coal dependence is unexplained.17 In part, this may reflect political economy factors leading to cross-country differences in energy policies. In some countries the value of coal reserves is multiples of GDP, raising the risk of stranded coal assets. Strong domestic mining interests in large coal consumer and producer countries, especially in Asia, including China and India, may further complicate and delay 17See the Commodity Special Feature of the October 2018 WEO for an analysis of energy demand. the phaseout of coal in major coal consumer-producer countries (see Online Annex II for more detailed discussion). Conclusions Reducing carbon emissions from coal would go a long way toward fighting climate change. Furthermore, decarbonization of the power generation sector would amplify the benefits of a global transition to electric vehicles and electric mobility more broadly—given that electric vehicles would be charged with low-carbon electricity. Moving away from coal usually starts in high-income nations and takes decades to complete. The pandemic may have dented coal consumption but, probably, only temporarily. Moreover, countries that have recently, or not yet, seen per capita coal consump- tion peak (including China, India, and Indonesia) account for the lion’s share of global coal consump- tion, which will therefore take years to decline in the absence of significant policy actions.

Although carbon-capture and storage technology may be a viable solution, in the absence of substantial carbon pricing, it is currently expensive to retrofit existing plants or build new coal plants with such technology (see IMF 2019 for a detailed analysis of the benefits of carbon pricing). Furthermore, some claim that the CO2 emission opportunity costs of further investment in carbon capture and storage may be large, as proven technologies, such as wind and solar, can already be used to lower carbon emissions (see, for example, Jacobson 2020). It may be wise, however, to diversify and invest in multiple mitigation strategies, as the intermittency problem of renewables, especially for a high degree of grid penetration, remains unsolved and may still require coal for power generation in some locations. The decline in coal could be accelerated if govern- ments were willing to compensate the losers from a coal phaseout and see the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate it. In emerging markets, the degree to which coal is locked in can be minimized if capital constraints are reduced to favor investment in renewables. The international community can provide financial and technical assistance (on how to build grids with the intermittent electricity generated by renewables) and limit funding of new coal plants, at least where alternatives are available. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-72-2048.jpg) ![54 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent International Monetary Fund | October 2020 This box updates the assessment of global carbon emissions from the October 2019 World Economic Outlook. Latest data for the end of 2019 show that the growth in global carbon emissions fell to below 0.5 percent, after an alarming rebound in 2017 and 2018 of more than 2 percent (Figure 1.SF.1.1). China remains a key driver of emission growth, and its impact picked up again in 2019, after a period of gradual regression. India and other emerging markets’ contribution in 2019 fell substantially, and emissions decreased in all Group of Seven economies. The decline in global emissions in 2019 can be attributed mainly to a fall in energy intensity and The authors of this box are Claire Li and Nico Valckx. lower income growth (Figure 1.SF.1.2).1 This is consis- tent with previous years and likely reflects the cyclical slowdown in global industrial production in 2019. Decarbonization remained an important mitigation force in 2019 as wind, solar, and natural gas continued to replace coal as the energy source of choice in the power sectors of all major emitters. In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns will likely lead emissions to fall, although most of the reduction will likely be short-lived when normal economic growth returns. Policymakers should thus seize the crisis as an opportunity to invest in greener growth that permanently lowers emissions (Georgieva 2020). 1The October 2019 World Economic Outlook shows that total emissions can be expressed as a product of carbon intensity (carbon emissions per unit of energy), energy intensity (energy per unit of GDP), GDP per capita, and human population.

Meanwhile, economic activity contracted dramatically on a global scale. This chapter aims to dissect the nature of the economic crisis in the first seven months of the pandemic. It finds that the adoption of lockdowns was an important factor in the recession, but voluntary social distancing in response to rising infections also contributed very substantially to the economic contraction. Therefore, although easing lockdowns can lead to a partial recovery, economic activity is likely to remain subdued until health risks abate. Meanwhile, countries should protect the most vulnerable and find ways to support economic activity compatible with social distancing, for example, by reducing contact intensity in the workplace and enhancing work from home where possible. This chapter also provides new evidence of the uneven effects of lockdowns, which are found to have a larger impact on the mobility of women and younger cohorts. This calls for targeted policy action to prevent a widening of inequality. Finally, the analysis shows that lockdowns can substantially reduce COVID-19 infections, especially if they are introduced early in a country’s epidemic and are sufficiently tight. Thus, despite involving short-term economic costs, lockdowns may pave the way to a faster recovery by containing the spread of the virus and reducing the need for voluntary social distancing over time, possibly having positive overall effects on the economy. This remains an important area for future research as new data become available. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has raised unprece- dented health challenges on a global scale. To contain the spread of the virus, most countries have resorted to stringent lockdown measures, closing schools and business activities and sometimes even preventing The authors of this chapter are Francesca Caselli, Francesco Grigoli (co-lead), Weicheng Lian, and Damiano Sandri (co-lead), with support from Jungjin Lee and Xiaohui Sun. The chapter benefited from insightful comments by Yuriy Gorodnichenko and internal seminar participants. people from leaving their homes, except for essential reasons. Meanwhile, economic activity has contracted dramatically, as discussed in Chapter 1. No country was spared, with GDP declining sharply in advanced, emerging market, and developing economies. This chapter’s first goal is to shed light on the extent to which the economic contraction was driven by the adoption of government lockdowns instead of by people voluntarily reducing social interactions for fear of contracting or spreading the virus. This issue is important to understand retrospectively the nature of the recession and to provide insights into the strength of the upcoming recovery. If lockdowns were largely responsible for the economic contraction, it would be reasonable to expect a quick economic rebound when they are lifted. But if voluntary social distancing played a predominant role, then economic activity would likely remain subdued until health risks recede. The analysis starts by examining the cross-country association between lockdowns and economic activ- ity across a broad sample of countries. It finds that countries that endured more stringent lockdowns experienced larger growth declines relative to pre– COVID-19 forecasts, even after controlling for the severity of the local epidemic. The chapter then assesses the impact of lockdowns using high-frequency proxies for economic activity, namely mobility indica- tors provided by Google and job postings provided by the website Indeed.1 Regression results show that lock- downs have a considerable negative effect on economic activity. Nonetheless, voluntary social distancing in response to rising COVID-19 infections can also have strong detrimental effects on the economy. In fact, the analysis suggests that lockdowns and voluntary social distancing played a near comparable role in 1Google Community Mobility Reports provide information on daily attendance rates at various locations relative to precrisis levels.

THE GREAT LOCKDOWN: DISSECTING THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS2 CHAPTER ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-84-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 66 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 driving the economic recession. The contribution of voluntary distancing in reducing mobility was stronger in advanced economies, where people can work from home more easily and sustain periods of temporary unemployment because of personal savings and gov- ernment benefits. When looking at the recovery path ahead, the importance of voluntary social distancing as a con- tributing factor to the downturn suggests that lifting lockdowns is unlikely to rapidly bring economic activity back to potential if health risks remain. This is true especially if lockdowns are lifted when infec- tions are still relatively high because, in those cases, the impact on mobility appears more modest. Further tempering the expectations of a quick economic rebound, the analysis documents that easing lock- downs tends to have a positive effect on mobility, but the impact is weaker than that of tightening lock- downs. These findings suggest that economies will continue to operate below potential while health risks persist, even if lockdowns are lifted. Therefore, policy- makers should be wary of removing policy support too quickly and consider ways to protect the most vulnerable and support economic activity consistent with social distancing. These may include measures to reduce contact intensity and make the workplace safer, for example by promoting contactless payments; facilitating a gradual reallocation of resources toward less-contact-intensive sectors; and enhancing work from home, for example, by improving internet con- nectivity and supporting investment in information technology. The chapter also contributes to the growing empirical evidence on the uneven effects of the crisis, with particularly acute impacts on more economi- cally vulnerable people. Using novel anonymized and aggregated mobility indicators provided by Vodafone for some European countries, the analysis shows that lockdowns tend to have a larger effect on women’s mobility than on men’s, especially at the time of school closures.2 This suggests that women carry a disproportionate burden in caring for children, which 2These indicators were prepared by Vodafone’s Big Data and Artificial Intelligence team and were provided for the analysis in an anomymized format through a confidential agreement. To protect the privacy of individuals and minority groups, mobility indices were aggregated at the provincial level, including at least 50 customers. The data sharing protocol was subject to technical and organizational controls, including an ethical assessment of the analysis prior to its implementation. may jeopardize their employment opportunities. Vodafone data also show that lockdowns tend to have a stronger impact on the mobility of younger cohorts, who are economically more vulnerable because they generally rely on labor income and have less stable jobs. Thus, targeted policy intervention is needed to protect the employment prospects of women and younger cohorts and prevent a widening of income inequality. Finally, the chapter finds that lockdowns can reduce infections substantially. The effects of lock- downs on confirmed COVID-19 cases tend to materialize after a few weeks of delay, given the incubation period of the virus and testing times. This underscores the importance of early intervention, also because lockdowns are more effective in curbing infections if they are introduced early in the stage of a country’s epidemic. The analysis also suggests that lockdowns must be sufficiently stringent to reduce infections significantly. The effectiveness of lockdowns in reducing infec- tions suggests that lockdowns may pave the way to a faster economic recovery if they succeed in containing the epidemic and thus limit the extent of voluntary social distancing. Therefore, the short-term economic costs of lockdowns could be compensated by stronger medium-term growth, possibly leading to positive overall effects on the economy. This is an important area for future research. Meanwhile, policymakers should also pursue alternative ways to contain infec- tions that may involve lower short-term economic costs than lockdowns, such as expanding testing and contact tracing, promoting the use of face masks, and encouraging work from home. As the understanding of the virus transmission improves, countries may also be able to deploy targeted measures rather than blunt lockdowns, for example by focusing on pro- tecting vulnerable people and restricting large indoor gatherings. The analysis contributes to a rapidly growing liter- ature on the pandemic and the effects of lockdowns, which is reviewed in Box 2.1. The understanding of the crisis is still evolving—some papers detect consid- erable effects of lockdowns while others emphasize the role of voluntary social distancing. The literature also documents the pandemic’s uneven effect on vulnera- ble segments of the population and provides evidence of the effectiveness of lockdowns and face masks in containing infections. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-85-2048.jpg) ![CHAPTER 2 THE GREAT LOCKDOWN: DISSECTING THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS 67International Monetary Fund | October 2020 Cross-Country Evidence on Lockdowns and Economic Activity The analysis starts by presenting cross-country evidence on the association between lockdowns and economic activity over a sample of up to 52 advanced, emerging market, and developing economies. Panel 1 of Figure 2.1 shows the correla- tion between the stringency of lockdowns during the first half of 2020 and the decline in GDP relative to pre-pandemic forecasts.3 The figure illustrates that countries that implemented more stringent lock- downs experienced sharper GDP contractions. Panel 2 of Figure 2.1 shows that the negative association between lockdowns and economic activ- ity is robust to using other indicators besides GDP. For example, more stringent lockdowns are associ- ated with lower consumption, investment, indus- trial production, retail sales, purchasing managers’ indices for the manufacturing and service sectors, and higher unemployment rates.4 These correla- tions persist with and without controlling for the strength of each country’s epidemic based on the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases scaled by population. Figure 2.1 thus provides suggestive evidence that lockdowns tend to have a negative short-term economic impact. Nonetheless, these findings should be interpreted with caution given omitted variable concerns that affect cross-country analyses and endogeneity concerns about lockdowns. The decision to deploy lockdowns is indeed not random; rather, it may reflect time-invariant country char- acteristics that also affect economic outcomes. For example, countries with higher social capital may not require stringent lockdowns—as people take greater precautions against infecting others—and could also better withstand the economic impact of the crisis. This may generate a spurious negative correlation between the stringency of lockdowns and economic activity. To strengthen identification by controlling for such time-invariant country charac- teristics, the next section reexamines the economic impact of lockdowns using time-series variation in high-frequency data. 3The analysis uses a lockdown stringency index that averages several subindicators—school closures, workplace closures, cancellations of public events, restrictions on gatherings, public transportation closures, stay-at-home requirements, restrictions on internal movement, and controls on international travel— provided by the University of Oxford’s Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. 4Data for GDP, consumption, and investment refer to the first half of 2020. For the other indicators that are available at monthly frequency, the analysis considers the first three months after the first 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases in each country to compare economic outcomes during the same phase of a country’s epidemic.

First, the analysis uses mobility data provided by Google, which reports the attendance rate at various locations relative to precrisis levels.5 These data have the key advantages of covering a large set of countries and being available also at the subnational level. The findings based on mobility data are corroborated using job posting data reported by Indeed, an online job search engine. Indeed data are available for fewer countries but capture labor market conditions more directly. Lockdowns and Mobility To assess the impact of lockdowns on mobility, the analysis uses local projections that include country fixed effects and time dummies to control for time-invariant country characteristics and global shocks, respectively. It is important to note that lockdowns are endogenous policy choices that depend on the stage of the epidemic and the degree of mobility. For example, governments are more likely to impose lockdowns when health risks become more acute. At the same time, people tend to reduce mobility because they fear contracting the virus, independent of lockdowns. This may lead to a spurious negative correlation between lockdowns and mobility. To alleviate these endogeneity concerns, the regression framework controls for the number of COVID-19 cases and includes lags of the mobility indicator. In other words, the empirical analysis tries to measure the impact on mobility from a lockdown tightening at a given stage of the country’s epidemic. Online Annex 2.3 provides additional details. The regression is estimated using national-level data for 128 countries. Panel 1 of Figure 2.2 shows that lockdowns tend to have a statistically significant nega- tive effect on mobility. A full lockdown that includes all measures that governments have used during the pan- demic—for example, school closures, travel restrictions, business closures, and stay-at-home requirements— tends to generate a reduction in mobility of about 5Data are based on cell phone locations for people who own smartphones and agree to share location data with Google. Because this category of people may have characteristics that differ from those of the broader population—for example, income level, age, or access to the internet—the mobility indices may not be fully repre- sentative of the entire country, especially in poorer countries, where fewer people have smartphones.

Mobility starts to resume gradually after that as the lockdown tightening shock dissipates, as illustrated in Online Annex 2.3.6 To address endogeneity concerns further, the impact of lockdowns is also estimated using subnational data. The analysis considers 15 Group of Twenty coun- tries that imposed national lockdowns in response to severe localized outbreaks and examines the impact on mobility in regions with a relatively low number of COVID-19 cases. This approach strengthens the iden- tification because the adoption of the national lock- down was largely exogenous for regions less affected by the epidemic. As reported in Online Annex 2.3, the results confirm that lockdowns tend to have a strong negative impact on mobility. These findings are robust to controlling for COVID-19 cases at both the regional and national levels. However, lockdowns are not the only contributing factor to the decline in mobility. During a pandemic, people also voluntarily reduce exposure to one another as infections increase and they fear becoming sick. Several papers document this aspect by showing that mobility has been tightly correlated with the spread of COVID-19, even after controlling for government lockdowns, especially in advanced economies (Aum, Lee, and Shin 2020; Goolsbee and Syverson 2020; Maloney and Taskin 2020). In line with this literature, the regression framework used in the analysis can shed light on the strength of voluntary social distancing by capturing the response of mobility to rising COVID-19 infections for a given lockdown stringency.7 Panel 2 of Figure 2.2 shows that an increase in COVID-19 cases tends to have a considerable negative effect on mobil- ity. A doubling of daily cases leads to a contraction in mobility by about 2 percent. 6Online Annex 2.3 also shows that the results are robust to con- trolling for COVID-19 deaths instead of cases; using subindicators of mobility provided by Google; controlling for testing, contact trac- ing, and public information campaigns; and accounting for possible cross-country heterogeneity in the mobility response depending on population density and indicators of governance and social capital. 7Besides reacting to the spread of COVID-19, people may voluntarily opt for social distancing also in response to other factors, such as announcements by public health officials, news about celebrities being infected, or even the adoption of government lockdowns. Therefore, the analysis may underestimate the extent of voluntary social distancing. The results are robust to controlling for COVID-19 deaths instead of cases. Normalizing COVID-19 cases or deaths by population is irrelevant, given that the regressions include country fixed effects and population does not vary during the period of analysis. To gain further insights into the relative impor- tance of lockdowns and voluntary social distancing tied to rising COVID-19 cases, panel 3 of Figure 2.2 shows their contribution in reducing mobility during the first three months of each country’s epidemic. Both lockdowns and voluntary social distancing had a large impact on mobility, playing a roughly sim- ilar role in emerging markets. The contribution of voluntary social distancing was smaller in low-income countries and larger in advanced economies. These differences likely reflect that people in more eco- nomically developed countries can work from home more easily and can even afford to stop working temporarily by relying on personal savings or social security benefits. Conversely, people in low-income countries are often unable to opt for voluntary social distancing as they do not have the financial means to cope with a temporary income loss. This underscores the importance of international support to ensure that low-income countries have budgetary room for expanding safety nets. The large contribution of voluntary social dis- tancing in reducing mobility suggests that lifting lockdowns can lead to only a partial rebound in economic activity if health risks persist. In line with this implication, panel 1 in Figure 2.3 shows that the impact of lockdowns on mobility is smaller when infections are relatively high. A likely reason is that people feel uncomfortable with resum- ing mobility when lockdowns are lifted if they still perceive a considerable risk of contracting or spreading the virus. This insight warns against lifting lockdowns prematurely in hope of jump-starting economic activity. Panel 2 of Figure 2.3 provides additional evidence against expecting a sharp eco- nomic recovery just from easing lockdowns. It shows that easing lockdowns tends to have a positive effect on mobility but the magnitude is weaker compared with the impact from a lockdown tightening. As documented in Online Annex 2.3, this difference is statistically significant. The importance of voluntary social distancing coupled with the modest boost to mobility from easing lockdowns suggest that economies will likely operate below potential as long as health concerns persist.8 A first implication is that policymakers should be 8Given the severity of the downturn, the crisis may have also reduced the level of potential output, thus leading to permanent losses even after the pandemic is over. This is an important issue for future research. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-88-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 70 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 wary of removing policy support too hastily to avoid precipitating a further downturn and should continue to protect the most vulnerable through social safety net spending. Second, it is important to find ways to sup- port economic activity consistent with persistent social distancing. These may include measures to reduce contact intensity and make the workplace safer—for example by promoting contactless payments— and facilitate the reallocation of resources toward less-contact-intensive sectors. Policymakers should also enhance working from home, for example by improv- ing internet access and supporting firm investment in information technology, which, as shown in Box 2.2, can protect employment during the pandemic. Lockdowns and Job Postings The importance of lockdowns and voluntary social distancing in the ongoing crisis can also be examined using the daily number of job postings provided by Indeed for 22 countries. The analysis uses a local projection framework that mimics the one used for the analysis of mobility. Panels 1 and 2 of Figure 2.4 show that a lockdown tightening and an increase in COVID-19 cases both lead to a statistically significant negative effect on job postings, corroborating the find- ings based on mobility. Both lockdowns and volun- tary social distancing in response to higher infections appear to have played an important role in driving the reduction in job postings during the first three months of each country’s epidemic (panel 3). Consistent with the analysis of mobility, the contribution of voluntary social distancing is relatively higher because the coun- try sample includes mostly advanced economies. Data from Indeed can also be disaggregated by job categories, providing additional insights consistent with the results presented so far. First, panel 1 of Figure 2.5 suggests that both lockdowns and voluntary social distancing contributed to the reduction in job postings. Contact-intensive jobs—such as those in the hospitality, personal care, and food sectors—declined before stay-at-home orders, likely because of voluntary social distancing as customers grew wary of infection risks. Job postings in the manufacturing sector—that do not involve personal contacts with customers— instead started to decline closer to the adoption of stay-at-home orders, reflecting the impact of lockdown measures. The figure also shows that job postings in contact-intensive sectors declined more than in the manufacturing sector, likely reflecting a larger drop in aggregate demand because of voluntary social dis- tancing. Second, panel 2 provides evidence consistent with the notion that easing lockdowns is unlikely to generate a sharp rebound in economic activity. The removal of stay-at-home orders has coincided with only a marginal increase in job postings, even in the less-contact-intensive manufacturing sector. The Unequal Effects of Lockdowns across Gender and Age Groups The pandemic is having disproportional effects on the most economically vulnerable segments of the population.

These orders coincided with a large drop in mobility for both men and women, leading to a drop of about 20 per- cent in the number of people who leave their homes on a given day. However, the effect on women was stronger by about 2 percent, a modest but statistically significant difference. Because stay-at-home orders in Italy, Portugal, and Spain coincided with school closures for almost all regions, the higher reduction in women’s mobility may reflect that women are more likely to care for children when schools are closed. Consistent with this hypothesis, data show a smaller difference between men and women for people aged 45 to 64, who are less likely to have young children who require supervision at home. Panel 2 provides additional evidence on women’s role in caring for children. Focusing on a few regions in northern Italy that closed schools two weeks before the national lockdown, mobility data show that the gender gap already widened at the time of school closures. The national stay-at-home order increased the gap further, possibly reflecting higher female employment in contact-intensive sectors (such as retail, tourism, and hospitality) that were closed during the national lockdown. The evidence provided in panels 1 and 2 thus points to a disproportionate effect of lock- down measures on women, calling for targeted policy intervention to support women (by offering parental leave, for example) and to avoid long-lasting effects on their employment opportunities.9 Vodafone data also reveal uneven effects of lock- downs across age groups. Panel 3 shows that the adoption of stay-at-home orders led to a consider- able reduction in mobility across all age categories. Nonetheless, the effects were considerably stronger for younger cohorts. Starting from a higher level of mobility consistent with the need to go to work, working-age people experienced a sharp contraction in mobility around the adoption of stay-at-home orders. The drop was particularly large for people aged 18 to 24 (some of whom, however, are students) and for people aged 25 to 44. The impact was substantially weaker for people aged 65 and above, who generally no longer work and whose level of mobility was already lower before the stay-at-home orders. These findings 9The analysis faces several limitations. For example, the sam- ple is restricted to a few European countries, data do not provide information on the employment status before and after lockdowns, and various other factors can amplify or attenuate gender inequality during the pandemic. These are important areas for future research. Ages 18–24 Ages 25–44 Ages 45–64 Ages 65+ Male Female Male Female Sources: Vodafone; and IMF staff calculations.

Lockdowns and COVID-19 Infections Lockdowns engender sizable short-term economic costs, but they are also an investment in public health to protect susceptible populations from the highly transmissible virus. The analysis now examines the effectiveness of lockdowns in curbing infections. Growth rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases are regressed using local projections over the stringency of lockdowns while controlling for country and time fixed effects as well as other variables that can affect infections, such as outside temperature and humidity, public information campaigns, testing, and contact tracing. Online Annex 2.5 provides additional details. Panel 1 of Figure 2.7 shows that lockdowns tend to have a negative impact on infections. A stringent lockdown leads to a reduction in cumulated infections of about 40 percent after 30 days. Note that the effects of lockdowns on confirmed COVID-19 cases tend to materialize after at least two weeks, consistent with the COVID-19 incubation period and the time required for testing. Acknowledging this aspect is important to properly guide people’s expectations about the effec- tiveness of lockdowns. Furthermore, the lagged impact on infections points to the need to adopt lockdowns before infection rates increase too rapidly. Panels 2 and 3 of Figure 2.7 provide additional evidence of the benefits of adopting lockdowns early in a country’s epidemic. Panel 2 shows the evolution of infections since the first COVID-19 case, differ- entiating countries by the number of days between the first case and the day when lockdown measures reached maximum stringency. Countries that imposed lockdowns faster experienced better epidemiological outcomes. The differences are even more striking if countries are divided with respect to the number of COVID-19 cases at the time of lockdowns (panel 3). 10Even though lockdowns had a stronger impact on the mobility of younger people, older people have suffered disproportionately from the health consequences of COVID-19 whose case-fatality rate is much higher in people aged 65 and above.

The observation that lockdowns can reduce infec- tions but involve short-term economic costs is often used to argue that lockdowns involve a trade-off between saving lives and protecting livelihoods. This narrative should be reconsidered in light of the earlier findings showing that rising infections can also have severe detrimental effects on economic activity. By bringing infections under control, lockdowns may thus pave the way to a faster economic recovery as people feel more comfortable about resuming normal activ- ities. In other words, the short-term economic costs of lockdowns could be compensated through higher future economic activity, possibly even leading to posi- tive net effects on the economy. This remains a crucial area for future research as more data become available. Individual Lockdown Measures and Nonlinear Effects So far, the analysis has used a lockdown stringency index that combines a broad range of underlying measures. These include, for example, travel restric- tions, school and workplace closures, and stay-at-home orders. Disentangling the effects of these measures is an arduous task because they are highly correlated, as countries often introduced them in rapid succession to contain infections. Furthermore, countries have generally followed a similar sequence, from restrictions on international travel to stay-at-home orders, as illus- trated in panel 1 of Figure 2.8. Therefore, the empiri- cal analysis tends to capture the marginal impact of a given measure conditional on those that are already in place. As discussed in Online Annex 2.6, this under- estimates the importance of measures that are adopted at a later stage. For example, stay-at-home orders are found to have a modest impact on mobility because various other measures are already in place. An analytically sounder approach is to examine whether further tightening of lockdown measures continues to have similar economic and epidemiolog- ical effects. This can inform policymakers on whether it is best to rely on protracted mild lockdowns or to opt for more stringent measures. To shed light on this issue, the analysis uses quadratic terms of the lockdown index in the regression framework.

Low and high stringency in panels 2 and 3 refer to the 25th and 75th percentile of lockdown stringency. The shaded areas in panels 2 and 3 correspond to 90 percent conﬁdence intervals computed with standard errors clustered at the country level. A lockdown tightening corresponds to an increase in the index by 100 units. Countries tend to introduce different lockdown measures following a similar sequence. More stringent lockdowns have a marginally weaker impact on mobility but stronger effects on infections. Figure 2.8.

This suggests that lockdowns have marginally weaker negative economic effects as they become more and more stringent. For example, stay-at-home orders may have only a modest negative impact on economic activity if governments have already mandated workplace closures. Conversely, panel 3 shows that lockdowns become progressively more effective in reducing COVID-19 cases when they become sufficiently stringent. Mild lockdowns appear instead ineffective in curbing infections. A possible interpretation is that preventing only a few instances of personal contacts, such as by closing schools alone, is not enough to reduce commu- nity spread significantly. Additional measures, such as workplace closures or stay-at-home orders, are needed to effectively bring the virus under control. These results suggest that to achieve a given reduc- tion in infections, policymakers may want to opt for stringent lockdowns over a shorter period rather than prolonged mild lockdowns. Based on past experi- ence, tighter lockdowns appear indeed to entail only modest additional economic costs while leading to a considerably stronger decline in infections. It will be important to reexamine these results as the pandemic progresses because the relative benefits between mild and tight lockdowns may change. For example, if an expansion of contact tracing and broader use of face masks succeed in limiting infections, mild lockdowns could be sufficient to contain new localized flare-ups of the virus. Conclusions This chapter has documented the crucial role that both lockdowns and voluntary social distancing in response to rising infections have played in reducing economic activity during the pandemic. Consistent evidence on the impact of lockdowns is provided by examining cross-country economic indicators and high-frequency proxies for economic activity, such as mobility and job posting data from Google and Indeed. Furthermore, the negative impact of lock- downs on mobility is robust to using subnational data to strengthen identification. Despite lockdowns having negative short-term eco- nomic effects, letting infections grow uncontrolled can also have dire economic consequences. This is because voluntary social distancing in response to rising COVID-19 infections has severe detrimental effects on the economy. The contribution of voluntary social distancing in reducing mobility is particularly high in advanced economies, where people can more easily stay at home thanks to teleworking arrangements, higher personal savings, and more generous social security benefits. The important contribution of voluntary social distancing to the recession should caution against expecting a quick economic rebound once lockdowns are lifted. This is especially relevant for countries that lift lockdowns prematurely, when infections are still relatively high. In this case, lockdowns tend to have a weaker impact on mobility, likely because peo- ple’s decisions are driven by fear of contracting the virus. Further tempering the expectations of a sharp economic rebound, the analysis shows that lifting lockdowns tends to have a more modest impact on mobility compared with the impact of a lockdown tightening. These findings suggest that, as long as significant health risks persist, economic activity is likely to remain subdued. Therefore, policymakers should refrain from withdrawing policy support too quickly and preserve spending on social safety nets. Further- more, it is important to support economic activity consistent with persistent social distancing, for example by encouraging work from home, facilitating a reallo- cation of resources toward less-contact-intensive sec- tors, and promoting the adoption of new technologies to limit the contact intensity within given sectors. The chapter also provides novel evidence about the unequal effects of lockdowns that severely affect economically vulnerable segments of the popula- tion. Mobility data provided by Vodafone for some European countries show that lockdown measures— especially school closures—tend to generate a larger drop in women’s mobility. This likely reflects wom- en’s disproportionate role in childcare, which could jeopardize their employment opportunities during the crisis. Lockdowns tend to also generate a sharper reduction in the mobility of younger cohorts, a worri- some outcome because younger workers rely on labor income and often have temporary job contracts that are at greater risk of being terminated. Targeted policy intervention, such as strengthening unemployment benefits for vulnerable categories and supporting paid leave for parents, is needed to ensure that the crisis ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-94-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 76 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 does not contribute to widening gender and intergen- erational inequality. The analysis also finds that lockdowns are powerful instruments to reduce infections, especially when they are introduced early in a country’s epidemic and when they are sufficiently stringent. Considering also that lockdowns appear to impose decreasing marginal costs on economic activity as they become more stringent, policymakers may want to lean toward rapidly adopt- ing tight lockdowns when infections increase rather than rely on delayed mild measures. Nonetheless, these recommendations will need to be reassessed as the understanding of the virus and means to counteract it improve. A crucial area of research is to examine the effectiveness of more-targeted instruments compared with blunt lockdowns, for example restrictions on dense indoor gatherings or measures to isolate people who are more vulnerable to the virus. The effectiveness of lockdowns in reducing infec- tions, coupled with the finding that infections can con- siderably harm economic activity because of voluntary social distancing, provides an important new perspec- tive on the costs of lockdowns. The prevailing narra- tive often portrays lockdowns as involving a trade-off between saving lives and supporting the economy. This characterization neglects the point that, despite imposing short-term economic costs, lockdowns may lead to a faster economic recovery by containing the virus and reducing voluntary social distancing. These medium-term gains may offset the short-term costs of lockdowns, possibly even leading to posi- tive overall effects on the economy. More research is warranted on this important aspect as the crisis evolves and more data become available. Meanwhile, policy- makers should also look for alternative ways to contain infections that may have even lower economic costs. In line with the advice of public health experts, these may include expanding testing and contact tracing, promoting the use of face masks, and encouraging working from home. The analytical results and policy implications presented in this chapter are subject to several caveats. First, the analysis tries to alleviate concerns about the endogeneity of lockdowns by showing that the results hold using cross-sectional and time-series identification and by relying on national and subnational data when available. However, identification concerns cannot be fully dismissed, including regarding the measurement of voluntary social distancing. Second, the analysis relies on short-term indicators, such as mobility and job postings, which provide an imperfect measure of economic activity. The chapter’s findings will need to be reexamined as more conventional economic indi- cators become available. Third, the analysis focuses on the economic consequences of lockdowns, neglecting important side effects, for example, on educational attainment and mental health issues. These are crucial areas for future research. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-95-2048.jpg) ![CHAPTER 2 THE GREAT LOCKDOWN: DISSECTING THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS 77International Monetary Fund | October 2020 The literature on the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic has been expanding at a very rapid pace. This box offers an inexhaustive overview of some of this literature that focuses on the impact of lockdown measures.1 Economic Impact of Lockdowns and Inequality Aspects Several authors point to a substantial role of lock- downs in the United States leading to employment losses, substantial decline in spending, and deterioration in local economic conditions (Baek and others 2020; Baker and others 2020; Béland, Brodeur, and Wright 2020; Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf 2020; Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber 2020; Gupta and others 2020). Similar effects have been documented across different countries (Carvalho and others 2020; Chronopoulos, Lukas, and Wilson 2020; Deb and others 2020a; Demirgüç-Kunt, Lokshin, and Torre 2020). Other papers argue that voluntary social distanc- ing has had a more important role than lockdowns (Allcott and others 2020; Bartik and others 2020; Kahn, Lange, and Wiczer 2020; Maloney and Taskin 2020). This literature notes that people’s mobility and economic activity in the United States contracted before lockdowns (Chetty and others 2020), and that lifting lockdowns led to a limited rebound in mobility (Dave and others 2020b) and economic activity (how- ever, Cajner and others 2020 and Glaeser and others 2020 are exceptions). Goolsbee and Syverson (2020) finds small differences in people’s visits to nearby retail establishments that faced different regulatory restric- tions because they were located in different jurisdic- tions. Chen and others (2020b) documents similar results; it expands the analysis to Europe and finds no robust evidence of the impact of lockdowns. Sweden’s case also highlights the importance of voluntary social distancing—despite avoiding strict lockdown mea- sures, the country has experienced similar declines in mobility and economic activities compared with comparable countries (Andersen and others 2020a; Born, Dietrich, and Müller 2020; Bricco and others 2020; Chen and others 2020b). Aum, Lee, and Shin (2020) draws relatively similar conclusions analyzing the South Korean experience. The author of this box is Nicola Pierri. 1At the time of writing, most of the cited papers had not yet undergone a peer-review process; thus, their conclusions must be interpreted with caution. The literature also documents that the early phases of the pandemic have had a harsher effect on more economically vulnerable individuals, both in the United States and other countries (Alstadsæter and others 2020; Béland, Brodeur, and Wright 2020). These individuals include those with lower income and educational attainment (Cajner and others 2020; Chetty and others 2020; Shibata 2020), minorities (Fairlie, Couch, and Xu 2020), immigrants (Borjas and Cassidy 2020), and women (Alon and others 2020a; Del Boca and others 2020; Papanikolaou and Schmidt 2020). One reason is that lower-paid workers are often unable to perform their jobs from home (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2020; Dingel and Neiman 2020; Gottlieb and others 2020). This warns of a potential widening of inequality (Mongey, Pilossoph, and Weinberg 2020; Palomino, Rodríguez, and Sebastian 2020). Some papers use rich structural models of production to predict the damage of lockdowns, mostly finding very large effects on economic activities (Barrot, Grassi, and Sauvagnat 2020; Baqaee and Farhi 2020a; Bonadio and others 2020; Cakmaklı and others 2020; Fadinger and Schymik 2020; Inoue and Todo 2020) and on firms’ liquidity and solvency (Carletti and others 2020; Gourinchas and others 2020; Schivardi and Romano 2020). Chen and others (2020a) looks at stock market reactions instead and presents evidence consistent with market beliefs that mitigation policies are good for businesses in the long term. Furthermore, some papers study how supply shocks may cause demand shortage (Guerrieri and others 2020) and interact with nominal rigidities (Baqaee and Farhi 2020b). Impact of Lockdowns and Social Distancing on Infections Some empirical analyses also document a significant role of social distancing and lockdowns in slowing the spread of the coronavirus (Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf 2020; Ciminelli and Garcia-Mandico 2020; Dave and others 2020a; Deb and others 2020b; Demirgüç-Kunt, Lokshin, and Torre 2020; di Porto, Naticchioni, and Scrutinio 2020; Fang, Wang, and Yang 2020; Friedson and others 2020; Glaeser, Gor- back, and Redding 2020; Imai and others 2020; Jin- jarak and others 2020; Yilmazkuday 2020).

Some of these papers also argue that less restrictive mitigation policies, such as wearing face masks and mass testing, can play an important role in slowing the spread of infection (Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf 2020; Gapen and others 2020). Optimal Mitigation Policy and Historical Perspectives Some studies use theoretical (mostly quantitative) models to characterize optimal mitigation policies while considering the detrimental impact on the econ- omy. For instance, see Acemoglu and others (2020); Akbarpour and others (2020); Alvarez, Argente, and Lippi (2020); Bodenstein, Corsetti, and Guerrieri (2020); Cakmaklı and others (2020); Checo, Grigoli, and Mota (2020); Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020); Farboodi, Jarosch, and Shimer (2020); Favero, Ichino, and Rustichini (2020); and Jones, Philippon, and Venkateswaran (2020). The higher risk faced by the elderly, the role of voluntary social distancing, and hospital capacity constraints are among several issues these models study. Many of these papers document an important role for targeted lockdown policies and early interventions. Others focus on how optimal policies may differ in developing economies (Alon and others 2020b; von Carnap and others 2020). A few papers offer a historical perspective on the economic impact of lockdowns. Correia, Luck, and Verner (2020) finds that lockdowns imposed in US cities to contain the Spanish flu had a positive impact on their subsequent growth, although Lilley, Lilley, and Rinaldi (2020) revisits this evidence and argues that it is inconclusive. Bodenhorn (2020) studies the Spanish flu’s impact in the US South and finds no evidence that mandated business closures led to more business failures.

Information technology can dampen the economic effect of the pandemic in several ways: by facilitating teleworking, promoting online sales, or organizing contactless delivery. The analysis finds that employment has been more resilient in US states where firms use information technology more inten- sively. Panel 1 of Figure 2.2.1 shows the increase in the unemployment rate between February and April for each US state over the stringency of lockdowns during the same period. Similarly, panel 2 illustrates the association between the increase in unemployment and the drop in mobility. In states with low levels of information technology adoption, there is a strong correlation between the intensity of the lockdown, the drop in mobility, and the rise in the unemployment rate. Conversely, lockdowns and mobility are not asso- ciated with rising unemployment rates in states with higher levels of information technology adoption. This suggests that information technology may significantly shield local economies during the pandemic. This pattern is confirmed using individual-level data from the Current Population Survey, a joint survey by the US Census Bureau and US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The probability of being unem- ployed in April is higher for respondents living in metropolitan statistical areas that experienced larger mobility declines, but companies’ information technology adoption mitigates this impact.1 The increase in the probability of being unemployed associated with a large drop in mobility (one standard deviation, equal to 10 percentage points) is 25 percent larger in metropolitan statistical areas with low levels of information technology adoption than in those with high levels (5 percentage points versus 4 percentage points). The analysis also explores the impact of informa- tion technology adoption across different categories of workers (panel 3 of Figure 2.2.1). Information technology cushions the unemployment impact of mobility for both male and female and for both white and nonwhite workers. However, it does not The authors of this box are Nicola Pierri and Yannick Timmer.

Panel 3 illustrates the results of a regression using data from the Current Population Survey in which the dependent variable is a dummy indicating if the respondent is unemployed in April 2020, and the independent variables are the IT adoption and the drop in mobility in the metropolitan statistical area where the respondent lives, together with their interaction. The y-axis of panel 3 reports the magnitude of the coefﬁcient of the interaction term for each subsample. Low education refers to respondents who did not graduate from high school. See Pierri and Timmer (2020) for more details. IT = information technology. Figure 2.2.1.

The analysis in this chapter suggests that an initial green investment push combined with steadily rising carbon prices would deliver the needed emission reductions at reasonable transitional global output effects, putting the global economy on a stronger and more sustainable footing over the medium term. Carbon pricing is critical to mitigation because higher carbon prices incentivize energy efficiency besides reallocat- ing resources from high- to low-carbon activities. A green investment push up front would strengthen the macroeconomy in the short term and help lower the costs of adjusting to higher carbon prices. The transi- tional costs of carbon pricing consistent with net zero emissions by mid-century appear manageable and could be reduced further as new technological innova- tions develop in response to carbon pricing and green research and development subsidies. Governments can protect those most affected by mitigation by providing targeted cash transfers financed by carbon revenues. Introduction Global warming continues apace. The increase in the average temperature over the surface of the planet since the industrial revolution is estimated at about 1°C and is believed to be accelerating. Each successive decade since the 1980s has been warmer than the previous one, the past five years (2015–19) were the warmest ever reported, and 2019 was likely the second-warmest year on record. Rising pressure on Earth systems is already evident from more frequent weather-related The authors of this chapter are Philip Barrett, Christian Bogmans, Benjamin Carton, Johannes Eugster, Florence Jaumotte (lead), Adil Mohommad, Evgenia Pugacheva, Marina M.

Scientific studies attribute most of global warm- ing to emissions of greenhouse gases associated with human activity, especially from the carbon released by burning fossil fuels (IPCC 2014, 2018a) (see Box 3.1 for a glossary).2 Scientists have warned that tempera- ture increases relative to preindustrial levels need to be kept well below 2°C—and ideally 1.5°C—to avoid reaching climate tipping points and imposing severe stress on natural and socioeconomic systems (IPCC 2014, 2018a). The objective of limiting temperature increases by 2100 to 1.5°C–2°C was endorsed world- wide by policymakers in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Sizable and rapid reductions in carbon emissions are needed for this goal to be met; specifically, net carbon emissions need to decline to zero by mid-century (IPCC 2014, 2018a). This means that carbon emis- sions must be eliminated or that any remaining carbon emissions must be removed from the atmosphere by natural (for example, forests and oceans) or artificial (for example, carbon capture and storage) sinks. Even with such drastic reductions, temperatures may tempo- rarily overshoot the target until the stock of accumu- lated carbon in the atmosphere is sufficiently reduced by absorption by carbon sinks. 1See also Chapter 2 of the April 2020 Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Economic Outlook, Chapter 3 of the October 2017 World Economic Outlook, and Kahn and others (2019). Adaptation policies are another critical element of the strategy to reduce losses from climate change and, in some cases, can overlap with mitigation policies (such as for the preservation of rain forests). However, these are beyond the scope of this chapter. 2Greenhouse gas is any gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth’s surface and radiating it back to Earth’s surface. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. The chapter focuses on carbon emissions from the con- sumption of fossil fuels, which is a main driver of human-made greenhouse gas emissions. IMF (2019) discusses policies to reduce other important sources of greenhouse gas emissions beyond domes- tic fossil fuel CO2 emissions (forestry, agriculture, methane leaks, industrial process emissions, F-gases, international aviation/maritime emissions). MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE—GROWTH- AND DISTRIBUTION-FRIENDLY STRATEGIES3 CHAPTER ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-104-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 86 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 Tangible policy responses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have been grossly insufficient to date.3 While the COVID-19 crisis has reduced emissions, it is already evident that this decline will be only temporary. Under unchanged policies, emissions will continue to rise relentlessly, and global temperatures could increase by an additional 2–5°C by the end of this century, reaching levels not seen in millions of years, imposing growing physical and economic damage, and increasing the risk of catastrophic outcomes across the planet (Figure 3.1).4 Damages from climate change include (but are not limited to) lower productivity due to changes in the yield of agricultural crops and fish farming and hotter temperatures for people working outside; more frequent disruption of economic activity and greater physical destruction of productive capital, infrastructure, and buildings as a result of more frequent and severe natural disasters and (for coastal areas) the rise in sea levels; deterioration of health and possible loss of life due to natural disasters and increased prevalence of infectious diseases; and diversion of resources toward adaptation and reconstruction (see, for example, Batten 2018).5 The response of temperatures to the accumulated stock of carbon emissions in the atmosphere (“climate sensitivity”) and the damages that can be expected for given temperature increases are subject to uncertainty; many of the damages—including damages to the natural world and catastrophic risk—are also insufficiently captured by existing estimates, which are based on small historical variations in temperatures. Nevertheless, by all estimates, damages are expected to be substantial, and more recent studies that take account of the possibility 3For most countries, the Nationally Determined Contributions pledged under the Paris Agreement are deemed insufficient to meet either the 1.5°C or the 2°C target, and, judging by current policies, unlikely to be met in the first place (see Climate Action Tracker Warming Projections Global Update—December 2019). Views about the shortfalls of stated policies have been echoed by others, such as the International Energy Agency, which points out that significantly more ambitious policies are needed to reach the targets (IEA 2019). 4Absent climate change mitigation policies or massive migration, one-third of the global population could experience mean annual temperatures above 29°C by 2070. Such temperatures are currently found in only 0.8 percent of Earth’s land surface, mostly in Africa, and are projected to cover 19 percent of land by 2070 (Xu and others 2020). 5Climate change will also complicate the management of macro- economic stability, as climatic changes and natural disasters increase output and price volatility and, with the costs of natural disasters— from reconstruction to investment in adaptation—put pressure on fiscal sustainability. Last but not least, it will increase poverty and inequality because lower-income countries and lower-income people in any given country tend to be not only more exposed to but also less able to handle shocks or adapt to climate change.

Various changes that global warming is setting in motion, such as the melting of the ice caps and rise in sea levels, and the acidification of oceans could them- selves reinforce global warming and would be very hard to reverse over human timescales (IPCC 2014, 2018a). The COVID-19 crisis creates both challenges and opportunities for the climate change mitigation agenda. Though mitigation is likely to boost incomes in the long term by limiting damages and severe physical risks, the economic transformation it requires may lower growth during the transition, especially in countries heavily reliant on fossil fuel exports and in those with rapid economic and population growth. The current global recession makes it more challenging to enact the policies needed for mitigation and raises the urgency of understanding how mitigation can be achieved in an employment- and growth-friendly way and with protection for the poor. However, there are also opportunities in the current context to put the economy on a greener path (see also the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor).6 The crisis has led to a major retrench- ment in investment and policies can seek to ensure that the composition of the recovery in capital spend- ing is consistent with decarbonization by providing correct price signals and other financial incentives. In addition, fiscal stimulus—which will likely be needed in the aftermath of the pandemic—can be an opportu- nity to boost green and resilient public infrastructure. This chapter takes the goal of reducing net car- bon emissions to zero by 2050 as given and looks at possible ways of designing mitigation policies, being mindful of constraints related to political feasibility.7 Specifically, the chapter asks the following two questions: •• Which combination of policy tools—carbon pricing, a public and private investment push, research and development subsidies—would allow the world 6For discussions on this, see Batini and others (2020), Bhattacharya and Rydge (2020), Black and Parry (2020), and Hepburn and others (2020). 7Almost all countries are revising their climate strategies under the Paris Agreement (Nationally Determined Contributions) ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) meeting. About 70 countries have committed to net zero emissions by 2050. Under net zero emissions, positive emissions would need to be offset by negative emissions (such as co-firing biofuels in power generation with carbon capture and storage, expanding forest carbon storage, and direct air capture technologies). to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in a growth-, employment-, and distribution-friendly way? •• Can well-designed and sequenced mitigation policies help with the economic repair from the COVID-19 crisis? While issues of international coordination are important, the depth of emission reductions tar- geted in this chapter (reaching net zero emissions) limits the room for differentiation of mitigation efforts across countries, especially across the large ones. Each country/region is thus assumed to reduce emissions to the same extent (with the exception of a group of selected oil-exporting and other economies where emissions are assumed to remain at current levels). A deep decarbonization of human activity will require both energy efficiency and the share of low-carbon sources in energy supply to increase radi- cally more than in recent decades. Incentivizing these changes will require carbon-intensive energy to become much more expensive relative to both low-carbon energy and other goods and services than it is today. Fossil fuels are now massively underpriced, reflecting undercharging for production and environmental costs—including for air pollution and global warm- ing. Coady and others (2019) estimate global energy subsidies—the gap between existing and efficient prices (that is, prices warranted by supply costs, environmen- tal costs, and revenue considerations)—at a striking $4.7 trillion in 2015, or about 6.3 percent of global GDP. A narrower subsidy measure, reflecting only differences between the amount consumers actually pay for fuel use and the corresponding opportunity cost of supplying the fuel, was estimated by Coady and others (2019) at $305 billion globally in 2015. Governments can use various measures to raise the relative price of carbon-intensive activities. The first set of policies consists of raising the price of carbon through either carbon taxes or carbon emission trading programs to price the emission externality. Correctly pricing carbon would reduce its use while boosting the supply of low-carbon alternatives. While the chapter focuses on a carbon tax as a way to raise carbon prices, introducing feebates or imposing direct mandates and regulations on emissions are alternative or complemen- tary tools that are less efficient but raise the implicit price of carbon and may face less political resistance (see the October 2019 Fiscal Monitor for a discussion ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-106-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 88 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 of efficiency/feasibility trade-offs).8 The second set of policies directly aims at making low-carbon energy sources more abundant and cheaper and tackles broader market failures (such as knowledge spillovers, network externalities, and scale economies) in their provision. The toolkit for this approach includes subsidies and price guarantees to increase demand, investment, and supply in the low-carbon energy sector; direct public investment in low-carbon technol- ogies and infrastructure; and research and development subsidies to spur innovation.9 Other policy options include the further develop- ment and adoption of negative emission technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, which are assumed to play a role in the modeling of emission reduction strategies in the chapter, and solar radiation modifica- tion measures, which can be effective in theory but in practice involve large uncertainties, risks, and knowl- edge gaps.10 The optimal mix and sequencing of mitigation policy tools, along with their macroeconomic implications, are still matters of much debate. Some commentators argue that reining in climate change through carbon pricing, while boosting output and welfare in the long term, could weaken growth in the short to medium term, as higher energy prices raise living costs (especially for the poor), displace workers, and reduce profits in carbon-intensive activities. However, some of these effects can be reduced if carbon pricing revenues are used to boost growth (for example, through funding pro- ductive investment or reducing distortionary taxes). Others stress the possibility of “green growth,” 8Feebates are sectoral measures (for example, on transport, indus- try, or power) that impose a sliding scale of fees on firms/goods with emission rates (for example, CO2 per kilowatt-hour) above a “pivot point” level and corresponding subsidies for firms/goods with emis- sion rates below the pivot point. They are a hybrid between carbon pricing and green supply policies and may be more politically accept- able as they avoid an increase in the price of energy. Feebates can be used on their own or play a reinforcing role by complementing other instruments (see the October 2019 Fiscal Monitor). 9A broad package of measures is likely ideal, as the two types of policies can be expected to work in synergy. For instance, higher carbon prices would be more acceptable to the public—and so more sustainable—if low-carbon energy sources were available at a reason- able cost. Conversely, subsidies may not encourage strong private investment in low-carbon technologies if they are not coupled with expectations of a sufficiently high carbon price in the future. 10Solar radiation modification attempts to offset the warming from emissions accumulated in the atmosphere, while carbon capture and storage directly limits atmospheric greenhouse gas accumulation. arguing that government support for sustainable investment and technologies—together with higher expected carbon prices—can stimulate activity in the short to medium term through higher net invest- ment, especially when the economy is operating below potential.11 Another argument is that decar- bonization policies focused on innovation policy (such as research subsidies) could trigger waves of technological change that would boost productivity and growth in the medium to long term. This chapter approaches these questions in three ways. The first takes stock of the mitigation policies implemented in a large sample of countries over the past 25 years or so, and examines their roles in the shift from high- to low-carbon activities and what impact that had on overall activity. The analysis focuses on the power sector, which was the target of many of these policies. The second uses three macroeconomic models to examine mitigation policies needed to get to net zero emissions by 2050 and how to design them to be as growth friendly as possible. The third part of the approach examines the distributional effects of mitigation policies by modeling their impact on both consumption and labor income of households. It also looks at different ways of using carbon revenues to mitigate the adverse effects on those whose livelihoods would be the most affected. The chapter finds that climate change mitiga- tion policies have made important contributions to reallocating innovation, electricity generation, and employment toward low-carbon activities, broadly without harming overall activity. Supported by these empirical results, the chapter’s model simulations suggest that getting to net zero emissions by 2050 is still within reach, though the window to keep temperature increases to safe levels is closing rapidly. This would put the global economy on a sustainable growth path in the second half of the century and 11While the terms “low” and “high” carbon refer to a specific metric (CO2), the term “green” originates in the environment literature and generally refers to activities that have a (very) small impact on the environment. While “green” is commonly used to refer to low-carbon activities, these may not be strictly green, but just greener. For instance, wind and solar are low-carbon energy sources, but they are land and resource/material intensive. The same holds for other low-carbon sources of energy, such as hydro or nuclear power, which points to the issue of problem-shifting in a world characterized by multiple environmental problems. “Renewable energy” refers to wind and solar energy and to the fact that these technologies do not require fossil fuels, which are nonrenewable on human timescales. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-107-2048.jpg) ![CHAPTER 3 MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE—GROWTH- AND DISTRIBUTION-FRIENDLY STRATEGIES 89International Monetary Fund | October 2020 beyond and immediately yield substantial domestic co-benefits from mitigation policies—mainly thanks to reduced mortality and morbidity from less environmental pollution.12 An initial green investment push combined with initially moderate and gradually rising carbon prices would deliver the needed emission reductions at reasonable output effects. A green fiscal stimulus would support global GDP and employment during the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and lay the ground for higher carbon prices by boosting productivity in low-carbon sectors. As the recovery takes hold, preannounced and gradually rising carbon prices become a powerful tool to deliver the quick and substantial reductions in carbon emissions required to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Along the transition, higher carbon prices would entail global output losses, but these losses would be moderate relative to the expected income gains from avoided climate damage in the second half of the century and beyond. Growth in the medium and long term will be harmed considerably unless climate change is addressed, making the benefits from miti- gation much higher than the temporary benefits from inaction.13 The transitional economic costs would be reduced further if new low-carbon technologies were developed, and a strong case can be made to comple- ment early on the innovation incentives sparked by carbon pricing with green research and development subsidies that help remove obstacles to developing new technologies. The economic costs of the low-carbon transition dif- fer across the world. Countries with fast economic and population growth (such as India and, to a lesser extent, China), those with heavy reliance on high-carbon energy (such as China), and most oil producers are likely to bear larger transition costs. However, for fast-growing countries, these costs remain small given their projected growth over the next 30 years (even under mitigation) and need to be weighed against substantial avoided damage from climate change and co-benefits from climate change mitigation, such as reduced local pollution and mortality rates. If advanced economies were to enact mitigation policies on their own, they would not be able to keep global emissions and temperature increases to safe levels; joint action 12See Parry, Veung, and Heine (2015) and the October 2019 Fiscal Monitor for details on the unilateral costs and domestic net benefits of a $50/ton carbon tax in the Group of Twenty countries. 13See also Stern (2007) and Hassler, Krusell, and Olovsson (2018). by the largest economies is critical to avoid the worst outcomes of climate change. For fossil fuel producers, the required diversification of their economies will be difficult, but many of them also stand to benefit from global climate change mitigation. Finally, whereas carbon pricing would dispropor- tionately affect poorer households, recycling one-sixth to one-quarter of carbon revenues as targeted transfers could fully compensate the poorest 20 percent of households. Fully compensating the poorest 40 percent of households would require recycling between 40 and 55 percent of the carbon revenues. In addition, some limited government spending on low-carbon sectors would support job transitions from high-carbon to low-carbon sectors. Conscious and determined action by governments to build inclusion will be key to enhance the social and political acceptability of the transition. The Mitigation Toolkit: How Have Policies Worked So Far? Global innovation and investment in clean energy technologies have increased dramatically over the past two decades or so amid tightening environmental policies (Figure 3.2, panel 1).14 Environmental policies cover a range of instruments used to varying degrees. Emission limits, notably for power (electricity) plants, and research and development subsidies (“nonmarket instruments”) have been widely used since the 1990s and have become more stringent over time. The use of “market instruments,” such as trading programs and feed-in tariffs, has picked up since the early 2000s, whereas carbon taxes have yet to become binding con- straints in most countries (Figure 3.2, panel 2).15 14This chapter uses the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Environmental Policy Stringency Index, as published in OECD (2018). For more details, see Botta and Koźluk (2014). 15Under feed-in tariffs, producers of renewable electricity are offered long-term contracts that guarantee a fixed price for every unit of electricity delivered to the grid. Trading programs include green and white certificates and those covering emissions of various pollut- ants. Green and white certificates are titles, respectively, for reaching renewable energy targets (portfolio standards) or energy-saving targets. In an emission trading program, a fixed number of emission permits is allocated or sold by a central institution, and the price adjusts to supply and demand. In contrast, a tax on carbon (or other pollutants) defines a price, or more precisely a markup, and lets the quantity of emissions adjust. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-108-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 90 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 Over the same period, clean energy innovation (measured by patent applications)16 doubled in share of total energy innovation; and clean electricity innovation now accounts for half of total electricity innovation in the top five innovating countries (up from 15 percent in 1990). The global share of solar and wind power in electricity generation has also increased substantially, from virtually zero in 2000 to 6 ½ percent in 2020, with much higher shares in some European Union countries. Furthermore, the transition in electricity generation 16The analysis focuses on clean innovation in the energy sector, given the sector’s important contribution to total emissions and innovation in clean technologies and its direct exposure to most of the environmental policies analyzed. Clean energy innovation is defined here as the number of patent applications in climate change mitigation technologies related to energy generation, transmission, or distribution, as classified by Haščič and Migotto (2015). is accelerating: whereas the global renewable share was increasing at a pace of ½ percentage point a year by 2010, that number reached 1 percentage point by 2016. Econometric analysis suggests that the tightening of environmental policies in many countries has played an important role in the changing composition of energy sector innovation and investment toward low-carbon activities (Figure 3.3; Online Annexes 3.1 and 3.2).17 Specifically, more stringent environmental policies are estimated to have contributed to the following: •• Thirty percent of the increase in global clean energy innovation, equivalent to the effect of a perma- nent rise in oil prices of $66 a barrel. Higher oil prices explain the rest of the increase up to 2010, though this reversed after 2010. In the electricity sector, environmental policies increased the share of innovation in clean and “gray” electricity technolo- gies (gray innovations reduce the pollution of dirty technologies) at the expense of dirty technologies.18 Environmental policies contributed to more electric- ity innovation overall (Figure 3.3, panel 1). •• Fifty-five percent of the increase in the share of renewables in electricity generation. Tighter environ- mental policies were associated with declines in the share of coal and an ambiguous effect on the share of natural gas—often a complement to renewable energy (Figure 3.3, panel 2). The intermittent nature of renewables requires backup power in the form of batteries or generators that can dispatch electricity to the grid quickly, such as from hydroelectric or natural gas power plants. By and large, environmental poli- cies do not appear to be associated with a discernible negative impact on total electricity generation. Various policy instruments are found to be effec- tive in spurring both innovation and investment in renewables. •• Both market and nonmarket policies—in particular research and development subsidies, trading pro- grams, emission limits, and feed-in tariffs—were effective in spurring clean innovation. Oil prices 17The analyses cover about 30 advanced economies and emerging market economies during 1990–2015.

This has coincided with the partial reversal of regulatory tightening and the shale oil and gas boom in the United States, which capped oil price increases.20 Popp and others (2020) also point to the possible role of an earlier clean-tech bubble and falling returns on clean innovation. Though the estimated effect of higher carbon prices was far from statistically significant—likely reflecting limited take-up of this instrument and limited statistical power—the significant impact of oil prices on clean innova- tion suggests that policies that increase the cost of dirty energy may be a strong incentive for clean innovation. •• Instruments that seem to have a clear positive impact on investment in renewable electricity generation are feed-in tariffs and trading pro- grams (which include green certificates to achieve renewable portfolio standards and carbon emis- sion trading programs).21 Green certificate pro- grams are being phased out in several countries, and carbon tax and carbon trading programs are expected to become more important. As the share of renewables in electricity generation increases, addressing their intermittency will become increas- ingly relevant, likely requiring significant public investment in grids and innovation (such as storage technologies). Finally, the analysis examined the impact of tighter environmental policies on employment in high- and low-carbon sectors (see Online Annex 3.3). A concern with decarbonization policies is that they will lead to job losses in carbon-intensive activities, such as coal mining, shale oil and gas production, carbon-intensive 19The estimation of the effect of oil prices relies on a separate regression, with identical controls but without year fixed effects. 20Acemoglu and others (2019) discusses how the shale gas revolu- tion has set back clean innovation. 21Under feed-in tariffs, producers of renewable electricity are offered long-term contracts that guarantee a fixed price for every unit of electricity delivered to the grid. Green certificates are a means to implement government-mandated renewable portfolio standards, measured as the percentage of electricity that utilities need to source from renewables. Figure 3.3. Effect of Policy Tightening on Electricity Innovation, Electricity Generation, and Employment, by Type of Technology More stringent environmental policies stimulated innovation in climate- change-mitigating energy technologies and raised the share of renewable electricity generation. They also raised employment in the “green” sectors and lowered it in the “brown” sectors. 3. Effect on Employment, by Sector and Emission Intensity (Percent change) 2.

Production in renewable energy is more job intensive than electricity generation based on fossil fuels (see below).23 But the substitution may not be full (given that mitigation policies curb emissions in part through reduced energy demand and intensity), and the net effect can be insignificant or negative. Evidence from firms sug- gests that job losses in some high-emission sectors (for example, high-emission manufacturing, transportation) in response to tighter environmental policies can be offset by job creation in some low-emission sectors (for example, low-emission manufacturing and services).24 The net effect on aggregate jobs is typically small and indeterminate, depending on the extent of substitution between high- and low-emission activities (Figure 3.3, panel 3).25 In general, the job effects seem larger and net negative in response to changes in nonmarket poli- cies, whereas market policies, such as feed-in tariffs and trading programs, have a more muted and net positive effect. The impact on fossil fuel industry employment is not significant and reflects the opposing effects of tax-based policies (negative) and trading-based policies (positive). All in all, the evidence indicates that environ- mental policies have succeeded in reallocating jobs from high- to low-carbon sectors. However, job transitions can involve costs for the workers affected, and it will be important to examine distributional consequences arising from the labor market effects of climate policies (see the “How to Build Inclusion” section). 22The literature suggests that tighter climate change mitigation policies, such as carbon taxation, have led to job losses among the low-skilled and workers in high-emission industries, though effects on overall employment are less clear. See Kahn (1997) and Yamazaki (2017) for employment effects across different sectors, Yip (2018) and Marin and Vona (2019) for effects across skill types, and Metcalf and Stock (2020) for aggregate employment effects. Notably, Yamazaki (2017) shows that a revenue-neutral carbon tax can have a small positive and significant employment effect. 23Renewables production and installation tends to be more labor intensive than fossil fuel technologies, as capacity investments in renewable electricity generation tend to be more modular and come in relatively small increments. 24High-emission manufacturing sectors include chemicals, metals and minerals, paper and packaging, and food. 25Policy tightening would increase costs for high-emission firms and, depending on elasticity of demand, reduce output (and employ- ment). Conversely, labor demand could increase in sectors/firms where energy is substitutable with labor, for example among services (see Yamazaki 2017). How to Reach Net Zero Emissions by 2050 This part of the chapter examines the combinations of climate change mitigation policies needed to bring net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and how they may impact the macroeconomy. General equilibrium model analysis is required to simulate the effects of ambitious mitigation policies, given that these affect the economy through various channels and come with both negative and positive effects on output as some sectors contract and others expand. Their net effects cannot be predicted with certainty and depend on the relative strength of various channels. Mechanisms At a broad level, mitigation policies affect carbon emissions and the macroeconomy through the differ- ence between the prices of fossil fuel and clean energy and the overall energy price. Relative Price of Fossil Fuel and Low-Carbon Energy Both carbon pricing and green supply policies increase the price of fossil fuel energy relative to low-carbon energy by raising the price of carbon and/or lowering the price of renewables and other low-carbon energy. The increase in the price of fossil fuel energy rel- ative to clean energy raises demand for renewable energy and, more generally, activities with low carbon intensity and hence leads to a reallocation of investment, innova- tion, and employment in that direction. The net effect on economic activity will depend on the relative speed at which high-carbon sectors contract and low-carbon sectors can be scaled up (costs of adjusting capital can hinder a rapid scaling up). The net effect on investment and employment also depends on the relative capital- and labor intensity of the sectors. High-carbon sectors (such as fossil fuel energy and heavy manufacturing) are typically more capital intensive, whereas low-carbon sectors (such as renewable energy and many services) are more labor intensive. All else equal, the net effect of the reallocation of activity from high- to low-carbon sectors could therefore be more positive (less negative) for employment than investment. Finally, widening dif- ferences between the price of fossil fuel energy and clean energy can lead to wealth effects and stranded assets. Carbon-intensive activities have large footprints on financial portfolios in advanced economies and the net worth of fuel exporters. In an aggressive decarbonization scenario, early obsolescence of carbon-intensive capital would lead to wealth losses and drag down aggregate ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-111-2048.jpg) ![CHAPTER 3 MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE—GROWTH- AND DISTRIBUTION-FRIENDLY STRATEGIES 93International Monetary Fund | October 2020 demand in some economies. Chapter 5 of the October 2020 Global Financial Stability Report examines the potential financial stability implications of defaults of carbon-intensive businesses as a result of an increase in carbon prices. At the same time, countries with com- parative advantage in renewable energy and low-carbon technologies could experience positive wealth effects. Overall Energy Price Carbon pricing and green supply policies affect the overall energy price differently. While a carbon tax increases the overall energy price and can hurt eco- nomic activity, it also encourages energy efficiency and discourages energy usage. That said, revenues from carbon pricing could be used to offset these costs, for instance by directly incentivizing the supply of clean energy or financing green public infrastructure that helps reduce the energy intensity of economic activity or raises the efficiency of renewable power.26 Revenues can also be used to provide transfers to households to avoid hurting the poor and increase political accept- ability (October 2019 Fiscal Monitor). In contrast, green supply policies lower the overall price of energy and could potentially boost GDP, depending on how the policy support is financed (taxes versus borrowing). But green supply policies do not incentivize energy efficiency and can be accompanied by greater energy consumption, including of carbon-intensive sources (given the intermittency of renewable power). These differences explain both the greater efficacy of carbon taxes at reducing emissions and their greater output cost.27 When combined, green supply policies and carbon pricing can, in principle, prompt declines in emissions consistent with substantial climate change mitigation, without major shrinkage of output and consumption during the transition. In addition to providing price signals through carbon pricing and green supply policies, governments can directly stimulate green technologies by providing incentives for research. Innovation is driven by market size; as such, higher carbon prices (which expand markets for low-carbon activities and shrink those for carbon-intensive ones) would incentivize a shift toward greener research and development, lowering 26Another option for recycling revenue from carbon taxes is to cut distortionary taxes on labor and capital (for example, Goulder 1995 and Goulder and Parry 2008). 27Carbon taxes are a very effective way of reducing emissions also because they automatically impose the highest penalties on the most-polluting fuels. the prices of green technologies over time and ampli- fying decarbonization. Importantly, the presence of this amplifying mechanism would mean that a given decline in emissions could be delivered with lower carbon prices. The use of green research and develop- ment subsidies alongside carbon taxes is justified on economic grounds to resolve multiple market failures (for example, Acemoglu and others 2012, 2016; Stiglitz and others 2014). These may include knowl- edge spillovers from innovation that are not taken into account by private firms; path dependency of research, which gives the established technologies an advantage and creates entry barriers (through economies of scale, sunk costs, and network effects); and difficulty access- ing financing due to high uncertainty/risk, a long lag until innovation pays off, and lack of knowledge and information among investors. As with other green sup- ply policies, green research and development subsidies would lower the energy price overall, boosting output but also partly offsetting the reduction in emissions through higher energy consumption. Historically, gov- ernment research programs have had key roles in the development of large technological breakthroughs (for example, landing on the moon, or the prototype of the internet). More active government involvement— including through international cooperation—may be needed to assist in the development of technologies that can support the low-carbon transition. A Comprehensive Mitigation Package The goal of bringing net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 in each country can be achieved through a comprehensive policy package that is growth friendly (especially in the short term) and involves compensa- tory transfers to households to ensure inclusion. The 2050 objective is operationalized as a reduction in gross emissions by 80 percent, assuming that the expansion of natural emission sinks (such as forests) and some deployment of negative emission technologies (for example, carbon capture and storage technologies) will help absorb the remaining carbon emissions (IPCC 2018a, b). To implement such deep reductions in emis- sions at the global level, each country/region needs to reduce its own emissions by 80 percent, and there is lit- tle room for differentiation of mitigation efforts across countries. However, one exception is made for the group of selected oil-exporting and other economies, which are assumed to keep emissions at current levels because economic activity shrinks substantially due to ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-112-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 94 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 the fall in global oil demand. The policy package is designed with macroeconomic policy goals and political feasibility in mind and includes (1) a green fiscal stim- ulus that boosts demand and supply in the economy, supporting the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, and helps reduce the level of carbon prices required to reach the emission target; (2) gradually phased-in carbon price increases; and (3) compensatory transfers to households. Specifically, it includes the following: •• Green supply policies: These consist of an 80 percent subsidy rate on renewables production and a 10-year green public investment program (starting at 1 per- cent of GDP and linearly declining to zero over 10 years; after that, additional public investment maintains the green capital stock created). Public investment is assumed to take place in the renew- able and other low-carbon energy sectors, transport infrastructure, and services—the latter to capture the higher energy efficiency of buildings (see Online Annex 3.4 for more details).28 •• Carbon pricing: Carbon prices are calibrated to achieve the 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2050, after accounting for emission reductions from the green fiscal stimulus. A high annual growth rate of carbon prices (7 percent) is assumed to ensure low initial levels of the carbon price and a gradual phase-in of carbon prices.29 The needed carbon prices start at between $6 and $20 a ton of CO2 (depending on the country), reach between $10 and $40 a ton of CO2 in 2030, and are between $40 and $150 a ton of CO2 in 2050.30,31 •• Compensatory transfers: Households receive compen- sation equal to one-fourth of carbon tax revenues, which should protect the purchasing power of poor 28IEA (2020a) discusses green investment opportunities in the energy and transportation sectors and in energy efficiency (for example, retrofitting of buildings). See also McCollum and others (2018) for an estimate of energy investment needs for fulfilling the Paris Agreement and achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 29Gollier (2018a, b) finds that, contrary to the Hotelling rule (according to which greatest efficiency is achieved when the carbon tax grows at a rate equal to the interest rate), most scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change involve a rate of growth in the carbon tax higher than the interest rate, to reflect political constraints on the initial level of carbon taxes. 30The range of estimates of carbon prices needed to reach a certain level of emission reduction is large (see, for instance, IPCC 2014, Figure 6.21.a, or Stiglitz and others 2014). The relatively low levels of carbon prices in this chapter’s simulations reflect (1) the combi- nation of carbon prices with other instruments (green infrastructure investment and green subsidies), which achieve part of the emission reduction; (2) the high assumed growth rate of carbon prices, which back-loads their increases; and (3) the fact that the G-Cubed model embeds more substitutability between high- and low-carbon energy (based on econometric evidence) than engineering-based models. 31The real price of carbon continues to grow until 2080. households through targeted cash transfers (see the “How to Build Inclusion” section). •• Supportive macroeconomic policies: The policy package outlined above implies a fiscal easing that requires debt financing for the first decade and occurs amid low-for-long interest rates, given the current context of low inflation. Model Simulations Policy simulations are run using the G-Cubed global macroeconomic model (McKibbin and Wilcoxen 1999, 2013; Liu and others 2020; see Online Annex 3.4). The model features 10 countries/regions, detailed energy sec- tors, forward-looking agents, real and nominal rigidities, and fiscal and monetary policies. It is suited to examin- ing the effect of mitigation policies on carbon emis- sions related to the burning of fossil fuels and on the macroeconomic dynamics in the short, medium, and long term. The long-term dynamics of temperatures and estimates of the avoided damages from climate change are simulated using the integrated assessment model of Hassler and others (2020) and different climate change damage functions. The goal of the simulations presented in the chapter is to illustrate the main mechanisms at work and provide some order of quantification. The exact magnitudes in these long-term projections are unavoidably subject to substantial uncertainty. In the absence of new climate change mitigation pol- icies, global carbon emissions are projected to continue to rise at an average annual pace of 1.7 percent and reach 57.5 gigatons by 2050 (Figure 3.4).32 Improve- ments in energy efficiency and some penetration of renewables—reflecting a continuation of current policies and some autonomous increases (for example, reflecting consumer preferences)—cannot offset the forces of population and economic growth that are driving emissions. Whereas advanced economies have historically contributed the lion’s share of emissions, China and India, as large and fast-growing emerging market economies, are significant emitters and are expected to continue to account for growing shares of carbon emissions. Their per capita emissions, however, 32Black and Parry (2020) finds that the required emission reductions for meeting temperature stabilization goals are essentially unchanged by the current economic crisis. But the COVID-19 crisis could lead to long-term behavioral changes that would raise or lower emissions—such as reduced use of public transportation and greater reliance on individual vehicles or greater use of digital communi- cation, leading to reduced commuting and less travel. The baseline assumes (somewhat above) trend increases in energy efficiency. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-113-2048.jpg) ![CHAPTER 3 MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE—GROWTH- AND DISTRIBUTION-FRIENDLY STRATEGIES 95International Monetary Fund | October 2020 still remain relatively small when compared with those of advanced economies. Global growth is assumed to progressively decline from 3.7 percent in 2021 to 2.1 percent in 2050, reflecting a tapering off of growth in emerging market economies as they catch up toward the income levels of advanced economies. Projections of economic growth over the next 30 years determine the expected growth of future emissions and therefore the scale of effort needed to keep temperature increases to 1.5–2°C. However, most existing scenarios (IPCC 2014, 2018a) indicate that, under unchanged policies, carbon emissions will continue growing strongly, lead- ing to temperature increases well above the safe levels agreed to in the Paris Agreement and raising the risk of catastrophic damage for the planet. As the simulations show, however, an initial green investment push combined with steadily rising carbon prices would deliver the needed emission reductions at reasonable output effects. Under the policy package, global carbon emissions are reduced by about 75 percent from current levels, reach- ing about 9 gigatons by mid-century (Figure 3.5).

Over the long term, temperature increases are kept down to 2°C after some modest initial overshooting. Thus, the policy package allows avoiding much of the severe damage from climate change and especially the risk of catastrophic outcomes, putting the global economy on a higher and sustainable income path from the second half of the century (see below). A closer look over the next 30 years shows that the costs of the transition are moderate and that both a green fiscal stimulus and carbon pricing play key roles (Figure 3.6). The policy package delivers a net positive effect on global growth in the initial years, suggesting that it can support the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. After 15 years, GDP is lower by up to about 1 percent relative to its baseline level under unchanged policies. The estimated transitional GDP costs in this chapter’s simulation are within the range of other stud- ies (1–6 percent of GDP by 2050), albeit on the lower side of estimates—reflecting the support to activity from green infrastructure investment and higher substitutabil- ity between high- and low-carbon energy in G-Cubed than in engineering-based models (see Chapter 6 of IPCC 2014). These are moderate output losses in the context of the expected 120 percent cumulative global GDP growth over the next 30 years (Figure 3.6, panels 2 and 3). From mid-century on, the benefits of climate mitigation in the form of avoided damage grow larger, and the policy package boosts GDP and growth sub- stantially above their baseline levels (Figure 3.7). Closer examination of the effects of different tools employed in the policy package shows their comple- mentary roles: •• Emission reductions: While the green fiscal stimulus helps reduce emissions meaningfully, its effect is much smaller than that of carbon pricing. The latter is a powerful tool to generate rapid and substantial emission reductions because it is effective at increas- ing energy efficiency, while green supply policies lower the overall energy price and boost energy consumption (Figure 3.6, panel 1). •• Economic costs: Whereas carbon pricing lowers real GDP by increasing the cost of energy, the green fiscal stimulus boosts it, both directly and indirectly (Figure 3.6, panel 2). First, the green fiscal stimulus directly adds to GDP through higher investment spending. Second, it indirectly reduces the output costs of the transition to a low-carbon economy by lowering future carbon emissions and the level of carbon taxes needed to meet the emission reduction targets. The green stimulus first boosts economic activity by increasing aggregate demand; thereafter the green infrastructure investment boosts the produc- tivity of the low-carbon sectors, incentivizing more private investment in these sectors and increasing the potential output of the economy. Its effects are large enough to comfortably offset the economic cost of the carbon tax in the initial years. As a result, the pol- icy package raises output in the first 15 years by about 0.7 percent of global GDP each year (on average over that period). After 15 years the drag from the carbon tax is larger, resulting in small net output losses. The net drag of the policy package on global output—of about 0.7 percent, on average, between 2036–50, and slightly more than 1 percent by 2050—appears manageable in the context of an expected cumulative increase in real GDP of 120 percent over the next 30 years. Average annual growth, after being higher in the 2020s thanks to the green fiscal stimulus, is lower by only one-tenth of a percentage point in the 2030s and by less than one-tenth of a percentage point in the 2040s (Figure 3.6, panel 3). Over time, the economy benefits from avoiding damages from climate change—such as lower productivity due to higher temperatures and more frequent natural disasters—meaning that output would be higher relative to what it would have been under unchanged policies. Estimates of damages from climate change vary with the assumed response of temperatures to the accumulated carbon stock and with methodol- ogies used to relate economic damages to tempera- tures. The more recent studies (for example, Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel 2015) point to much larger damages than previously estimated and are more in line with the substantial risks scientists have warned about.33 Based on these estimates, the projected net output gains from mitigating climate change increase rapidly after 2050, reaching up to 13 per- cent of global GDP by 2100 (Figure 3.7). However, even these estimates are likely to understate benefits from mitigating climate change as they imperfectly take account of—or do not incorporate—some of the damages related to temperature increases, such as 33The large difference between the various measures comes from uncertainty over two aspects of the costs of climate change: first, whether temperature increases affect the level of output (as in Nordhaus 2010) or its growth rate (as in Dell, Jones, and Olken 2012; and Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel 2015); second, whether the relationships observed in historical data between temperature and output can be relied upon in the future (especially when these are nonlinear). Over long forecast horizons, different stances on these two aspects can lead to very big differences in the costs of climate change and the gains from climate mitigation. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-115-2048.jpg) ![CHAPTER 3 MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE—GROWTH- AND DISTRIBUTION-FRIENDLY STRATEGIES 97International Monetary Fund | October 2020 (1) Baseline (2) 1 + Deviation of infrastructure (3) 2 + Deviation of green subsidy Avoid damage Carbon tax Green subsidy Infrastructure Simulation total Transfer (4) 3 + Deviation of transfer (5) 4 + Deviation of carbon tax (6) 5 + Deviation of avoid damage Avoid damage Carbon tax Green subsidy Infrastructure Simulation total Transfer Gas Oil and petroleum Coal Construction Agriculture, forestry, and other mining Manufacturing Transportation Services Renewables Other low-carbon Net effect Simulation total Baseline (real GDP) Baseline (employment) Figure 3.6.

Carbon tax revenues are thereafter broadly sufficient to finance the additional green infrastructure and transfers to poor households (Figure 3.6, panel 4). The effects of the climate change mitigation policy package on global employment follow largely those on output (Figure 3.6, panel 5). Employment is boosted initially. Global employment would be higher by a total of 12 million people, on average, each year between 2021 and 2027, followed by a small decline relative to the baseline employment path during the transition until the economy reaches a higher output and growth path. Despite the decline relative to baseline, employment continues to grow strongly throughout the period (Figure 3.6, panel 3). Expanding low-carbon sectors, such as renewable energy, retrofitting of buildings, electric car production, and the services sector, are typically more labor intensive than the shrinking high-carbon sectors (such as fossil fuel energy, transportation, heavy man- ufacturing)—both in the short and long term—and can create many jobs (Figure 3.8). However, the policy package scenario entails a substantial reallocation of about 2 percent of jobs from high- to low-carbon sectors, which could cause difficult transitions for some workers and require reskilling and government support (see below). Turning to private investment, the policy package leads to a sharp global contraction because the carbon tax acts as a negative wealth shock and reduces the long-term desired capital stock (Figure 3.6, panel 6). The expanding low-carbon sectors (renewables, ser- vices) are also less capital intensive than the contracting Nordhaus 2010 Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel 2015 Climate change mitigation results in substantial output gains in the second half of the century.

Finally, the renewable energy sector is smaller than the fossil fuel sector and takes time to expand due to capital adjust- ment costs, although green infrastructure investment and subsidies help incentivize private investment in renewables and other low-carbon energy sectors.34 Some variation is seen across countries and regions: reductions in private investment are especially large in countries with larger fossil fuel sectors, whereas the policy package elicits more positive responses from private investment where low-carbon energy sectors are already large and the cost of ramping up physical capital relatively low (for example, Europe and Japan; see below). In the current context of depressed private investment and very low interest rates, green support policies could also have a more positive effect on pri- vate investment in the near term than modeled here. To sum up, a mix of carbon pricing and an initial green stimulus would help with economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis in the near term while putting the global economy on a sustainable growth path at moderate transitional growth costs. The green fiscal easing would help boost growth and employment in the first few years, when the economy is depressed, despite the introduction of the carbon tax. From a macroeconomic and public finance perspective, the next decade is the best time for governments to invest and borrow, given that interest rates for many large emitters are likely to stay low for long, suggesting that an aggressive investment policy would be affordable and desirable. As the recovery takes hold, further increases in carbon taxes would be essential to generate the needed substantial declines in emissions and would imply only moderate growth costs. Over the longer term, the economy would be on a higher growth and output path because substantial damages from climate change would be avoided. Cross-Country Differences While the transitional output costs associated with the policy package are relatively moderate in global terms, they are very different across countries (Figure 3.9, panel 1). Some of the advanced economies may experience smaller economic costs throughout the transition—or 34In the G-Cubed model, investors are forward looking, and substitutability is high relative to other models (McKibbin and Wilcoxen 1999, 2013; Liu and others 2020). even gain, as does Europe. The more renewables there are already in the economy, the higher the initial capital stocks, so the more they can be ramped up without incurring large adjustment costs.35 Europe starts with a large renewable sector, implying that the adjustment costs per unit of additional investment are much lower than for other countries.36 In contrast, the United States and China have a large amount of fossil fuel capital relative to non-fossil-fuel capital, and the investment reductions from these industries offset the investment in renewables, which face larger adjustment costs to ramp up. Countries with fast economic or population growth (India, especially; China, to a lesser extent) and most oil producers are bound to experience larger economic costs by forgoing cheap forms of energy, such as coal or oil. These output costs nevertheless remain modest relative to baseline growth for most. For example, with the pol- icy package, India’s GDP would be 277 percent higher in 2050 than today, only moderately below what it would have been with unchanged policies (287 percent). But more important, these economic costs also need to be weighed against avoided damage from climate change and co-benefits from climate change mitigation. The countries for which economic costs are larger are also the ones that would enjoy immediate substan- tial co-benefits from acting to curb carbon emissions (Figure 3.9, panel 2). These are reductions in mortal- ity risks and improved health from less air pollution (thanks to lower use of coal and natural gas) and reduced road congestion, traffic accident risk, and road damage (associated with taxation of gasoline and road diesel). While the value of saving lives goes well beyond economic gains and quantifying the economic value of human life and health is difficult, existing valuations (see, for example, the October 2019 Fiscal Monitor; and Parry, Veung, and Heine 2015) indicate that many countries would experience substantial eco- nomic gains from co-benefits—on the order of 0.7 per- cent of GDP immediately and 3.5 percent of GDP by 2050 for China, and 0.3 percent immediately and 1.4 percent by 2050 for India.37 Combining real GDP 35This is because adjustment costs are quadratic in the rate of investment. 36IMF (2020a) examines climate mitigation scenarios for the European Union using the Envisage CGE model. It con- cludes that a higher carbon price is needed for Europe’s climate mitigation objectives and that a subsidy for renewables produc- tion would allow the needed carbon price to be reduced. The new European Union recovery fund explicitly aims to address climate change. 37Parry, Veung, and Heine (2015) estimates a price on CO2 that would internalize domestic non-climate-related external costs ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-118-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 100 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 associated with fossil fuels around the world. The nationally efficient CO2 price level is, on average, $57.5 a ton (in 2010)—and ranges between $11 and $85 for the countries/regions in the G-Cubed model. These reflect primarily health co-benefits from reduced air pollution at coal plants and, in some cases, reductions in automo- bile externalities. The co-benefits differ across countries per unit of abatement and are largest for Russia and China. See Karlsson, Alfredsson, and Westling (2020) for a review of available monetary estimates of air quality co-benefits. Based on quasi-experimental evidence from China, Ebenstein and others (2017) finds that an increase of 10 micrograms a cubic meter in PM10 (particulate matter under 10 micrometers in size) reduces life expectancy by 0.64 year and, consequently, bringing all of China into compliance with its Class I standard for PM10 would save 3.7 billion life-years. In addition to the benefit of reduced mortality, studies also show significant benefits from reduced morbidity (that is, lower health care spending) in response to environmental policies. For example, reducing PM2.5 (particulate matter under 2.5 micrometers in size) concentration in China from the prevailing average to the World Health Organization–recommended level (which is about one-sixth the current average level) would reduce health care spending by $42 billion relative to 2015 spending levels, or about 7 percent of national annual health care spending (see, for example, Barwick and others 2018).

Therefore, all coun- tries would experience substantial benefits from avoided climate damages in the second half of the century under the policy package. The benefits from mitigating climate change are expected to be particularly large for some of the countries with higher transitional costs. India is among those likely to suffer the greatest dam- age from global warming, reflecting its initially high temperatures. For India, the net gains from climate change mitigation—relative to inaction—would be up to 60–80 percent of GDP by 2100 (Figure 3.9, panel 4). While estimates of losses from climate change are somewhat smaller for colder regions (for example, Europe, North America, and east Asia), these are likely underestimations as they do not include a number of damages (for example, rise in sea levels, natural disas- ters, damage to infrastructure from thawing of perma- frost in Russia) and negative global spillovers from large economic disruptions in other parts of the world. It is sometimes argued that countries that have contributed the bulk of the stock of global carbon emissions—advanced economies—should shoulder a greater part of the mitigation burden. Advanced econo- mies cannot keep global temperatures to safe levels on their own, as their share in global emissions is set to drop to 23 percent in 2050 from 32 percent of global emissions under unchanged policies. And in a scenario in which only advanced economies enact mitigation policies, the decline in their emissions would be par- tially offset by an increase in other countries’ emissions relative to the baseline. This reflects two types of “leakages”: first, lower demand from advanced econ- omies for fossil fuels depresses global fossil fuel prices and so increases their consumption by other countries; and second, some carbon-intensive activities previously carried out in advanced economies are likely to relocate to countries where carbon is not taxed. In a scenario in which advanced economies are the only ones that reduce their gross carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, global emissions still increase 38Bento, Jacobsen, and Liu (2018) also points out that the costs of implementing a carbon tax are substantially lower with a large infor- mal sector as the carbon tax lowers the relative distortion between the formal and informal sectors—given that even the informal sector must buy energy from the formal sector, these mechanisms can lead to welfare-enhancing expansion of the formal sector. to 48 gigatons by 2050, well above current levels (Figure 3.10). In contrast, if the United States, Europe, China, Japan, and India—as the five largest countries (economic region)—act together, they can make a large dent in global emissions over the next three decades.

The October 2019 Fiscal Mon- itor discusses how a carbon price floor among the largest emitters—possibly with a lower price floor or transfers for lower-income countries—would be an effective arrange- ment to scale up Paris Agreement commitments. It would provide a transparent target based on a common measure and help reassure against potential losses in international competitiveness from higher energy costs. Fossil fuel exporters are bound to experience the largest economic losses from the transition of the global economy to a low-carbon path (see Mirzoev and others 2020 for a discussion of carbon transition risks in Gulf Cooperation Council countries). Even without a domes- tic carbon tax, the fall in global demand for fossil fuels would significantly lower these economies’ fiscal revenues and economic activity. Moreover, the industrial struc- ture in many fuel exporters is reliant on cheap energy, making the required restructuring and diversification of these economies more difficult and painful. Imposing an export tax (royalty) on oil sales—if this could be agreed upon among oil producers—could maximize the revenue extracted from oil reserves (while demand lasts) and at the same time contribute to the decarbonization of other economies (see the October 2019 Fiscal Monitor). Many oil exporters, however, also stand to gain from global climate change mitigation measures. For example, rising temperatures will make oil-exporting countries in the Middle East, where water scarcity is already a growing concern, even hotter. Many oil-exporting countries have recognized the challenges that are being created by the energy transition and are actively seeking to diversify their economies away from the reliance on oil. Poli- cies that seek to strengthen the non-oil sector through better business regulation, greater credit availability, and reforms to the labor market, and increase sources of non- oil revenue for the government, are being implemented. The Returns to Supporting Technological Innovation The response of technology (“endogenous technical change”) to carbon taxes or research and development subsidies is important in amplifying the effects of carbon pricing and facilitating the low-carbon transition. Given that this mechanism is difficult to integrate into the G-Cubed model, this chapter uses the more stylized representation of Hassler and others (2020) to illus- trate the impact of supporting technological innovation (Figure 3.11; see Online Annex 3.5). Assuming a plausible response of technological change to the price of carbon— and combining it with a subsidy (of 70 percent) for green research and development—would allow a similar emission target to be achieved with a carbon price path at about half the prices required in the G-Cubed scenario. In the presence of endogenous technical change and research and development subsidies, the transitional costs of miti- gation policies are therefore significantly lower, and global GDP rises toward baseline earlier (around the mid-2040s) than in the absence of innovation. The beneficial impact of this policy is felt mostly in the medium to longer term (after 2030), as the inno- vation response and the diffusion of new knowledge through the global economy take time to materialize.39 39The immediate effects of this policy are limited by the modest initial size of the green energy sector. High carbon tax and green ﬁscal stimulus Plus research and development subsidies and endogenous technical change and lower carbon tax Figure 3.11.

Note: The panels compare the G-Cubed simulation of the comprehensive policy package with a simulation run using an extension of the Hassler and others (2020) integrated assessment model with endogenous technological change.

Research and development subsidies on their own, however, could not generate the quick and substantial reductions in emissions needed to keep temperature increases to safe levels.40 A good example of the role of technology in reduc- ing emissions is the electricity sector, which, together with heating, generates roughly 40 percent of total 40See also, for example, Bosetti and others (2011), Newell (2015), and Dechezleprêtre and Popp (2017). global carbon emissions (Figure 3.12). Three-quarters of these emissions are from coal-based electricity gener- ation. Raising the share of renewables in the electricity sector is considered the first step toward decarboniza- tion because substitute low-carbon technologies are already available and are economically competitive as a result of a dramatic decline in prices in the past decade—for example, the cost of electricity from wind has declined by 70 percent (Lazard 2019). This makes near-term emission-output trade-offs particularly favorable in this sector, which is also reflected in the G-Cubed simulation, in which about two-thirds of emission reductions in the first 10 years are achieved in electricity generation. Moreover, low-carbon electric- ity production would generate additional benefits for decarbonization as other end-uses of energy (auto- mobiles, heating, and so on) are electrified. Box 3.2 investigates in more detail how emissions in the elec- tricity sector can be reduced with existing technologies (see also Online Annex 3.6). How to Build Inclusion Underlying the moderate macroeconomic effects of mitigation policies discussed in the previous section are differentiated impacts on low- and high-income households and on workers in shrinking versus expanding sectors (such as fossil fuel extraction and manufacturing versus clean-energy and services sec- tors). For instance, in the absence of compensatory measures, low-income households are more likely than high-income households to be hurt by carbon pricing; in many countries the poor spend a rela- tively larger share of their income on energy-intensive goods, such as electricity and heating (Figure 3.13, panel 1). Low-income households are also more likely to experience losses in labor income, given that they tend to be employed in low-skill occupations in carbon-intensive sectors (manufacturing, transporta- tion, energy; Figure 3.13, panel 2). Opinion surveys suggest that low-skilled workers are less likely than high-skilled workers to favor protecting the envi- ronment over boosting economic growth. Support for protection of the environment is lowest among lower-skilled workers employed in carbon-intensive sectors (Figure 3.14).41 The distributional impacts of carbon pricing are likely to vary by country. Carbon pricing is not always regressive, especially in emerging market and 41See also IMF (forthcoming).

Similarly, the distributional impact through the labor income channel can vary across countries. But where carbon pricing is likely to adversely affect vulnerable households and workers, building fairness and inclu- sion will be crucial to the political acceptability and sustainability of mitigation strategies. Various policies can limit the adverse effects of higher carbon prices on households. These include fully or partially rebating the carbon pricing revenues through universal or targeted cash transfers—or using some of the revenue to finance higher public spend- ing in low-carbon sectors, which will create jobs and offset employment losses in carbon-intensive sectors. Among the different options for cash transfers, tar- geted compensation for low-income households is a cost-effective option. Figure 3.13, panel 3, shows the consumption impact of a tax of $50/ton of CO2 under various revenue recycling options, based on a general equilibrium model with heterogenous agents calibrated to the United States and China that incorporates the carbon tax’s impact on consumption and employment (see Online Annex 3.7 and Tavares, forthcoming). Simulations suggest that fully recycling carbon tax rev- enues in cash transfers targeted to low-income groups (bottom two quintiles) can raise their consumption (see Figure 3.13, panel 3, and Online Annex 3.7 for the impact on the entire consumption distribution). The consumption of households in the lowest quin- tile could be protected (consumption kept broadly constant) by redistributing about one-quarter and one-sixth of the carbon revenues, respectively, to this group of households in the United States and China. By contrast, it would take, respectively, 55 percent and 40 percent of revenues to protect consumption levels of households in the lowest two quintiles in the United States and China. Fully rebating the carbon revenues through universal transfers would also broadly avert a decline in the consumption of households in the bot- tom two quintiles, but at a much higher fiscal cost.42 While they both protect private consumption, neither universal nor targeted cash transfers help 42Iran’s 2010 fuel subsidy reform and the introduction of carbon pricing in British Columbia are examples of successful reforms that included compensatory transfers to households (among other measures). See Guillaume, Zytek, and Farzin (2011) and Carl and Fedor (2016). materially ease job transitions. By contrast, increas- ing government spending on low-carbon goods and services—similar in spirit to the green supply policies studied in the previous section—would fail to protect the consumption of poorer households but would prevent a decline in aggregate employment and spur further reallocation of workers toward low-carbon sectors (Figure 3.13, panel 4). In practice, governments seeking to introduce car- bon pricing will likely face calls to protect low-income households from higher prices and compensate for job losses in carbon-intensive industries. The simulations here show that carbon pricing can produce enough revenue to spend on both goals if income support is well targeted. Feebates are an essential complement to other mit- igation policies. They are systems of fees and rebates on products or activities with above- or below-average emission intensity, or regulations (such as emission rates or energy efficiency standards) that can be used when carbon pricing is not feasible or cannot be imposed on the necessary scale (October 2019 Fiscal Monitor). Feebates can be tailored to specific markets, and their impact on emissions depends on the size and energy intensity of the target market. Feebates are modeled broadly here as consisting of a tax of $50/ton of CO2 imposed on the dirty energy consumption of firms and households, with the revenue used to finance a subsidy to promote the consumption of clean energy. The only way in which this experiment differs from the previous one is that the revenue is spent on subsidies to promote the consumption of clean energy. The revenue-raising component (carbon tax) is similar. Simulations show that the effects of the feebates on the consumption of the bottom quintile and inequal- ity are smaller than when carbon taxes are imposed, if no action is taken to mitigate the impact on the distribution (Figure 3.15). The effects are smaller because the impact on energy prices is minimal (taxes and subsidies are levied on different varieties of the same good) and because feebates stimulate employ- ment for low-skilled workers, on net (given that the renewable sector is more labor intensive than the dirty energy sector). Finally, mitigation policies are likely to affect some communities more than others, adding a geographic dimension to inequality. A just transition is needed also for the most hard-hit communities and regions and may require—beyond reskilling of workers— effective government support for those communities. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-124-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Long and Difficult Ascent 106 International Monetary Fund | October 2020 Conclusion The window for attaining net zero emissions by 2050 and holding temperature increases to safe levels is rapidly closing. The analysis in this chapter suggests that an initial green investment push combined with steadily rising carbon prices would deliver the needed emission reductions at reasonable transitional global output effects. A green fiscal stimulus would strengthen the macroeconomy in the short term and help lower the costs of adjusting to higher carbon prices. Carbon pricing is critical to mitigation because higher carbon prices incentivize energy efficiency in addition to real- locating resources from high- to low-carbon activities. The transitional costs of carbon pricing consistent with net zero emissions by mid-century would be manageable in the context of the projected growth of the global economy over the next three decades and could be reduced further as technological innova- tions develop in response to carbon pricing and green research and development subsidies. In the medium term, such a strategy would place the global economy on a stronger and more sustainable growth path by avoiding serious damages from climate change and the risk of catastrophic outcomes. Keeping global temperatures to safe levels requires a global effort. Advanced economies cannot successfully mitigate climate change by themselves, as they account for a declining share of global emissions. By con- trast, the five largest countries/economic union—the United States, China, the European Union, Japan, and India—acting jointly can make a large dent in global emissions. While the economic costs of mitigation vary across countries, all stand to gain greatly from avoided damages from climate change and co-benefits from mitigation, such as reduced pollution and mortality. Building sustainably now, rather than having to rebuild infrastructure later, would lower the transitional costs of mitigation. For fossil fuel exporters, smoothing the transition will require accelerating the diversification of their economies. This chapter set out to examine the macroeconomic impacts of climate change mitigation policies. Another important issue is international coor- dination, which could offer scope for different burden sharing of mitigation costs. International policy coordi- nation on climate change deserves further study—given how elusive it has been for countries to come together and take meaningful action to reduce emissions (see, for example, Barrett 2005, 2013, 2016; Lessmann and others 2015; Nordhaus 2015). Analysis on how to achieve such cooperation is, however, outside the scope of this chapter. Last but not least, decarbonization involves a structural transformation of economies, with unequal impacts across population subgroups. To build inclu- sion and ensure the broadest possible support for mitigation policies, governments can use part of their carbon tax revenues to support job transitions and provide targeted cash transfers to protect poorer house- holds against losses in purchasing power. Place-based policies to compensate areas or regions likely to expe- rience more labor shedding due to a retrenchment in high-carbon sectors may also be needed.

The main greenhouse gas, produced from burning fossil fuels, manufacturing cement, and forestry practices. CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere for an average of 100 years. Carbon tax. A tax imposed on CO2 emissions released largely through the combustion of carbon-based fossil fuels. Administratively, implementation is easiest by taxing the supply of fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—in proportion to their carbon content. Clean energy innovation. The number of patent applications in climate change mitigation technolo- gies related to energy generation, transmission, and distribution. Co-benefits.

Distribution-friendly policy. A policy that attempts to mitigate the policy’s negative effects on low-income groups’ consumption (or some other measure of household well-being). Economies of scale. Cost advantages for businesses as a result of their scale of operation, with unit costs of output decreasing with increasing scale. Emission trading system. A market-based policy to reduce emissions (sometimes referred to as “cap and trade”). Covered sources are required to hold allowances for each ton of their emissions or (in an upstream program) the embodied emission content in fuels. The total quantity of allowances is fixed, and market trading of allowances establishes a market price for emissions. Auctioning the allowances is a valuable source of government revenue. Externality. A cost imposed by the actions of individ- uals or firms on other individuals or firms (possibly in the future, as in the case of climate change) that the former does not take into account. Feebate. A sliding scale of fees on firms with emission rates (for example, CO2 per kilowatt-hour) above a “pivot point” level and corresponding subsidies for firms with emission rates below the pivot point. Alternatively, a feebate can be applied to energy consumption rates (for example, gasoline per mile driven) rather than emission rates. Feebates can exploit many (but not all) of the mitigation opportunities promoted by carbon taxes but without a large increase in energy prices. Feed-in tariffs. Long-term contracts that guarantee producers of renewable electricity a fixed price for every unit of electricity delivered to the grid. Gray technologies. Technologies that tend to improve the pollution effect of “dirty” technologies. Examples include technologies that use the heat from fuel or waste incineration or fuels from nonfossil sources. Green supply policies. Policies aimed at boosting the supply of renewable energy and energy efficiency, including subsidies and investment programs. Green/white certificates. Titles, respectively, for reaching renewable energy/energy saving targets. Greenhouse gas. A gas in the atmosphere that allows incoming solar radiation to pass through but traps and absorbs heat radiated from Earth. CO2 is easily the most predominant greenhouse gas. High-carbon activities. Activities that either involve generation of carbon-based energy or emit relatively high amounts of CO2. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Climate strategies, including mitigation commitments, submitted by 190 parties to the Paris Agreement. Countries are required to report progress on imple- menting NDCs every two years and (from 2020 onward) to submit revised NDCs (which are expected to contain progressively more stringent mitigation pledges) every five years. Paris Agreement. An international accord (ratified in 2016) on climate mitigation, adaptation, and financ- ing. The agreement’s central objective is to contain global average temperature increases to 1.5–2°C above preindustrial levels. Renewable energy. Typically includes energy gen- erated from solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric sources. Hydroelectric is often subdivided into “large” and “small” because of the major environmental impact of the former. Research and development. Innovative activities by corporations and governments with the goal of devel- oping new products and technologies. Revenue recycling. Use of (carbon) tax revenues for purposes such as lowering other taxes on households and firms or funding public investment. Box 3.1.

To this end, the analysis modifies the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (Laxton and others 2010) to include an electricity sector where power is generated from coal, natural gas, renewables or by nuclear or hydro- electric processes. The constraints that intermittency of renewables (the undesired output variation from the varying availability of sun and wind) pose for their market penetration are captured by pairing renewable electricity generation with a flexible backup capacity that covers output shortfalls (see Online Annex 3.6; all annexes are available at www​.imf​.org/​en/​Publications/​ WEO). Studying the same illustrative $50 carbon price in the United States, Europe, and China allows for highlighting how a country’s current electricity mix and economic structure affect the impact of introduc- ing a carbon price. Simulations for the United States show that even a moderate policy of gradually introducing a $50 carbon price over 10 years in the electricity sector, flanked by a front-loaded subsidy for investment in renewables, would unlock substantial decarbonization of the elec- tricity sector at very small output costs (Figure 3.2.1, panels 1–3). The policy mix is budget neutral when the carbon price is fully in place after 10 years, and its revenues (roughly 0.2 percent of GDP) are enough to finance the subsidy. However, before revenues fully emerge, the subsidy is financed through debt, leading to a total increase in the debt-to-output ratio of roughly 1 percent of GDP. The carbon price discriminates according to the carbon intensity of the different technologies, thereby disadvantaging electricity production using coal (and to a lesser extent gas). Accentuated by a decline in renewable prices due to the subsidy, the change in relative prices leads to a rebalancing of the electricity mix away from coal toward renewables technologies, and electricity sector emissions decline by 35 percent relative to baseline by 2030 as a result. The decline of gas is dampened by its role as a backup capacity for renewable electricity. While investment and employment decline in the coal sector, the subsidy triggers a surge in invest- ment in renewables, offsetting a large portion of The authors of this box are Benjamin Carton and Simon Voigts.

Simulation of a $50 tax per ton of carbon dioxide, phased in over 10 years, alone and together with a policy package. The policy package includes, in each of the three regions, frontloaded renewables investment subsidies and, in the short term, an accommodative monetary policy. For China, the policy package also includes a doubling of nuclear and hydro capacities over 20 years. Figure 3.2.1.

Therefore, the policy mix greatly reduces emissions, while economic damage is mitigated (output declines below baseline by ½ percent over 10 years) as the economy adjusts by reallocating labor and investment from coal toward renewables. The European Union is comparably advanced in its electricity transition (coal and renewables both have a share of about 20 percent). At the same time, the share of natural gas is considerably smaller than in the United States, which constrains further expansion of renewables by making the grid comparably less flexible to accommodate a rise in intermittent electricity gener- ation. With less room to cut coal output and more lim- ited means for renewables to expand, the carbon price achieves a somewhat milder reduction in emissions. The high share of coal-generated electricity in China—almost 70 percent—amplifies the increase in electricity costs caused by the carbon price, in turn leading to a more pronounced decline in output. The carbon price increases the share of renewables by about 20 percentage points, which alone is not enough to reduce the share of coal to a sustainable level. With limited availability of natural gas, renew- ables must be backed up by coal itself (assuming the possibility of flexibility retrofits, as discussed in IEA 2019), reducing the scope for reductions. In addition to renewables subsidies, the macroeconomic package assumes an expansion in nuclear power (accounting for the time it takes to build plants), which crowds out coal-based generation. While the percentage decline in emissions is of the same order as in other regions, in absolute terms, it is about three times greater than in the United States owing to China’s greater initial emissions. Overall, the policy is highly effective at curbing electricity-related emissions at modest macroeconomic costs, especially if labor reallocation can be facili- tated. Storage technology for renewable electricity, which could become feasible in the near term, would amplify the penetration of renewables resulting from the carbon price. Given that the macroeconomic costs of a low-carbon electricity transition are modest, it is striking that current policy action and plans for the phasing out of coal generally fall short of what is needed to avoid irreversible climate damage. According to the International Energy Agency, under current and proposed investment plans and policies, power generation from coal alone would use up most of the remaining carbon budget (IEA 2019).

It comprises seven sections: Assumptions, What’s New, Data and Conventions, Country Notes, General Features and Composition of Groups in the World Economic Outlook Classification, Key Data Documentation, and Statistical Tables. The first section summarizes the assumptions underlying the estimates and projections for 2020–21. The second section briefly describes the changes to the database and statistical tables since the April 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO). The third section offers a general description of the data and the conven- tions used for calculating country group composites. The fourth section presents selected key information for each country. The fifth section summarizes the clas- sification of countries in the various groups presented in the WEO. The sixth section provides information on methods and reporting standards for the member countries’ national account and government finance indicators included in the report. The last, and main, section comprises the statisti- cal tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included here; Statistical Appendix B is available online at www.imf​ .org/en/Publications/WEO.) Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis of information available through September 28, 2020. The figures for 2020–21 are shown with the same degree of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree of accuracy is not to be inferred. Assumptions Real effective exchange rates for the advanced econo- mies are assumed to remain constant at their average levels measured during July 24–August 21, 2020. For 2020 and 2021 these assumptions imply average US dollar–special drawing right (SDR) conversion rates of 1.391 and 1.430, US dollar–euro conversion rates of 1.143 and 1.230, and yen–US dollar conversion rates of 107.2 and 105.9, respectively. It is assumed that the price of oil will average $41.69 a barrel in 2020 and $46.70 a barrel in 2021. National authorities’ established policies are assumed to be maintained. Box A1 describes the more specific policy assumptions underlying the projections for selected economies. With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on six-month US dollar deposits will average 0.7 percent in 2020 and 0.4 percent in 2021, the LIBOR on three-month euro deposits will average –0.4 percent in 2020 and –0.5 percent in 2021, and the LIBOR on six-month yen deposits will average 0.0 percent in 2020 and 2021. As a reminder, in regard to the introduction of the euro, on December 31, 1998, the Council of the Euro- pean Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro and currencies of the member countries adopting the euro are as described in Box 5.4 of the October 1998 WEO. See Box 5.4 of the October 1998 WEO as well for details on how the conversion rates were established. 1 euro = 13.7603 Austrian schillings = 40.3399 Belgian francs = 0.585274 Cyprus pound1 = 1.95583 Deutsche marks = 15.6466 Estonian krooni2 = 5.94573 Finnish markkaa = 6.55957 French francs = 340.750 Greek drachmas3 = 0.787564 Irish pound = 1,936.27 Italian lire = 0.702804 Latvian lat4 = 3.45280 Lithuanian litas5 = 40.3399 Luxembourg francs = 0.42930 Maltese lira1 = 2.20371 Netherlands guilders = 200.482 Portuguese escudos = 30.1260 Slovak koruna6 = 239.640 Slovenian tolars7 = 166.386 Spanish pesetas 1Established on January 1, 2008. 2Established on January 1, 2011. 3Established on January 1, 2001. 4Established on January 1, 2014. 5Established on January 1, 2015. 6Established on January 1, 2009. 7Established on January 1, 2007. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-134-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A LONG AND DIFFICULT ASCENT 116 International Monetary Fund|October 2020 What’s New • Following the recent release of the 2017 Interna- tional Comparison Program (ICP) survey for new purchasing-power-parity benchmarks, the WEO’s estimates of purchasing-power-parity weights and GDP valued at purchasing power parity have been updated. For more details, see Box 1.1 of the October 2020 WEO. • Starting with the October 2020 WEO, data and forecasts for Bangladesh and Tonga are presented on a fiscal year basis. • Data for West Bank and Gaza are now included in the WEO. West Bank and Gaza is added to the Middle East and Central Asia regional group. Data and Conventions Data and projections for 195 economies form the statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department and regional departments, with the latter regularly updating country projections based on consistent global assumptions. Although national statistical agencies are the ultimate providers of historical data and definitions, international organizations are also involved in statisti- cal issues, with the objective of harmonizing meth- odologies for the compilation of national statistics, including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions, classifications, and valuation procedures used in the production of economic statistics. The WEO database reflects information from both national source agencies and international organizations. Most countries’ macroeconomic data as presented in the WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). The IMF’s sector statistical standards—the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide (MFSMCG), and the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014)—have been aligned with the SNA 2008. These standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’ external positions, financial sector stabil- ity, and public sector fiscal positions. The process of adapting country data to the new standards begins in earnest when the manuals are released. However, full concordance with the manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision by national statistical compilers of revised country data; hence, the WEO estimates are only partly adapted to these manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries, conversion to the updated standards will have only a small impact on major balances and aggregates. Many other countries have partly adopted the latest standards and will continue implementation over a number of years.1 The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF staff estimates. While attempts are made to align gross and net debt data with the definitions in the GFSM, as a result of data limitations or specific country circum- stances, these data can sometimes deviate from the formal definitions. Although every effort is made to ensure the WEO data are relevant and internationally comparable, differences in both sectoral and instru- ment coverage mean that the data are not universally comparable. As more information becomes available, changes in either data sources or instrument cover- age can give rise to data revisions that can sometimes be substantial. For clarification on the deviations in sectoral or instrument coverage, please refer to the metadata for the online WEO database. Composite data for country groups in the WEO are either sums or weighted averages of data for individual countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates of change.2 Arithmetically weighted averages are used for all data for the emerging market and developing economies group—except data on inflation and money growth, for which geometric averages are used. The following conventions apply: Country group composites for exchange rates, inter- est rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three years) as a share of group GDP. Composites for other data relating to the domestic economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share 1 Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European System of National and Regional Accounts 2010, and a few coun- tries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993. A similar adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM 2014. Please refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards each country adheres to. 2 Averages for real GDP, inflation, GDP per capita, and commodity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of change, except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based on the simple arithmetic average. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-135-2048.jpg) ![STATISTICAL APPENDIX International Monetary Fund|October 2020 117 of total world or group GDP.3 Annual inflation rates are simple percentage changes from the previous years, except in the case of emerging market and developing economies, for which the rates are based on logarith- mic differences. Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasing power parity terms are sums of individual country data after conversion to the international dollar in the years indicated. Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepan- cies in intra-area transactions. Unadjusted annual GDP data are used for the euro area and for the majority of individual countries, except for Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit exchange rates. Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated. Composite unemployment rates and employment growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group labor force. Composites relating to external sector statistics are sums of individual country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated for balance of payments data. Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent changes for individual countries weighted by the US dollar value of exports or imports as a share of total world or group exports or imports (in the preceding year). Unless noted otherwise, group composites are computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group weights is represented. Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the econ- omies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and government finance data for each country. For some countries, the figures for 2019 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns; Table G lists the latest actual outturns for the 3 See Box 1.1 of the October 2020 WEO for a summary of the revised purchasing-power-parity-based weights as well as “Revised Purchasing Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014 WEO Update, Box A2 of the April 2004 WEO, Box A1 of the May 2000 WEO, and Annex IV of the May 1993 WEO.

Country Notes For Albania, projections were prepared prior to the first Post-Program Monitoring mission that ended on September 28 and therefore do not reflect updates made during the mission. For Argentina, fiscal and inflation variables are excluded from publication for 2021–25 and 2020–25, respectively, as these are to a large extent linked to still- pending program negotiations. The official national consumer price index (CPI) for Argentina starts in December 2016. For earlier periods, CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (prior to December 2013), the national CPI (IPCNu, December 2013 to October 2015), the City of Buenos Aires CPI (November 2015 to April 2016), and the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (May 2016 to Decem- ber 2016). Given limited comparability of these series on account of differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the average CPI inflation for 2014–16 and end-of-period inflation for 2015–16 are not reported in the October 2020 WEO. Also, Argentina discontinued the publication of labor market data in December 2015 and new series became available starting in the second quarter of 2016. For Australia, projections do not reflect the October 6 Commonwealth budget, which was released after the cutoff date (September 28) for the October 2020 WEO. Data and forecasts for Bangladesh are presented on a fiscal year basis starting with the October 2020 WEO. However, the real GDP and purchasing-power-parity GDP aggregates that include Bangladesh are based on calendar year data. For Belarus, projections were prepared before the presidential elections of August 9, 2020. The fiscal series for the Dominican Republic have the following coverage: public debt, debt service, and the cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the consolidated public sector (which includes central government, the rest of the nonfinancial public sector, and the central bank); and the remaining fiscal series are for the central government. The fiscal data for Ecuador reflect net lending/ borrowing for the nonfinancial public sector. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-136-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A LONG AND DIFFICULT ASCENT 118 International Monetary Fund|October 2020 Ecuadorian authorities, with technical support from the IMF, are undertaking revisions of the historical fiscal data for the net lending/borrowing of the nonfinancial public sector over 2012–17, with the view of correcting recently identified statistical errors in data compilation at the subnational level and the consistency between above-the-line and financing data by subsectors. India’s real GDP growth rates are calculated as per national accounts: for 1998 to 2011, with base year 2004/05 and, thereafter, with base year 2011/12. For Lebanon, projections for 2021–25 are omitted due to an unusually high degree of uncertainty. Against the backdrop of a civil war and weak capac- ity, the reliability of Libya’s data, especially regarding national accounts and medium-term projections, is low. Data for Syria are excluded from 2011 onward because of the uncertain political situation. Ukraine’s revised national accounts data are available beginning in 2000 and exclude Crimea and Sevastopol from 2010. Starting from October 2018 Uruguay’s public pen- sion system has been receiving transfers in the context of a new law that compensates persons affected by the creation of the mixed pension system. These funds are recorded as revenues, consistent with the IMF’s meth- odology. Therefore, data and projections for 2018–21 are affected by these transfers, which amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2018 and 1.2 percent of GDP in 2019, and are projected to be 0.8 percent of GDP in 2020, 0.2 percent of GDP in 2021, and zero percent thereafter. See IMF Country Report 19/64 for further details.4 The disclaimer about the public pension system applies only to the revenues and net lending/borrowing series. The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinan- cial public sector with the October 2019 WEO. In Uruguay, nonfinancial public sector coverage includes central government, local government, social security funds, nonfinancial public corporations, and Banco de Seguros del Estado. Historical data were also revised accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal perimeter— which excludes the central bank—assets and liabilities held by the nonfinancial public sector where the coun- terpart is the central bank are not netted out in debt 4 Uruguay: Staff Report for the 2018 Article IV Consultation, Coun- try Report 19/64 (Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund, February 2019). figures. In this context, capitalization bonds issued in the past by the government to the central bank are now part of the nonfinancial public sector debt. Gross and net debt estimates for 2008–11 are preliminary. Projecting the economic outlook in Venezuela, including assessing past and current economic devel- opments as the basis for the projections, is compli- cated by the lack of discussions with the authorities (the last Article IV consultation took place in 2004), incomplete understanding of the reported data, and difficulties in interpreting certain reported economic indicators given economic developments. The fiscal accounts include the budgetary central government; social security; FOGADE (insurance deposit institu- tion); and a sample of public enterprises, including Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA); and data for 2018–19 are IMF staff estimates. The effects of hyperinflation and the paucity of reported data mean that the IMF staff’s projected macroeconomic indica- tors need to be interpreted with caution. For example, nominal GDP is estimated assuming the GDP deflator rises in line with the IMF staff’s projection of average inflation. Public external debt in relation to GDP is projected using the IMF staff’s estimate of the average exchange rate for the year. Wide uncertainty surrounds these projections. Venezuela’s consumer prices are excluded from all WEO group composites. In 2019 Zimbabwe authorities introduced the Real Time Gross Settlement dollar, later renamed the ­Zimbabwe dollar, and are in the process of redenomi- nating their national accounts statistics. Current data are subject to revision. The Zimbabwe dollar previ- ously ceased circulating in 2009 and, between 2009 and 2019, Zimbabwe operated under a multi-currency regime with the US dollar as the unit of account. Classification of Countries Summary of the Country Classification The country classification in the WEO divides the world into two major groups: advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies.5 This classification is not based on strict criteria, economic or otherwise, and it has evolved over time. The objec- tive is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably 5 As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by interna- tional law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-137-2048.jpg) ![STATISTICAL APPENDIX International Monetary Fund|October 2020 119 meaningful method of organizing data. Table A pro- vides an overview of the country classification, showing the number of countries in each group by region and summarizing some key indicators of their relative size (GDP valued at purchasing power parity, total exports of goods and services, and population). Some countries remain outside the country classifi- cation and therefore are not included in the analysis. Cuba and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are examples of countries that are not IMF members, and the IMF therefore does not monitor their economies. General Features and Composition of Groups in the World Economic Outlook Classification Advanced Economies Table B lists the 39 advanced economies. The seven largest in terms of GDP based on market exchange rates—the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute the subgroup of major advanced economies, often referred to as the Group of Seven. The members of the euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup. Com- posite data shown in the tables for the euro area cover the current members for all years, even though the membership has increased over time. Table C lists the member countries of the European Union, not all of which are classified as advanced economies in the WEO. Emerging Market and Developing Economies The group of emerging market and developing econ- omies (156) includes all those that are not classified as advanced economies. The regional breakdowns of emerging market and developing economies are emerging and developing Asia; emerging and developing Europe (sometimes also referred to as “central and eastern Europe”); Latin America and the Caribbean; Middle East and Central Asia (which comprises the regional subgroups Caucasus and Central Asia; and Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan); and sub-Saharan Africa. Emerging market and developing economies are also classified according to analytical criteria that reflect the composition of export earnings and a distinc- tion between net creditor and net debtor economies. Tables D and E show the detailed composition of emerging market and developing economies in the regional and analytical groups. The analytical criterion source of export earnings distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products (SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized into one of these groups if their main source of export earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average between 2015 and 2019. The financial criteria focus on net creditor economies, net debtor economies, heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), and low-income developing countries (LIDCs). Economies are categorized as net debtors when their latest net international investment position, where available, was less than zero or their current account balance accumulations from 1972 (or earliest available data) to 2019 were negative. Net debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis of experience with debt servicing.6 The HIPC group comprises the countries that are or have been considered by the IMF and the World Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as the HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of time.7 Many of these countries have already benefited from debt relief and have graduated from the initiative. The LIDCs are countries that have per capita income levels below a certain threshold (set at $2,700 in 2016 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas method), structural features consistent with limited development and structural transformation, and external financial linkages insufficiently close for them to be widely seen as emerging market economies. 6 During 2015–19, 27 economies incurred external payments arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or rescheduling during 2015–19. 7 See David Andrews, Anthony R. Boote, Syed S. Rizavi, and Sukwinder Singh, “Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51 (Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund, November 1999). ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-138-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A LONG AND DIFFICULT ASCENT 120 International Monetary Fund|October 2020 Table A.

When no official budget has been announced, projections incorporate policy measures that are judged likely to be implemented. The medium- term fiscal projections are similarly based on a judg- ment about the most likely path of policies. For cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget intentions and prospects for policy implementation, an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions used in regard to some of the advanced economies follow. See also Tables B5 to B9 in the online section of the Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural balances.1 Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the avail- able information regarding budget outturn and budget plans for the federal and provincial governments, fiscal measures announced by the authorities, and the IMF staff’s macroeconomic projections. Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the fiscal year 2019/20 mid-year reviews of the Commonwealth and States, the Economic and Fiscal Outlook in July 2020, and the IMF staff’s estimates and projections. Austria: Fiscal projections are based on data from Statistics Austria, the authorities’ projections, and the IMF staff’s estimates and projections. Belgium: Projections are based on the 2020–21 Stability Programme (covering only two years due 1 The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a percentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is the actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output from potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors, such as asset and commodity prices and output composition effects. Changes in the structural balance consequently include effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical fluctuations in net lending/borrowing. The computations of structural balances are based on the IMF staff’s estimates of potential GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See Annex I of the October 1993 WEO.) Net debt is calculated as gross debt minus financial assets corresponding to debt instruments. Estimates of the output gap and of the structural balance are subject to significant margins of uncertainty. to the COVID-19 shock), the Draft Budgetary Plan 2020, and other available information on the authori- ties’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Brazil: Fiscal projections for 2020 reflect policy announcements as of July 31. Those for the medium term assume compliance with the constitutional spending ceiling. Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts in the 2019 federal budget, the Economic and Fiscal Snapshot 2020, and the latest provincial budget as available. The IMF staff makes some adjustments to these forecasts, including for differences in mac- roeconomic projections. The IMF staff’s forecast also incorporates the most recent data releases from Statistics Canada’s Canadian System of National Economic Accounts, including federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns through the first quarter of 2020. Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’ quar- terly fiscal reports, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s projections for GDP and copper prices. China: A large fiscal expansion is estimated for 2020 based on budgeted and announced tax and expen- diture measures in response to offset the health and economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2021 a mild expansion is projected given that the output gap is expected to remain relatively large. Denmark: Estimates for 2020 are aligned with the latest official budget numbers, adjusted where appro- priate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions. For 2021 the projections incorporate key features of the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the authorities’ latest budget. France: Estimates for 2019 and projections for 2020 onward are based on the measures of the 2018 budget law, the 2019 budget law, and the 2020 budget law, adjusted for differences in assumptions on macroeco- nomic and financial variables, and revenue projections. Historical fiscal data reflect the May 2019 revisions and update of the historical fiscal accounts, debt data, and national accounts. Germany: The IMF staff’s projections for 2020 and beyond are based on the 2020 Stability Program, supplementary budgets, and data updates from the national statistical agency and ministry of finance, adjusted for the differences in the IMF staff’s mac- roeconomic framework and assumptions concerning revenue elasticities. The estimate of gross debt includes Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Economies ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-155-2048.jpg) ![STATISTICAL APPENDIX International Monetary Fund|October 2020 137 portfolios of impaired assets and noncore business transferred to institutions that are winding up, as well as other financial sector and EU support operations. Greece: Historical data since 2010 reflect adjust- ments in line with the primary balance definition under the enhanced surveillance framework for Greece. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Projections are based on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections on expenditures. Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF staff’s projections of the macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy plans announced in the 2020 budget. India: Historical data are based on budgetary execu- tion data. Projections are based on available informa- tion on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Subnational data are incorporated with a lag of up to one year; general government data are thus finalized well after central government data. IMF and Indian presentations differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and license-auction proceeds, net versus gross recording of revenues in cer- tain minor categories, and some public sector lending. Indonesia: IMF projections are consistent with gradual unwinding of the large fiscal stimulus in 2020, including returning the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2023. Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the country’s Budget 2020 and Stability Programme Update 2020. Israel: Historical data are based on government finance statistics data prepared by the Central Bureau of Statistics. Projections assume the partial implemen- tation of the two fiscal packages provided by parlia- ment in response to the coronavirus shock. Italy: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections are informed by the fiscal plans included in the govern- ment’s 2020 budget and approved supplementary budgets. The stock of maturing postal saving bonds is included in the debt projections. Japan: Projections reflect the fiscal measures already announced by the government, as of September 11, with adjustments for IMF staff assumptions. Korea: The medium-term forecast incorporates the medium-term path for the overall fiscal balance in the 2021 budget and the medium-term fiscal plan announced in the 2021 budget, and IMF staff’s adjustment. Mexico: Fiscal projections for 2020 are informed by the approved budget but take into account the likely effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on fiscal outturns; projections for 2021 onward assume com- pliance with rules established in the Fiscal Respon- sibility Law. The projections reflect data available until August 31, 2020. Hence, they do not take into account the draft 2021 budget. Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2020–25 are based on IMF staff forecasts and informed by the authori- ties’ draft budget plan and Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis projections. Historical data were revised following the June 2014 Central Bureau of Statistics release of revised macro data because of the adoption of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and the revisions of data sources. New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the fiscal year 2020/21 budget and IMF staff estimates. Portugal: The projections for the current year are based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast. Projections thereafter are based on the assumption of unchanged policies. Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are based on the Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plans (FEGPs), which were prepared in October 2018, and are certified by the Oversight Board. In line with this plan’s assumptions, IMF projections assume federal aid for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in September 2017. The projections also assume revenue losses from the following: elimination of federal funding for the Affordable Care Act starting in 2020 for Puerto Rico; elimination of federal tax incentives starting in 2018 that had neutralized the effects of Puerto Rico’s Act 154 on foreign firms; and the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduce the tax advantage of US firms producing in Puerto Rico. Given sizable policy uncertainty, some FEGP and IMF assumptions may differ, in particular those relating to the effects of the corporate tax reform, tax compliance, and tax adjustments (fees and rates); reduction of subsidies and expenses, freezing of payroll operational costs, and improvement of mobility; reduc- tion of expenses; and increased health care efficiency. On the expenditure side, measures include extension of Act 66, which freezes much government spending, through 2020; reduction of operating costs; decreases in government subsidies; and spending cuts in educa- tion. Although IMF policy assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario with full measures, the IMF’s projections of fiscal revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from the FEGPs’. This stems from Box A1 (continued) ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-156-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A LONG AND DIFFICULT ASCENT 138 International Monetary Fund|October 2020 two main differences in methodologies: first, while IMF projections are on an accrual basis, the FEGPs’ are on a cash basis. Second, the IMF and FEGPs make very different macroeconomic assumptions. Russia: Fiscal policy will be countercyclical in 2020. It will show a degree of consolidation in 2021 and will return to the fiscal rule in 2022. Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff baseline fiscal pro- jections are based on IMF staff’s understanding of government policies as outlined in the 2020 Budget and government measures announced to counter the adverse impact of COVID-19 and the decline in oil prices. Exported oil revenues are based on WEO baseline oil prices and staff’s understanding of Saudi Arabia’s current oil export policy. Singapore: For fiscal year 2020 projections are based on the budget (February 18, 2020) and subsequent supplementary budgets (March 26, April 6, April 21, May 26). IMF staff assumes that support packages in fiscal year 2020 are only for one year; for the rest of the projection period, IMF staff assumes unchanged policies. South Africa: Fiscal assumptions are mostly based on the 2020 Budget Review. Nontax revenue excludes transactions in financial assets and liabilities as they involve primarily revenues associated with realized exchange rate valuation gains from the holding of foreign currency deposits, sale of assets, and conceptu- ally similar items. Spain: The 2020 fiscal projections include the discretionary measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the legislated pension and public wage increases, and the minimal vital income support. Fiscal projections from 2021 onward assume an expi- ration of the temporary COVID-19 measures and no further policy change. Disbursements under the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility are reflected in the projections for 2021–24. Sweden: Fiscal estimates for 2019 are based on the data from the Swedish Ministry of Finance. Projections for 2020 are based on preliminary information on the fall 2020 budget bill. The fiscal impact of cyclical devel- opments is calculated using the 2014 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s elasticity2 to take into account output and employment gaps. 2 See Robert Price, Thai-Thanh Dang, and Yvan Guillemette, “New Tax and Expenditure Elasticity Estimates for EU Budget Surveillance,” OECD Economics Department Working Papers 1174 (Paris: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, December 2019). Switzerland: The fiscal projections for 2020 reflect the authorities’ discretionary stimulus, which is per- mitted within the context of the debt brake rule in the event of “exceptional circumstances.” Turkey: The basis for the projections in the WEO and Fiscal Monitor is the IMF-defined fiscal balance, which excludes some revenue and expenditure items that are included in the authorities’ headline balance. United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on the UK’s Budget Statement 2020 and revised estimated by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Expenditure projections reflect the measures to respond to the outbreak of the coronavirus. Revenue projections are in addition adjusted for differences between the IMF staff’s forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth and inflation) and the forecasts of these variables assumed in the authorities’ fiscal projections. Projections assume that the measures taken in response to the coronavirus outbreak expire as announced, but also that there is some additional fiscal loosening relative to the policies announced to date over the next two years to support the economic recovery, and gradual consolidation begins thereafter with the goal of stabilizing public debt within five years. The IMF staff’s data exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012. Real govern- ment consumption and investment are part of the real GDP path, which, according to the IMF staff, may or may not be the same as projected by the UK Office for Budget Responsibility. Fiscal year GDP is different from current year GDP. The fiscal accounts are pre- sented in terms of fiscal year. Projections do not take into account revisions to the accounting (including on student loans) implemented on September 24, 2019. United States: Fiscal projections are based on the January 2020 Congressional Budget Office baseline, adjusted for the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. Projections incorporate the effects of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemen- tal Appropriations Act, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. Finally, fiscal projec- tions are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s forecasts for key macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support and of defined-benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis.

Due to data limitations, most series begin in 2001. Monetary Policy Assumptions Monetary policy assumptions are based on the established policy framework in each country. In most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance over the business cycle: official interest rates will increase when economic indicators suggest that inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range; they will decrease when indicators suggest inflation will not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that output growth is below its potential rate, and that the margin of slack in the economy is significant. On this basis, the London interbank offered rate on six-month US dollar deposits is assumed to average 0.7 percent in 2020 and 0.4 percent in 2021 (see Table 1.1). The rate on three-month euro deposits is assumed to average –0.4 percent in 2020 and –0.5 percent in 2021. The interest rate on six-month Japanese yen deposits is assumed to average 0.0 percent in 2020 and in 2021. Argentina: Monetary policy assumptions are consis- tent with a modest real appreciation this year and the need for monetary financing of the fiscal deficit and reabsorbing this liquidity. Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with market expectations. Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with gradual convergence of inflation toward the middle of the target range. Canada: Monetary policy assumptions are based on the IMF staff’s analysis. Chile: Monetary policy assumptions are based on GDP growth rate. China: Monetary policy is expected to be accommo- dative in 2020 and remain supportive in 2021 (but to a lower degree than in 2020). Denmark: Monetary policy is to maintain the peg to the euro. Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro area member countries are in line with market expectations. Greece: Interest rates are based on the WEO LIBOR with an assumption of a spread for Greece. Broad money projections are based on the monetary financial institution balance sheets and deposit flow assumptions. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The IMF staff assumes that the currency board system will remain intact. India: Monetary policy projections are consistent with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation target over the medium term. Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with the maintenance of inflation within the central bank’s targeted band. Israel: Assumptions include a moderately loose monetary stance in the short term and normalization of nonmonetary policy toward the medium term. Japan: Monetary policy assumptions are in line with market expectations. Korea: The projections assume that the policy rate evolves in line with market expectations. Mexico: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with attaining the inflation target. Netherlands: Monetary projections are based on IMF staff six-month euro LIBOR projections. New Zealand: Monetary projections are based on the growth of nominal GDP estimates. Portugal: Monetary projections are based on projections for the real and fiscal sectors. Russia: Monetary projections assume that the Central Bank of Russia is adopting a moderately accommodative monetary policy stance. Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are based on the continuation of the exchange rate peg to the US dollar. Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in line with the projected growth in nominal GDP. South Africa: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with maintaining inflation within the 3–6 percent target band. Sweden: Monetary projections are in line with Riksbank projections. Switzerland: The projections assume no change in the policy rate in 2020–21. Turkey: The outlook for monetary and financial conditions assumes no further monetary policy easing in 2020. United Kingdom: The short-term interest rate path is based on market interest rate expectations. United States: The IMF staff expects the Federal Open Market Committee to continue to adjust the federal funds target rate in line with the broader macroeconomic outlook.

Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’ national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance of payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus investment (I) is equal to the current account balance (CAB) (S - I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability. 1Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

They noted that the projections assume that social distancing will con- tinue into 2021 and then fade over time as therapies improve and vaccines become more broadly available. Directors noted with concern that the pandemic is having dramatic effects on vulnerable people, leading to higher inequality, and a sharp increase in the num- ber of people living in extreme poverty. Directors agreed that the uncertainty surrounding the baseline projections remains exceptionally large as the economic recovery will be shaped primarily by the path of the pandemic, the efficacy of contain- ment measures, and pharmaceutical innovations. More rapid development of new therapeutics and wide distribution of effective vaccines could acceler- ate the economic recovery, while medical setbacks and new waves of infections could require new lockdowns. Other important sources of uncertainty include the extent of global spillovers, the damage to the supply potential, the efficacy and duration of policy support, and potential shifts in financial market sentiment. Directors also noted prepandemic risks stemming from trade and technology tensions, geopolitical challenges, and climate change. Directors agreed that effective and decisive policy support is needed to ensure stronger, more equitable, and resilient growth. Key near-term priorities include supporting the economic recovery, protecting vulner- able people, and strengthening health care systems. They stressed the need to reduce the scarring effects of the crisis on potential output and employment and to reverse the development toward greater inequality and setbacks to human capital accumulation. Most Direc- tors also saw the crisis as an opportunity to stimulate innovation, develop the digital infrastructure, and to transition to lower carbon emissions using different climate tools, such as green investment and a gradual increase of the carbon price, with due consideration to offsetting negative social impact. Directors welcomed the unprecedented fiscal actions in response to the pandemic. Directors emphasized that, as economies tentatively reopen, governments should ensure that lifelines are not withdrawn prema- turely. Support should gradually shift from protect- ing jobs to helping displaced workers find new jobs through retraining and reskilling. Directors noted that when the pandemic is under control, governments will need to address the legacies of the crisis, including record deficits and public debt levels, elevated unem- ployment, and increased poverty. Directors agreed that public investment should play a crucial role in supporting the postpandemic recovery, noted its siz- able job creation potential, and underlined that good governance, budget execution, and communication, remain crucial to reap the full benefits of fiscal support and maintain public trust. Directors emphasized that governments will need to do more with less and prepare credible and equi- table measures to reduce fiscal deficits and debts over the medium term. Countries with limited fiscal space should protect public investment and support lower- income households that have been disproportionately hit by the pandemic. Governments could consider increasing progressive taxation as well as reforms to modernize business taxation, including multilateral cooperation on the design of international corporate taxation to respond to the challenges of the digital economy. LICs in particular are faced with significant financing constraints, and many countries will require external support, including in the form of debt relief, grants, and concessional financing. The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the Fiscal Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on September 30, 2020. IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK, OCTOBER 2020 ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-200-2048.jpg) ![WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A LONG AND DIFFICULT ASCENT 182 International Monetary Fund|October 2020 Directors agreed that bold policy actions taken by central banks to ease monetary policy, provide ample liquidity, and maintain the flow of credit have helped contain the near-term risks to global financial stabil- ity. They noted, however, that vulnerabilities are rising, most notably in the nonfinancial corporate sector as liquidity pressures may morph into insolvencies, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. The credit outlook will ultimately be shaped by the extent of continued policy support and the pace of the recovery, which is expected to be uneven across sectors and countries. Rising defaults could lead to significant losses at banks and nonbank financial institutions. While the global banking system is overall well capital- ized, some banks and banking systems may experi- ence aggregate capital shortfalls in the WEO adverse scenario. Directors also highlighted the importance of improving access of emerging markets and frontier economies to capital markets. Directors emphasized that as economies reopen, accommodative policies and the continued flow of credit to borrowers will be essential to sustaining the recovery. Once the pandemic is under control, policy support can be gradually withdrawn. The postpandemic financial reform agenda should focus on strengthening the regulatory framework to address vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector exposed by the crisis and stepping up prudential supervision to contain excessive risk taking in the lower-for-longer interest rate environment. Directors underscored the importance of inter- national cooperation in the fight against the global health and economic crisis. A key priority is to scale up production capacity and develop distribution channels to ensure that all countries have access to an effective, affordable, and safe vaccine. Directors noted that sev- eral emerging market and developing countries require international assistance through debt relief, grants, and concessional financing. They pointed out that the IMF has rapidly scaled up its lending facilities since the onset of the pandemic, providing swift financial assis- tance to more than 80 countries. Directors discussed opportunities for multilateral cooperation to alleviate trade and technology tensions between countries and to collectively implement climate change mitigation policies. ](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfworldeconomicoutlookoctober2020-201014163106/75/Imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020-201-2048.jpg) ![IMF Special Series on COVID-19 The IMF has responded to the COVID-19 crisis by quickly deploying financial assistance, developing policy advice, and creating special tools to assist member countries. The Special Notes Series (IMF.org/COVID19notes) features the latest analysis and research from IMF staff in response to the pandemic. Below are four recent Notes from the dozens published to date. Options to Support the Income of Informal Workers during COVID-19 Federico Díez, Romain Duval, Chiara Maggi,Yi Ji, Ippei Shibata, and Marina Medes Tavares This note reviews available options to support informal workers during COVID-19, as well as potential costs and selected financing options. A transfer to cover the basic food and energy needs of all informal workers for two months could cost over 2 and 5 percentage points of annual GDP in the median emerging market and low-income economies, respectively. The Disconnect Between Financial Markets and the Real Economy Deniz Igan, Divya Kirti, and Soledad Martinez Peria This note examines several prominent hypotheses to explain the disconnect between financial markets and the real economy in 2020. The note concludes that monetary policy actions—and the associated decline in discount rates—have lifted asset valuations. Emerging Market Capital Flows under COVID: What to Expect Given What We Know Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan This note summarizes recent empirical research that focuses on emerging market capital flows before and during the COVID-19 shock, examining the complex interaction between domestic fiscal and external financing needs in those economies. COVID-19 and Government Debt Dynamics in Low-Income Developing Countries Gabriela Cugat, Giovanni Melina, and Felipe Zanna This note assesses the potential medium-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gov- ernment debt in developing countries. The estimates are based on calibrations of a struc- tural model. Absent more multilateral support, restructurings, and/or fiscal consolidations, government debt may increase significantly in many developing economies.

It provides an overview of the global economic outlook and discusses policies to support recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The report finds that the global economy is climbing out of a severe recession due to the pandemic but faces a long recovery that is prone to setbacks. It projects a partial recovery in 2021 but warns that long-term economic damage has been done. It emphasizes the need for continued health and economic support policies and enhanced international cooperation.

It finds that the global economic recovery remains too slow and uneven. Growth is projected to increase modestly in 2016-17 for both advanced and emerging market economies. Downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased due to concerns around China's economic rebalancing, lower commodity prices, and uneven economic recovery among advanced economies. The report examines factors driving the recent slowdown in capital flows to emerging markets and assesses the macroeconomic impact of structural reforms in advanced economies.

The number of commodity-dependent countries has increased over the past 20 years, mainly due to a rise in mineral-dependent countries, while the dominant export product group changed in only 25% of countries. Changes in commodity prices partly explain the evolution of commodity dependence by product group, with dependence on agricultural exports declining as prices fell.

It summarizes that while the global economic recovery remains fragile, developing countries are leading the recovery due to strong countercyclical policies. However, developed countries' recoveries are uneven, with the US recovering domestic demand faster than Germany and Japan which rely more on exports. The recovery in Europe remains weak, and a shift toward fiscal austerity there could risk a double-dip recession. Coordinated global efforts are still needed to rebalance demand and prevent a resurgence of imbalances.

Among G-20 countries, fiscal deficits are projected to increase by 5.5% of GDP in both 2009 and 2010 due to discretionary stimulus measures, automatic stabilizers, and falling revenues. Tax cuts have been implemented more quickly than spending measures. While a comprehensive assessment is difficult due to limited reporting, signs indicate the pace of stimulus spending has accelerated recently in some countries like the US. Overall, fiscal expansion has helped counter the economic downturn but medium-term fiscal strategies are still lacking in many countries.

In the second half of this year, GDP growth in the EU is set to be very modest, while in the euro area it will almost stagnate. Among the largest euro area Member States, we see growth increasing in Spain where unemployment remains very high, growth coming to a stop in Germany after a very strong first quarter, protracted stagnation in France, and contraction in Italy. Financial markets have adjusted sharply in recent weeks as the prospect of more modest growth, not just in Europe but globally, has ended a period of yield hunting and risk compression.

It contains 4 multiple choice questions and short answer questions about topics such as GDP, inflation, investment, and unemployment. Some key details extracted from the summary are: GDP per capita in the UK fell by around 5% between 2008 and 2011 according to the table provided. An increase in the rate of VAT would cause the equilibrium level of real national output to fall and the average price level to rise. Business confidence was lowest in the last quarter of 2011 based on the chart shown. The total addition to an economy’s capital stock taking into account the level of depreciation of capital is the definition of net investment.

Growth is expected to be supported by low oil prices, low interest rates, and a slightly expansionary fiscal stance. However, the boost from cheaper oil and the lagged effects of the weaker euro will fade. As a result, private consumption growth is expected to slow somewhat. Risks to the outlook remain high, mainly on the downside, including political uncertainty in Europe and globally. Economic policy needs to support growth while also standing ready to react to potential downside risks.

While GDP growth is expected to continue, public finances remain sound and unemployment is low. However, population aging poses risks to long-term fiscal sustainability. Key challenges include boosting productivity growth through investment in skills, innovation, housing and transport infrastructure. Additional efforts are also needed to increase labor force participation among older workers and address rising inequality. Overall, Luxembourg has made limited progress in addressing previous country-specific recommendations. [Macroeconomic Developments Report.

To sustain growth and avoid the \"middle income trap\", the document recommends that Cambodia focus on increasing skills training to diversify the economy, strengthening the financial sector to support SMEs, and leveraging opportunities from regional economic integration under ASEAN.

Among G-20 countries, fiscal deficits are projected to increase by 5.5% of GDP in both 2009 and 2010 due to discretionary stimulus measures, automatic stabilizers, and falling revenues. Tax cuts have been implemented more quickly than spending measures. While a comprehensive assessment is difficult due to limited reporting, signs indicate the pace of stimulus spending has accelerated recently in some countries like the US. Overall, fiscal expansion has helped counter the economic downturn but medium-term fiscal strategies are still lacking in many countries.

In the second half of this year, GDP growth in the EU is set to be very modest, while in the euro area it will almost stagnate. Among the largest euro area Member States, we see growth increasing in Spain where unemployment remains very high, growth coming to a stop in Germany after a very strong first quarter, protracted stagnation in France, and contraction in Italy. Financial markets have adjusted sharply in recent weeks as the prospect of more modest growth, not just in Europe but globally, has ended a period of yield hunting and risk compression.

Growth is expected to be supported by low oil prices, low interest rates, and a slightly expansionary fiscal stance. However, the boost from cheaper oil and the lagged effects of the weaker euro will fade. As a result, private consumption growth is expected to slow somewhat. Risks to the outlook remain high, mainly on the downside, including political uncertainty in Europe and globally. Economic policy needs to support growth while also standing ready to react to potential downside risks.

While GDP growth is expected to continue, public finances remain sound and unemployment is low. However, population aging poses risks to long-term fiscal sustainability. Key challenges include boosting productivity growth through investment in skills, innovation, housing and transport infrastructure. Additional efforts are also needed to increase labor force participation among older workers and address rising inequality. Overall, Luxembourg has made limited progress in addressing previous country-specific recommendations. [Macroeconomic Developments Report.

[Solina Yean](https://www.slideshare.net/solinayean) The document summarizes Cambodia's economic outlook for 2013. It finds that while Cambodia has experienced strong economic growth in recent years, reaching an estimated 7.7% GDP growth in 2012, this growth has not been inclusive and has lagged in improving social indicators like education and healthcare. To sustain growth and avoid the \"middle income trap\", the document recommends that Cambodia focus on increasing skills training to diversify the economy, strengthening the financial sector to support SMEs, and leveraging opportunities from regional economic integration under ASEAN.

It analyzes the latest public finance developments, updates medium-term fiscal projections, and assesses policies to put public finances on a sustainable footing. The key findings are that fiscal trends have worsened in recent years across many countries. Advanced economies face growing divergences in fiscal policy, emerging markets will need tough policy adjustments, and low-income developing countries are riding out a turning tide. Fiscal risks are also on the rise globally. The publication calls for countries to respond to these new realities through prudent fiscal policies and risk management.

It discusses adjustments to lower commodity prices in three key areas: 1) Recent global economic developments and prospects, risks to the outlook, and necessary policy responses. Growth is projected to slow across commodity exporters due to lower prices. 2) The impact of commodity price cycles on output for exporting countries, using models and historical data from the past five decades. Commodity booms tend to boost growth but recessions often follow. 3) Whether exchange rates and trade remain connected, given trends like global value chains.

It finds that the global economic recovery remains too slow and warns of increased downside risks. The outlook projects continued moderate global growth of 3.2% in 2016 and 3.5% in 2017, below historical averages. Advanced economies are expected to see lackluster growth while emerging markets face difficulties like weak commodity prices and capital outflows. The report examines topics like the slowdown in global trade and capital flows to emerging markets. It also analyzes the macroeconomic effects of labor and product market reforms in advanced economies.

As a result of the pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by –3 percent in 2020, much worse than during the 2008–09 financial crisis. In a baseline scenario--which assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and containment efforts can be gradually unwound—the global economy is projected to grow by 5.8 percent in 2021 as economic activity normalizes, helped by policy support. The risks for even more severe outcomes, however, are substantial. Effective policies are essential to forestall the possibility of worse outcomes, and the necessary measures to reduce contagion and protect lives are an important investment in long-term human and economic health. Because the economic fallout is acute in specific sectors, policymakers will need to implement substantial targeted fiscal, monetary, and financial market measures to support affected households and businesses domestically. And internationally, strong multilateral cooperation is essential to overcome the effects of the pandemic, including to help financially constrained countries facing twin health and funding shocks, and for channeling aid to countries with weak health care systems.

The report identifies suppliers in Russia, China, Singapore, India, and Thailand that have transferred weapons, manufacturing equipment, and materials despite international condemnation of the military's human rights abuses. It concludes that sanctions are failing to curb arms flows because they are not well coordinated or enforced, allowing arms dealers to circumvent them. The Special Rapporteur recommends fully enforcing arms embargoes and targeting the military's sources of revenue to protect human rights in Myanmar.

The proliferation of large datasets has been pivotal in enabling models to learn intricate patterns and relationships, thereby significantly enhancing their performance \\[4\\]. Concurrently, advancements in hardware acceleration technologies, notably Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) \\[5\\] have markedly reduced model training times by facilitating rapid computations and parallel processing capabilities. These advancements have substantially accelerated the training process.2 Moreover, enhancements in algorithmic techniques for optimization and training have further augmented the speed and efficiency of deep learning models, leading to quicker convergence and superior generalization capabilities \\[4\\]. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of applications, including computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition. These applications underscore the transformative impact of DL in various domains, where it continues to set new performance benchmarks \\[6, 7\\]. Deep learning models draw inspiration from the structure and functionality of the human nervous system and brain. These models employ input, hidden, and output layers to organize processing units. Within each layer, the nodes or units are interconnected with those in the layer below, and each connection is assigned to a weight value. The units sum the inputs after multiplying them by their corresponding weights \\[8\\]. Fig. 1 illustrates the relationship between AI, ML, and DL, highlighting that machine learning and deep learning are subfields of artificial intelligence. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive overview of various deep learning models and compare their performance across different applications. In Section 2, we introduce a fundamental definition of deep learning. Section 3 covers supervised deep learning models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). Section 4 reviews generative models such as Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). Section 5 presents a comprehensive survey of Transformer architecture. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is discussed in Section 6, while Section 7 addresses Deep Transfer Learning (DTL). The principles of hybrid deep learning are explored in Section 8, followed by a discussion of deep learning applications in Section 9. Section 10 surveys the challenges in deep learning and potential alternative solutions. In Section 11, we conduct experiments and analyze the performance of different deep learning models using th [Моніторинг ІТ сектору України GET\\_UKR\\_PB\\_03\\_2025.pdf](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/get_ukr_pb_03_2025-pdf/278905533) ![Моніторинг ІТ сектору України GET_UKR_PB_03_2025.pdf](https://cdn.slidesharecdn.com/ss_thumbnails/getukrpb032025-250509104056-fe03662a-thumbnail.jpg?width=560&fit=bounds)![Моніторинг ІТ сектору України GET_UKR_PB_03_2025.pdf](https://cdn.slidesharecdn.com/ss_thumbnails/getukrpb032025-250509104056-fe03662a-thumbnail.jpg?width=560&fit=bounds) Моніторинг ІТ сектору України GET\\_UKR\\_PB\\_03\\_2025.pdf [Інститут економічних досліджень та політичних консультацій](https://www.slideshare.net/IER_Kyiv) Огляд IT-сектору України за 2024 рік.

[WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK:](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#9) TK viii International Monetary Fund\\|October 2020 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TENSIONS FROM THE TWO-SPEED RECOVERY ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook (WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July 24 to August 21, 2020, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $41.69 a barrel in 2020 and $46.70 a barrel in 2021 and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on US dollar deposits will average 0.7 percent in 2020 and 0.4 percent in 2021; that the three-month euro deposit rate will average –0.4 percent in 2020 and –0.5 percent in 2021; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield, on average, 0.0 percent in 2020 and 2021. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through September 28, 2020. The following conventions are used throughout the WEO: . . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable; – between years or months (for example, 2019–20 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months; and / between years or months (for example, 2019/20) to indicate a fiscal or financial year. “Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion. “Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of 1 percentage point). Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and government finance data for each country. For some countries, the figures for 2019 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments indicators for each country. What is new in this publication: • Following the recent release of the 2017 International Comparison Program (ICP) survey for new purchasing- power-parity benchmarks, the WEO’s estimates of purchasing-power-parity weights and GDP valued at purchasing power parity have been updated. For more details, see Box 1.1 in the October 2020 WEO at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2020/02/index.htm. • Starting with the October 2020 WEO, data and forecasts for Bangladesh and Tonga are presented on a fiscal year basis. • Data for West Bank and Gaza are now included in the WEO. West Bank and Gaza is added to the Middle East and Central Asia regional group. In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply: • If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database. • When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size. • Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding. 10\\. [Assumptions and Conventions](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#10) International Monetary Fund\\|October 2020 ix As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis. Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or region. Unless noted otherwise, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of the weighted group data. The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on the maps do not imply, on the part of the IMF, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries. 11\\.

[International Monetary Fund\\|October](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#12) 2020 xi This version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary. imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger com- pilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages. The data appearing in the WEO are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The histori- cal data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each country.

[WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK:](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#13) TK xii International Monetary Fund\\|October 2020 WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TENSIONS FROM THE TWO-SPEED RECOVERY PREFACE The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department— together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and the Fiscal Affairs Department. The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Gita Gopinath, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Gian Maria Milesi-­Ferretti, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Malhar Nabar, Division Chief, Research Department; Oya Celasun, Division Chief, Research Department directed Chapter 3.

[International Monetary Fund\\|October](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#14) 2020 xiii M ore than one million lives have been lost to COVID-19 since the start of the year and the toll continues to rise. Many more have suffered serious illness. Close to 90 million people are expected to fall into extreme deprivation this year. These are difficult times, yet there are some reasons to be hopeful. Testing has been ramped up, treatments are improving, and vaccine trials have proceeded at an unprecedented pace, with some now in the final stage of testing. International solidarity has strength- ened along some dimensions, from rolling back trade restrictions on medical equipment to enhancing finan- cial assistance for vulnerable countries. And recent data suggest that many economies have started to recover at a faster pace than anticipated after reopen- ing from the Great Lockdown. We are projecting a somewhat less severe though still deep recession in 2020, relative to our June fore- cast. The revision is driven by second quarter GDP outturns in large advanced economies, which were not as negative as we had projected; China’s return to growth, which was stronger than expected; and signs of a more rapid recovery in the third quarter. Outturns would have been much weaker if it weren’t for sizable, swift, and unprecedented fiscal, monetary, and regulatory responses that maintained dispos- able income for households, protected cash flow for firms, and supported credit provision. Collectively these actions have so far prevented a recurrence of the financial catastrophe of 2008-09. While the global economy is coming back, the ascent will likely be long, uneven, and uncertain. Indeed, compared to our forecast in June, prospects have worsened significantly in some emerging market and developing economies where infections are rising rapidly. Consequently, emerging market and devel- oping economies, excluding China, are projected to incur a greater loss of output over 2020-21 relative to the pre-pandemic projected path when compared to advanced economies. These uneven recoveries signifi- cantly worsen the prospects for global convergence in income levels. Moreover, recovery is not assured while the pan- demic continues to spread. With renewed upticks in COVID-19 infections in places that had reduced local transmission to low levels, re-openings have paused, and targeted shutdowns are being reinstated. Economies everywhere face difficult paths back to pre- pandemic activity levels. Preventing further setbacks will require that policy support is not prematurely withdrawn. The path ahead will require skillful domestic policies that man- age trade-offs between lifting near-term activity and addressing medium-term challenges. The October 2020 Global Financial Stability Report highlights such trade-offs for monetary policy. Sustaining the recov- ery will also require strong international cooperation on health and financial support for countries facing liquidity shortfalls. Finding the right policy mix is daunting, but the experience of the past few months provides grounds for cautious optimism that the pri- orities laid out in this report can be achieved. A key aspect of combating the health crisis is to ensure that all innovations, be they in testing, treat- ments, or vaccines, are produced at scale for the benefit of all countries. Advance purchase commit- ments for vaccines under trial can help spur this process for manufacturers who may otherwise hesitate to bear the upfront cost. This effort should include a strong multilateral component to help distribute doses to all countries at affordable prices. More generally, the global community will need to continue helping countries with limited health care capacity through sharing equipment, know-how, and through financial support from international health agencies. At the national level, governments have already responded with a variety of fiscal countermeasures that include efforts to cushion income losses, incentivize hiring, expand social assistance, guarantee credit, and inject equity into firms. These measures have pre- vented widespread firm bankruptcies and have helped employment rebound partially. Employment and labor force participation, however, remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and many more millions of jobs are at risk the longer this crisis continues. To preserve FOREWORD 15\\. [jobs, it is](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#15) important for governments, where possible, to continue to support viable but still vulnerable firms with moratoria on debt service and equity-like support. Over time, once the recovery has taken a strong hold, policies should shift gradually to facili- tating reallocation of workers from sectors likely to shrink on a long-term basis (travel) to growing sectors (e-commerce). Along the transition, workers will need to be supported, including through income transfers, retraining, and reskilling programs. Advanced economies have generally been able to deliver larger direct spending and liquidity support rela- tive to GDP than others constrained by elevated debt and higher borrowing costs. Those constrained coun- tries will need to create room for immediate spend- ing needs by prioritizing crisis countermeasures and reducing poorly targeted subsidies. Some will require additional help from creditors and donors through debt restructuring, grants, and concessional financing, building on important initiatives under way. The IMF has been central to these initiatives through its joint call with the World Bank on debt service suspension for low-income countries, its call for reform of the interna- tional debt architecture, and its extension of funding at unprecedented speed to several member countries. Further complicating the task that countries face is the need to address challenges coming out of the pandemic. In this report we are releasing medium- term growth projections for the first time since the crisis started. While uncertainty remains substantial, growth is expected to moderate significantly, follow- ing the projected rebound in global activity in 2021. Both advanced and emerging market economies are likely to register significant losses of output relative to their pre-pandemic forecasts. Small states as well as tourism-dependent and commodities-based economies are in a particularly difficult spot. Most economies will experience lasting damage to supply potential, reflecting scars from the deep recession this year and the need for structural change. The persistent output losses imply a major setback to living standards relative to what was expected before the pandemic. Not only will the incidence of extreme poverty rise for the first time in over two decades, but inequality is set to increase because the crisis has disproportionately affected women, the informally employed, and those with relatively lower educational attainment, as discussed in Chapter 2 of this report. The loss of human capital accumulation after wide- spread school closures poses an additional challenge. Moreover, sovereign debt levels are set to increase significantly even as downgrades to potential output imply a smaller tax base that makes it harder to ser- vice the debt. On the plus side, the prospects of low interest rates over a longer period, alongside the pro- jected rebound in growth in 2021, can help alleviate debt service burdens in many countries. To ensure that debt remains on a sustainable path over the medium-term governments may need to increase the progressivity of their taxes and ensure that corpora- tions pay their fair share of taxes while eliminating wasteful spending. Near-term support policies should be designed with a view toward placing economies on paths of stronger, equitable, and sustainable growth. As discussed in Chapter 3 of this report, policymakers can simultaneously aim to mitigate climate change and bolster the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. This can be achieved through a comprehensive pack- age that includes a sizable green public infrastructure push, a gradual rise in carbon prices, and compen- sation for lower income households to make the transition fair. More generally, expanding the safety net where gaps exist can ensure the most vulnerable are protected while supporting near-term activity, as already seen, for example, in many advanced econo- mies where disposable income remained relatively stable even as GDP registered record collapses. And investments in health and education (including to remedy losses incurred during the pandemic) can help achieve participatory and inclusive growth. The October 2020 Fiscal Monitor makes a strong case for public investment in these times of heightened uncertainty. We have already had significant policy innova- tions in the past few months: the establishment of the European Union pandemic recovery package fund, the launch of asset purchases by emerging market central banks, and the novel use of digital technologies to deliver social assistance in places like sub-Saharan Africa. Such actions have prevented even more extreme collapses and are a powerful reminder that effective, well-designed policies protect people and collective economic well-being. Building on these actions, policies for the next stage of the crisis must seek lasting improvements in the global economy that create secure, prosperous futures for all.

[International Monetary Fund\\|October](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#16) 2020 xv The global economy is climbing out from the depths to which it had plummeted during the Great Lockdown in April. But with the COVID-19 pan- demic continuing to spread, many countries have slowed reopening and some are reinstating partial lockdowns to protect susceptible populations. While recovery in China has been faster than expected, the global economy’s long ascent back to pre-pandemic levels of activity remains prone to setbacks. Global Growth Outlook and Risks Near-term outlook. Global growth is projected at −4.4 percent in 2020, a less severe contraction than forecast in the June 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update. The revision reflects better-­than- anticipated second quarter GDP outturns, mostly in advanced economies, where activity began to improve sooner than expected after lockdowns were scaled back in May and June, as well as indicators of a stronger recovery in the third quarter. Global growth is pro- jected at 5.2 percent in 2021, a little lower than in the June 2020 WEO Update, reflecting the more moder- ate downturn projected for 2020 and consistent with expectations of persistent social distancing. Following the contraction in 2020 and recovery in 2021, the level of global GDP in 2021 is expected to be a mod- est 0.6 percent above that of 2019. The growth pro- jections imply wide negative output gaps and elevated unemployment rates this year and in 2021 across both advanced and emerging market economies. Medium-term outlook. After the rebound in 2021, global growth is expected to gradually slow to about 3.5 percent into the medium term. This implies only limited progress toward catching up to the path of economic activity for 2020–25 projected before the pandemic for both advanced and emerging market and developing economies. It is also a severe setback to the projected improvement in average living standards across all country groups. The pandemic will reverse the progress made since the 1990s in reducing global poverty and will increase inequality. People who rely on daily wage labor and are outside the formal safety net faced sudden income losses when mobility restrictions were imposed. Among them, migrant workers who live far from home had even less recourse to traditional support networks. Close to 90 million people could fall below the $1.90 a day income threshold of extreme deprivation this year. In addition, school closures dur- ing the pandemic pose a significant new challenge that could set back human capital accumulation severely. The subdued outlook for medium-term growth comes with a significant projected increase in the stock of sovereign debt. Downward revisions to potential output also imply a smaller tax base over the medium term than previously envisaged, compound- ing difficulties in servicing debt obligations. The baseline projection assumes that social distancing will continue into 2021 but will subsequently fade over time as vaccine coverage expands and therapies improve. Local transmission is assumed to be brought to low lev- els everywhere by the end of 2022. The medium-term projections also assume that economies will experi- ence scarring from the depth of the recession and the need for structural change, entailing persistent effects on potential output. These effects include adjustment costs and productivity impacts for surviving firms as they upgrade workplace safety, the amplification of the shock via firm bankruptcies, costly resource reallocation across sectors, and discouraged workers’ exit from the workforce. The scarring is expected to compound forces that dragged productivity growth lower across many economies in the years leading up to the pandemic— relatively slow investment growth weighing on physical capital accumulation, more modest improvements in human capital, and slower efficiency gains in combining technology with factors of production. Risks. The uncertainty surrounding the baseline projection is unusually large. The forecast rests on public health and economic factors that are inherently difficult to predict. A first layer relates to the path of the pandemic, the needed public health response, and the associated domestic activity disruptions, most notably for contact-intensive sectors. Another source of uncertainty is the extent of global spillovers from soft demand, weaker tourism, and lower remittances. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 17\\. [A third set](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#17) of factors comprises financial market senti- ment and its implications for global capital flows. Moreover, there is uncertainty surrounding the damage to supply potential—which will depend on the per- sistence of the pandemic shock, the size and effective- ness of the policy response, and the extent of sectoral resource mismatches. Progress with vaccines and treatments, as well as changes in the workplace and by consumers to reduce transmission, may allow activity to return more rap- idly to pre-pandemic levels than currently projected, without triggering repeated waves of infection. And an extension of fiscal countermeasures into 2021 could also lift growth above the forecast, which factors in only the measures implemented and announced so far. However, the risk of worse growth outcomes than projected remains sizable. If the virus resurges, progress on treatments and vaccines is slower than anticipated, or countries’ access to them remains unequal, eco- nomic activity could be lower than expected, with renewed social distancing and tighter lockdowns. Con- sidering the severity of the recession and the possible withdrawal of emergency support in some countries, rising bankruptcies could compound job and income losses. Deteriorating financial sentiment could trigger a sudden stop in new lending (or failure to roll over existing debt) to vulnerable economies. And cross-­ border spillovers from weaker external demand could amplify the impact of country-specific shocks. Policy Priorities: Near-Term Imperatives, Medium-Term Challenges Besides combating the deep near-term recession, policymakers have to address complex challenges to place economies on a path of higher productivity growth while ensuring that gains are shared evenly and debt remains sustainable. Many countries already face difficult trade-offs between implementing measures to support near-term growth and avoiding a further buildup of debt that will be hard to service down the road, considering the crisis’s hit to potential output. Policies to support the economy in the near term should therefore be designed with an eye to guiding economies to paths of stronger, equitable, and resilient growth. Tax and spending measures should privilege initiatives that can help lift potential output, ensure participatory growth that benefits all, and protect the vulnerable. The additional debt incurred to finance such endeavors is more likely to pay for itself down the road by increasing the size of the economy and future tax base than if the borrowing were done to finance ill-targeted subsidies or wasteful current spending. Investments in health, education, and high-return infrastructure projects that also help move the economy to lower carbon depen- dence can further those objectives. Research spending can facilitate innovation and technology adoption—the principal drivers of long-term productivity growth. Moreover, safeguarding critical social spending can ensure that the most vulnerable are protected while also supporting near-term activity, given that the outlays will go to groups with a higher propensity to spend their disposable income than more affluent individuals. In all instances, adhering to the highest standards of debt transparency will be essential to avoid future rollover difficulties and higher sovereign risk premiums that raise borrowing costs across the economy. Given the global nature of the shock and common challenges across countries, strong multilateral efforts are needed to fight the health and economic crisis. A key priority is funding advance purchase commitments at the global level for vaccines currently under trial to incentivize rapid scaling up of production and world- wide distribution of affordable doses (for example, by bolstering multilateral initiatives for vaccine develop- ment and manufacture, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance). This is particularly important given the uncertainty and risk of failure in the search for effective and safe vaccines. A related priority is to help countries with limited health care capacity. Beyond assistance with medical equipment and know-how, several emerging market and developing economies—in particular low-income countries—require support from the international community through debt relief, grants, and concessional financing. Where debt restructuring is needed, creditors and low-income-coun- try and emerging market borrowers should quickly agree on mutually acceptable terms. The global financial safety net can further help countries deal with external fund- ing shortfalls. Since the onset of the crisis, the IMF has expeditiously provided funding from its various lending facilities to about 80 countries at unprecedented speed. For many countries, sustaining economic activity and helping individuals and firms most in need—while ensuring that debt remains sustainable—is a daunt- ing task, given high public debt, the spending needs triggered by the crisis, and the hit to public revenues. Governments should do all that they can to combat the health crisis and mitigate the deep downturn while WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A LONG AND DIFFICULT ASCENT xvi International Monetary Fund\\|October 2020 18\\. [being ready to](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/imf-world-economic-outlook-october-2020/238876116#18) adjust policy strategy as the pandemic and its impact on activity evolve. Where fiscal rules may constrain action, their temporary suspension would be warranted, combined with a commit- ment to a gradual consolidation path after the crisis abates to restore compliance with the rules over the medium term. Room for immediate spending needs could be created by prioritizing crisis countermeasures and reducing wasteful and poorly targeted subsidies. Extending maturities on public debt and locking in low interest rates to the extent possible would help reduce debt service and free up resources to be redirected toward crisis mitigation efforts. Although adopting new revenue measures during the crisis will be difficult, governments may need to consider raising progressive taxes on more affluent individuals and those relatively less affected by the crisis (including increasing tax rates on higher income brackets, high-end property, capital gains, and wealth) as well as changes to corporate taxa- tion that ensure firms pay taxes commensurate with profitability. Countries should also cooperate on the design of international corporate taxation to respond to the challenges of the digital economy. With the pandemic continuing to spread, all countries—­including those where infections appear to have peaked—need to ensure that their health care systems can cope with elevated demand. This means securing adequate resources and prioritizing health care spending as needed, including on testing; contact tracing; personal protective equipment; life-­saving equipment, such as ventilators; and facilities, such as emergency rooms, intensive care units, and isolation wards. Countries where infections continue to rise need to contain the pandemic with mitigation measures that slow transmission. As Chapter 2 shows, lock- downs are effective in bringing down infections. Mitigation measures—a much-needed investment in public health—set the stage for an eventual economic recovery from the downturn brought on by mobility constraints. Economic policy in such cases should limit the damage by cushioning income losses for affected people and firms while also supporting resource real- location away from contact-intensive sectors that are likely to be constrained for an extended period of time. Retraining and reskilling should be pursued to the extent feasible so that workers can look for jobs in other sectors. Because the transition may take a while, displaced workers will need extended income support as they retrain and search for jobs. Complementing such measures, broad-based accommodative monetary and fiscal responses—where fiscal space exists—can help prevent deeper and longer-­lasting downturns, even if their ability to stimulate spending is initially hampered by mobility restrictions. As countries reopen, policies must support the recovery by gradually removing targeted support, facilitating the reallocation of workers and resources to sectors less affected by social distancing, and providing stimulus where needed to the extent possible. Some fiscal resources freed from targeted support should be redeployed to public investment—including in renewable energy, improving the efficiency of power transmission, and retrofitting buildings to reduce their carbon footprint. Moreover, as lifelines are unwound, social spending should be expanded to protect the most vulnerable where gaps exist in the safety net. In those cases, authorities could enhance paid family and sick leave, expand eligibility for unemployment insurance, and strengthen health care benefit coverage as needed. Where inflation expectations are anchored, accommodative monetary policy can help during the transition by containing borrowing costs. Beyond the pandemic, multilateral cooperation is needed to defuse trade and technology tensions between countries and address gaps—for instance in services trade—in the rules-based multilateral trading system. Countries must also act collectively to implement their climate change mitigation commitments. As discussed in Chapter 3, joint action—particularly by the largest emit- ters—that combines steadily rising carbon prices with a green investment push is needed to reduce emissions consistent with limiting increases in global temperature to the targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement. A broadly adopted, growth-friendly mitigation package could raise global activity through investment in green infrastructure over the near term, with modest output costs over the medium term as economies transition away from fossil fuels toward cleaner technologies. Relative to unchanged policies, such a package would significantly boost incomes in the second half of the century by avoiding damages and catastrophic risks from climate change. Moreover, health outcomes would begin to improve immediately in many countries thanks to reduced local air pollution. The global community should also take urgent steps to strengthen its defenses against calamitous health crises, for example by augmenting stockpiles of protective equipment and essential medical supplies, financing research, and ensuring adequate ongoing assistance to countries with limited health care capacity, including through support of international organizations.

During May and June, as many economies tentatively reopened from the Great Lockdown, the global economy started to climb from the depths to which it had plunged in April. But with the pandemic spreading and accelerating in places, many countries slowed reopening, and some are reinstating partial lockdowns. While the swift recov- ery in China has surprised on the upside, the global economy’s long ascent back to pre-pandemic levels of activity remains prone to setbacks. •• Activity picked up in May and June as economies reopened. The strengthening from the trough in April was most evident, not surprisingly, in retail sales, where discretionary consumer spending rose with reopening (Figure 1.1). Firms, however, remained cautious in responding to this revival: industrial production in many countries is still well below December levels. •• Second quarter GDP outturns, on balance, deliv- ered positive surprises. As economies reopened and released constraints on spending, overall activity normalized faster than anticipated in the June 2020 WEO Update. GDP outturns for the second quarter surprised on the upside in China (where, after lockdowns eased in early April, public investment helped boost activity to return to positive growth in the second quarter) and the United States and euro area (where both economies contracted at a historic pace in the second quarter, but less severely than projected, with government transfers support- ing household incomes). The news, however, was not uniformly positive. Second quarter GDP was weaker than projected, for instance, where domestic demand plunged following a very sharp compres- sion in consumption and a collapse in investment (such as in India), where the pandemic continued to spread (such as in Mexico), where soft external demand weighed particularly heavily on exporting sectors (for example, in Korea), and where signif- icant weakening of remittance flows weighed on domestic spending (for example, in the Philippines). •• Global trade began recovering in June as lockdowns were eased (Figure 1.2). China is an important contributor. Its exports recovered from deep declines earlier in the year, supported by an earlier restart of activity and a strong pickup in external demand for medical equipment and for equipment to support the shift to remote working. •• The pandemic continues to spread. By late September, the number of confirmed infections worldwide exceeded 33 million, with over a million deaths— up from more than 7 million infections and 400,000 deaths at the time of the June 2020 WEO Update. Confirmed cases rose dramatically in the United States, Latin America, India, and South Africa. Moreover, there were renewed upticks in places that had previously flattened the infection curve: Australia, Japan, Spain, and France. •• Reopening has stalled. Confronting renewed upticks, countries slowed their reopening during August and reinstated partial lockdowns in some cases (Figure 1.3). The deep wounds to the global economy from the pandemic recession are further evident in labor market indicators and inflation outcomes. •• Labor market. According to the International Labour Organization, the global reduction in work hours in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 was equivalent to the loss of 400 million full-time jobs, deepening from equiv- alent 155 million full-time jobs lost in the first quarter. Women in the labor force, particularly those informally employed, have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and lockdowns needed to slow the spread of the virus: the International Labour Organization estimates that 42 percent of informally employed women work in severely affected sectors of the economy, compared with about 32 percent of men in informal employment. Consistent with the pattern for global activity GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES1 CHAPTER 21\\.

For example, the unem- ployment rate fell substantially and job creation increased in the United States, applications to Germany’s Kurzarbeit reduced-hours work program slowed sharply in May and continued declining steadily throughout August, and female labor force participation had partially recovered in Japan as of July after close to 1 million women left the labor force from January to April. •• Inflation. While prices of such items as medical supplies increased and commodity prices lifted from their April trough (Commodities Special Feature; Figure 1.4), the effects of weak aggregate demand appear to have outweighed the impact of supply interruptions.1 In sequential terms, inflation in 1The assessment is subject to an important caveat. The basket of goods and services used to measure consumer price inflation may not be representative of actual consumption patterns during the pan- demic and may underestimate the true increase in the cost of living. advanced economies remains below pre-pandemic levels (Figure 1.5). In emerging market and develop- ing economies inflation declined sharply in the initial stages of the pandemic, although it has since picked up in some countries (India, for example, reflecting supply disruptions and a rise in food prices). A unique recession. The downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has been very different from past recessions. In previous downturns, service-oriented sectors have tended to suffer smaller growth declines than manufacturing. In the current crisis, the public health response needed to slow transmission, together with behavioral changes, has meant that service sectors reliant on face-to-face interactions—particularly wholesale and retail trade, hospitality, and arts and entertainment—have seen larger contractions than manufacturing (Figure 1.6). The scale of disruption indicates that, without a vaccine and effective therapies to combat the virus, such sectors face a particularly difficult path back to any semblance of normalcy.

However, momentum going into the fourth quarter appears to be slowing. Business surveys of pur- chasing managers show firms in the United States, euro area, China, and Brazil, for example, expanded output successively in July and August compared with the previ- ous month, whereas the opposite was true elsewhere (for instance, in India, Japan, and Korea)—(Figure 1.7). For September, these indicators point to stronger activity in manufacturing but some setback for services, most likely reflecting the increase in infections.

Massive policy support has prevented worse outcomes. The bleak numbers that mark the COVID-19 reces- sion would have constituted far worse signposts had massive policy support not thwarted further slides in activity. As discussed in the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor, discretionary revenue and spending measures announced so far in advanced economies amount to more than 9 percent of GDP, with another 11 percent in various forms of liquidity support, including equity injections, asset purchases, loans, and credit guaran- tees.

New policy initiatives have also helped lift sentiment. Beyond their sheer scale, the novelty of the policy actions has also supported sentiment. Prominent examples of new initiatives include the €750 billion European Union pandemic recovery package–fund (more than half of it grant-based) and a wide range of temporary lifeline policies worldwide. The latter have included cash and in-kind transfers to affected firms and households; wage subsidies to maintain employment; expanded unemployment insurance coverage; tax deferrals; and regulatory initiatives to ease classification rules and provisioning requirements for banks’ nonper- forming loans, together with the release of buffers to help absorb losses. Central bank actions in advanced economies have involved more diverse, larger scales of asset purchases and relending facilities, supporting credit provision to a wide range of borrowers. The Federal Reserve also announced changes in its monetary policy strategy, moving to a flexible average inflation target of 2 percent over time. Emerging market central banks’ responses combined interest rate cuts, new relending facilities, and, for the first time in many cases, asset purchases (see Chapter 2 of the October 2020 Global Financial Stability Report \\[GFSR\\]). Financial conditions have generally continued to ease. These aggressive policy countermeasures have played a vital role in supporting sentiment and preventing fur- ther amplification of the COVID-19 shock through the financial system. Financial conditions have eased since June for advanced economies and for most emerging market and developing economies, implying a continu- ing disconnect between financial markets and the real economy that partly reflects the unprecedented policy support (as discussed in the October 2020 GFSR). •• Equity markets in advanced economies have mostly regained (and in some cases exceeded) their levels from the start of the year, sovereign bond yields are broadly unchanged or have declined further since June (as seen in Italy since the European Union’s pandemic recovery package was established and the European Central Bank’s pandemic emergency purchase program was expanded), and corporate spreads have dropped further, particularly for high- yield credit (benefiting, in the United States, from the Federal Reserve’s targeted lending facilities), as shown in Figure 1.8.

Spreads over US Treasury securities, which had begun falling after the Fed- eral Reserve’s aggressive actions in March to offset tighter financial conditions and dollar liquidity shortages, have continued to compress since June in line with stronger risk appetite (Figure 1.9). Equity markets in emerging market and developing economies have also generally firmed up since June (notably in China). Steps to support dollar liquidity (such as central bank swap lines), together with the recovery under way in China, have helped rekindle portfolio flows to some emerging markets after the sharp reversal in March (Figure 1.10). Nonetheless, as noted in the October 2020 GFSR, the recovery in portfolio flows is uneven, with some countries continuing to experience large outflows. •• Among major currencies, the dollar depreciated by over 4 ½ percent in real effective terms between April and late September, reflecting improving global risk sentiment and concerns about the impact of ris- ing COVID-19 cases on the speed of the US recov- ery. During the same period, the euro appreciated by close to 4 percent on improving economic prospects and slower increases in COVID-19 cases. The currencies of commodity exporters among advanced economies strengthened as commodity prices firmed. Most emerging market currencies recovered between April and June, after the severe pressures during the market turmoil in March. Since then the Chinese renminbi has strengthened and the currencies of other Asian emerging market economies have generally remained stable in real effective terms. In contrast, the Russian ruble depreciated on geopolit- ical factors and the currencies of countries severely affected by the pandemic or with a vulnerable exter- nal or fiscal position (such as Argentina, Brazil, and Turkey) have also weakened (Figure 1.11). Considerations for the Forecast Fundamental uncertainty regarding the pandemic and associated factors.

The baseline forecast rests on the following consider- ations and assumptions: •• Stronger-than-anticipated GDP outturns in the second quarter. The developments discussed in the previous section suggest that the worst may be over for now, but nothing is assured while the pandemic worsens and stalls reopening. A slightly less severe hit to activity than previously projected for the second quarter implies an upward revision to the 2020 fore- cast.

The baseline projection assumes that social distancing will continue into 2021 but will then fade over time as vaccine coverage expands and therapies improve, with local transmission brought to low levels everywhere by the end of 2022. Vac- cine trials have progressed at an unprecedented rate, and some have reached the final testing phase prior to approval or rejection. Nonetheless, even after approval, vaccine coverage is likely to expand only gradually as it will take time to scale up production and distribute adequate doses worldwide at afford- able prices. In countries where infection rates appear to have gone past their peak, persistent behavioral changes, together with enhanced workplace hygiene and safety standards, are assumed to keep new infections at a level that allows health care systems to cope with the caseload and without requiring a return to economy-wide lockdowns. For other coun- tries where infections are still rising, the baseline also assumes the possibility of renewed lockdowns for particular zones, even if stringent nationwide shutdowns are not repeated. •• Scarring. As in the WEO forecasts in April and June, the baseline also assumes that the deep downturn this year will damage supply potential to varying degrees across economies. The impact will depend on various factors discussed in the section on the medium-term growth outlook, including the extent of firm closures, exit of discouraged workers from the labor force, and resource mismatches (sectoral, occupational, and geographic). •• Policy support and financial conditions. Fiscal policy settings in the baseline reflect the $6 trillion direct tax and spending measures announced and imple- mented worldwide so far in response to the crisis (see the October 2020 Fiscal Monitor).

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOorD5qivlKr2EDLlPurrKrB1Tr759R_oZtMzJq_UPkH-xwZw139I#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

India has seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks over the last few years, which has turned data protection into a top security concern. According to **CERT-IN,** between **2021 and mid-2025,** India recorded more than **2.2 million** cybersecurity incidents, averaging more than **3,000 attacks per day,** with financial services, healthcare, telecom, and government platforms among the hardest hit. Hackers focused on cloud misconfigurations, unpatched servers, and weak internal access controls. The list below tracks **25 major cyberattacks in India** from 2021 to 2025, showing how they happened and what strategies can be used to prevent similar breaches. ## **1\\. Angel One AWS resource breach/potential data leakage, February 2025** Angel One, India's largest broking firm, was recently hacked. Hackers gained access to an unsecured AWS storage bucket linked to it, exposing the sensitive data of **7.9 million** users, such as trading details, email addresses, and customer IDs. Cloud management made sensitive data visible on public servers. To avoid such scams, similar companies must audit all cloud buckets, enable encryption, and always restrict public access through IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules. ## **2\\. AI-generated Phishing and Infostealer Surge, 2025** In 2025, several Indian banks and fintech platforms reported a rise in AI-generated phishing scams. Attackers used a realistic, AI-written email to fool users into giving away credentials. Thousands have already fallen victim to these smarter phishing campaigns by unknowingly entering their bank credentials, leading to financial losses and identity theft. Attackers also used voice cloning and deepfake technology to impersonate officials, which makes the deception look more convincing. One must consider the fact that constant user training, spam filters, and AI-based email scanning tools block most phishing messages before they reach inboxes. ## **3\\. Aditya Birla Capital Digital (ABCD) App Hack, 2025** Hackers targeted a weakness in the ABCD mobile app API, revealing customers' loan and PAN details. The attackers targeted unprotected endpoints, which allows data scraping. API vulnerabilities remain a growing concern for finance apps. However, routine code audits with secure token validation and regular app updates can stop such data exposure. ## **4\\. Star Health Threats, May 2025** Star Health, one of India's largest health insurers, experienced a major data breach that affected 31 million policyholders; much of the core information, including medical records, insurance details, and personal information, was breached and even published on the dark web. This breach shows how healthcare data can be exploited for identity theft. Encrypting health records, segmenting sensitive systems, and ensuring continuous monitoring can reduce such risks. ## **5\\. Delhi Hospitals Ransomware Attack, June 2025** Delhi's **Sant Parmanand** and **NKS Super Speciality** hospitals were targeted by ransomware that locked almost all patient and billing data. Over **60,000 records** were affected by this attack. The attack used phishing emails to deliver ransomware payloads. The malware spread quickly through unprotected hospital networks. Hospitals should isolate administrative and patient data systems, train staff to identify suspicious emails, and maintain offline data backups. ## **6\\. Kolkata Police Cyber Crime Wing Data Breach, August 2025** Weak internal passwords and a lack of access control allowed hackers to access internal police systems, where investigation details from the Cyber Wing in Kolkata were leaked. This breach exposed officer credentials and case data. The attack raised alarms about insider threats and the need for stronger law enforcement cybersecurity. Police and law enforcement agencies should adopt role-based access control, enforce password rotations, and enable two-factor authentication for internal systems. ## **7\\. Multiple Cyberattacks on Indian Governments, 2024.** Multiple state e-governance portals were hacked in 2024, leaking citizen Aadhaar and bank details. At least **2.5 million** records were compromised across several platforms. Many portals lacked basic HTTPS encryption, which allowed attackers to exploit outdated plugins and weak admin passwords. That's why regular CMS updates, secure admin logins, and government-wide cybersecurity policies are vital for protection. Every e-governance platform must undergo quarterly vulnerability assessments and follow a national cybersecurity standard to protect public data. ## **8\\. Polycab Ransomware Attack, March 2024** Polycab India, a top cable manufacturer, suffered a ransomware attack, causing a **Rs 20 crore** operational loss. The breach started from an infected employee workstation and ended with hackers encrypting internal files and demanding high payments. The attack also affected the supplier and distributor network, exposing the ripple effect of industrial cyber incidents. ## **9\\. Indian Energy Sector Attack, 2024** This breach shows the exposure of operational technology systems, where hackers tried to infiltrate India's power grid through malware-infected email attachments sent to energy employees. The attack aimed to disrupt the electricity supply but was quickly contained. **Tip:** Separating IT and OT networks and constantly monitoring power infrastructure can prevent major outages like this. Moreover, conducting red team simulations and regular cybersecurity drills helps reduce the chance of large-scale blackouts. ## **10\\. BSNL Data Breach, May 2024** Personal details of **2.9 million** broadband subscribers were leaked from a BSNL database due to old, unpatched systems. Leaked data included phone numbers and service details. The breach came from a neglected internal server. The outdated system, left without proper monitoring, became an easy entry point. Updating infrastructure and restricting admin access can prevent similar service providers. **Read Also: [Top 30 Best-Known Cybersecurity Case Studies 2025](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-best-known-cybersecurity-case-studies)** ## **11\\. UP Marriage Assistance Scheme Leak, 2024** The Uttar Pradesh Marriage Assistance Scheme is a welfare initiative aimed at helping low-income families. Data from the welfare portal of Uttar Pradesh leaked, including Aadhaar, bank details, and contact information, affecting **200,000** applicants. The data was found indexed on search engines, shockingly. The root cause was traced to poor web server configuration and missing access restrictions. A web firewall and regular penetration testing could have prevented this from happening. ## **12\\. Airtel India Customer Database Leak (375 Million Users), June 2024** Hackers claimed to sell a database of **375 million** users, which would be nearly **25%** of India's population. Airtel denied the break, but the data was widely shared online. The leak included Aadhaar numbers and personal details. Even if false, it revealed risks from third-party data handling. Telecom companies must run vendor audits and apply zero-trust security across all databases, anonymising customer data wherever possible to reduce exposure if leaks occur. ## **13\\. WazirX Hack, July 2024** Crypto firms must use cold wallets for storage and conduct third-party code audits before deploying smart contracts. WazirX, a crypto exchange, was targeted by hackers who were exploiting blockchain smart contract vulnerabilities. Roughly **$230 million** worth of assets were at risk. This breach clearly highlights that public blockchain code, if left unaudited, can create hidden backdoors. ## **14\\. boAt India Data Breach, 2023** Encrypting user data and applying hashed passwords are key to securing e-commerce databases. In 2023, an unsecured server was recently exposed, exposing **7.5 million** customer records, including names and contact information. The leak spread on Telegram and hacking forums. Weak password protection made recovery even harder. Many users later reported spam calls and targeted ads due to leaked data. ## **15\\. Telangana Police's Hawk Eye App Data Breach, 2023** Hackers accessed the Hawk Eye mobile app, revealing user profiles and feedback reports. The app, meant for citizen safety, accidentally exposed personal data through a misconfigured API. Public-facing government apps should use token-based access, secure API gateways and regular security reviews before each software update. **Read Also: [Top 50 Cyber Security Projects for Final Year Students (2025 Edition)](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/top-25-cyber-security-projects-for-final-year-students)** ## **16\\. Hyundai Motor India Data Leak, 2023** Thousands of car owners whose contact and vehicle details were stolen were found on the dark web. The source of the breach was traced to a third-party vendor responsible for managing the dealer's database. Weak vendor access controls and outdated security measures worsened the system, risking identity misuse because the data appeared on dark web forums for sale. ## **17\\. SPARSH Data Breach, 2023** The Ministry of Defence's SPARSH portal suffered a breach, which exposed pensioner IDs and bank details. Hackers used credential stuffing techniques on weak passwords. This breach raised national security concerns as the portal handled sensitive military data. Multi-factor authentication, stronger password policies, and regular login behaviour analysis can stop similar attacks. ## **18\\. Sun Pharma Cyber Attack, 2023** Pharmaceutical giant Sun Pharma's ransomware disrupted its internal operations and supply chain, causing **Rs. 30 crore** in losses. Hackers entered through a phishing email and encrypted internal servers. Companies should train employees to identify phishing attempts, install anti-ransomware software, and maintain offline data backups for rapid recovery. ## **19\\. BharatPe Hacked: August 2022** Phishing emails led to a breach of employees' inboxes, leaking internal documents and financial reports. The attackers used social engineering to mimic trusted contacts, tricking employees into sharing login credentials. While no customer data was stolen, the breach hurt investor confidence. Using email MFA, spam filters, and awareness campaigns can block future phishing attempts. ## **20\\. Cyberattack on AIIMS: December 2022** India's top hospital, AIIMS, suffered a ransomware attack that took **3 million** patient records. The servers remained slow for approximately two weeks, which caused major disruption. **Read Also: [The Rise of Agentic AI in Cyber Warfare: Implications for Global Security](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/the-rise-of-agentic-ai-in-cyber-warfare-implications-for-global-security)** ## **21\\. CloudSEK Data Breach: December 2022** In 2022, hackers stole internal data from the cybersecurity firm CloudSEK and exposed API keys on **GitHub.** The breach revealed how even security companies can be vulnerable. Never use credentials in code repositories, and rotate all access tokens regularly. ## **22\\. Swachhta Platform Hacked, September 2022** Hackers breached India's Swachh Bharat (Clean India) platform, a government site that collected public sanitation feedback and cleanliness reports. The attackers took advantage of outdated CMS plugins and weak credentials, allowing them to deface the homepage and delete parts of the citizen feedback database. ## **23\\. Zivame Data Breach, 2022** In 2022, Indian lingerie retailer Zivame experienced an excessive data breach exposing personal and transactional information of nearly **1.5 million** customers. The data included names, phone numbers, email addresses and partially masked payment records. Investigators traced the cause to an unsecured database server left open to the public without password protection. The leaked dataset appeared later on dark web forums for sale. ## **24\\. Air India / SITA Passenger Data Breach, 2021** Recently, in 2021, a global cyberattack on SITA, the IT provider for various airlines, exposed personal data of over **4.5 million** Air India passengers, which included passport details, ticket numbers, birth dates, and contact information. The breach was traced to unauthorised access in SITA's passenger service system, which connected multiple airlines worldwide, compromising long-term passenger privacy. That's why airlines and travel companies must vet all external vendors for compliance with strict cybersecurity standards, enforce encryption for shared databases and deploy continuous threat detection across connected systems. ## **25\\. Domino's India Customer Data Leak, 2021** Hackers exposed nearly **180 million** customer order details, including their names, phone numbers and even GPS coordinates. Attackers used an unsecured server within the company's order-tracking infrastructure, and later they published the full dataset on the dark web. The exposed location information was essentially alarming, as it could reveal customers' routines and residential details. Companies handling location-based services should encrypt all customer data, mask stored addresses and set strict retention periods for order records. **Read Also: [Zero Trust Security: The Future of Cyber Defense](https://www.eimt.edu.eu/zero-trust-security-the-future-of-cyber-defense)** ## **In the End** India's cybersecurity reflects both rapid progress and rising exposure. Attackers have now shifted to multi-stage ransomware, insider misuse, and AI-generated phishing. Organisations that invested early in zero-trust controls, employee awareness programmes, and regular threat monitoring have contained incidents faster and have limited damage. Every sector, private or public, must treat cybersecurity as an **operational priority** rather than a compliance task tied to reputation, customer trust, and business continuity. ## **Frequently Asked Questions** ### **Which sector faces the most cyber threats in India?** The financial, healthcare, telecom and e-commerce sectors top the list due to their high data value. Banking APIs, digital payment apps, and hospital systems are common ransomware and credential theft targets. ### **What are the main reasons behind the rise in cyberattacks in India?** The main reasons are rapid digitisation, weak password habits, over-reliance on cloud storage without proper encryption, and phishing campaigns using AI-written messages. ### **How can individuals protect themselves from data leaks in India?** Use unique passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, avoid public Wi-Fi for banking, and never click unknown links in SMS or WhatsApp messages.

From the wrath of [**cyclones**](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper1/cyclone-19) like **Odisha in 1999** to [**2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami**](https://www.drishtiias.com/printpdf/disaster-management-i#:~:text=The%20Indian%20Ocean%20Tsunami%20(2004,more%20than%202%20lakh%20people.) to the recent landslides triggered by [**Cyclone Remal**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-remal) in the Northeast, the country has witnessed the destructive force of nature. While the establishment of the [**National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-disaster-management-authority-1) marked a positive step. The very nature of disasters has undergone a drastic shift. [**Extreme weather events**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/himalayas-more-prone-to-extreme-weather-events), often intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent and severe. New threats like [**heat waves**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/heat-waves-and-heat-index#:~:text=Heat%20wave%20is%20considered%20if,C%20to%206.4%C2%B0C.) are emerging, and even more concerning is the rise of **multi-hazard disasters**, leading to cascading effects and far greater destruction. In this critical scenario, reactive measures are no longer enough. India needs a **proactive approach** that prioritizes disaster preparedness. ### What is the Framework Related to Disaster Management in India? - **Disaster Management Act of 2005:** The [**Disaster Management Act of 2005**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/disaster-management-act-2005-invoked) has provided the legal and institutional framework for disaster management in India at national, state and district levels. - While the **primary responsibility of disaster management rests with the States**, the Central Government supports the efforts of State Governments by providing logistical and financial support. - **Institutional Framework under Disaster Management Act of 2005** : - **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA):** Apex body headed by the **Prime Minister,** responsible for policy, plan, and guideline formulation for disaster management (DM). - NDMA addresses both **natural and man-made disasters** and coordinates enforcement and implementation. - **National Executive Committee (NEC):** Assists NDMA, chaired by the Union **Home Secretary,** comprising various secretaries and officials. - Prepares and monitors the National Plan for DM and coordinates responses to disaster situations. - **State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA):** Headed by the **Chief Minister,** responsible for state-level DM policies and plans, coordinating implementation, and integrating mitigation measures in state development plans. - **District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA):** Led by the **District Collector** with an elected representative as Co-Chairperson. - Prepares and implements district-level DM plans and ensures compliance with national and state policies. - **Local Authorities:** Includes **[Panchayati Raj Institutions](https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/panchayati-raj-institution-pri), [Municipalities](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/urban-local-government-in-india)**, **District and Cantonment Boards**, and Town Planning Authorities. Responsible for capacity building, relief, rehabilitation, and preparing DM plans. - **Key Institutions:** - **National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM)**: Focuses on capacity development, training, research, and documentation. - Functions under NDMA’s guidelines and aims to become a **‘Centre of Excellence’ in DM.** - **National Disaster Response Force (NDRF):** Specialized response force for natural and man-made disasters, including Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear emergencies. - Operates under NDMA's direction, with eight battalions positioned across different locations. - **Committees:** - **Cabinet Committee on Management of Natural Calamities (CCMNC):** Oversees management of natural calamities, suggests preventive measures, and promotes public awareness. - **International Commitments:** - [**Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR):**](https://www.drishtiias.com/summary-of-important-reports/sendai-framework-report) India is a signatory to the SFDRR which was adopted during the **Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction** in March 2015. - India is dedicated to achieving the seven goals set under the framework through systematic and sustainable efforts. - **Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA):** India is a signatory to the HFA, adopted globally to reduce disaster losses in lives and economic and environmental assets. - The HFA set three strategic goals and five priority action areas focused on integrating disaster risk reduction into **sustainable development policies,** capacity building, preparedness, and vulnerability reduction. ### What are the Current Major Disaster Threats that India Faces? - **Floods**: India experiences frequent [**floods**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/floods-havoc-in-india#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20cause%20of,dams%2C%20barrages%2C%20or%20siltation.), particularly during the monsoon season. Over **40 million hectares (12% of land)** are prone to floods and river erosion. It is getting exacerbated by [**Glacial Lake Outburst Floods.**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/glacial-lake-outburst-flood#:~:text=A%20glacial%20lake%20outburst%20flood,or%20the%20inflow%20of%20meltwater.) - **Examples:** Floods in **Bihar (2023), Assam** (2022) - **Cyclones and Storms**: India's coastline is susceptible to cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Of the **7,516 km long coastline**, approximately **5,700 km** is vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis. - **Examples: [Cyclone Biparjoy](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/india-s-cyclone-preparedness) (2023)** and **[Cyclone Fani](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-fani) (2019).** - **Earthquakes:** India is located in a seismically active region, with several fault lines running across the country. 58.6% of the landmass is prone to moderate to very high intensity earthquakes. - **Examples:** Earthquake in **Mizoram** (2022), Earthquake in **Sikkim** (2011) - **Droughts:** Prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall patterns can lead to severe [**droughts,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/drought-in-europe) affecting agriculture and water resources. **68%** of the cultivable area is susceptible to drought. - **Examples:** Drought in 66% of **Maharashtra** (2024). - **Landslides:** Hilly and mountainous regions in India are prone to [**landslides**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/landslide-atlas-of-india#:~:text=Landslides%20are%20natural%20disasters%20occurring,slope%20is%20termed%20a%20landslide.), especially during heavy rainfall or earthquakes. India is considered among the top five landslide-prone countries globally. - **Examples:** Landslides in **Himachal Pradesh (** 2023), Landslides in **Manipur** (2022). - **Heat Waves:** Rising temperatures and prolonged periods of high heat can lead to life-threatening heat waves. - **Examples:** Heat waves across India (2022, 2023, 2024). - The country reported **280 heat wave days** from 11th March- 18th May, 2022. - **Forest Fires:** Dry conditions and human activities can contribute to [**forest fires,**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/forest-fires-9#:~:text=Also%20called%20bush%20or%20vegetation,e.g.%2C%20wind%2C%20topography).) causing environmental damage and air pollution. Based on the forest inventory records, **54.40% of forests in India** are exposed to occasional fires - **Examples:** Forest fires in **Himachal Pradesh (2024)** and Forest fires in **Goa** (2023). - **Industrial and Chemical Accidents:** India's growing industrial sector and improper handling of hazardous materials can lead to industrial and chemical accidents. - **Examples:** Chemical spill in **Surat** (2023), Industrial fire in **Mumbai** (2024). ### What Factors are Exacerbating India’s Disaster Risk? - **Urbanization and Unplanned Development:** Rapid urbanization and unplanned development in cities have increased the vulnerability to disasters like floods and earthquakes. - **Example:** The **2023 Chennai floods** were attributed to unchecked development and encroachment on water bodies and wetlands. - **Rising Climate Change Impact:** Climate change is amplifying the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, and droughts. - **Example**: The devastating [**Cyclone Amphan in 2020**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-analysis/cyclone-amphan) was fueled by warmer ocean temperatures due to climate change. - **Aging Infrastructure and Lack of Maintenance:** India's aging infrastructure, such as **dams, bridges, and buildings, coupled** with inadequate maintenance, increases the risk of disasters. - The **Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water** in 2023 raised concerns over the safety of aging dams that are **more than 100 years old.** - **Environmental Degradation:** Activities like **deforestation, mining, and unsustainable land-use practices** have increased the risk of landslides and soil erosion. - **Example:** The [**2022 Joshimath land subsidence crisis**](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/joshimath-land-subsidence) in Uttarakhand was attributed to unregulated construction and mining activities. - **Industrial and Technological Hazards:** India's growing industrialization and reliance on hazardous materials increase the risk of industrial accidents and chemical disasters. - **Example:** The gas leak at a chemical plant in **Visakhapatnam** (2020) exposed thousands to toxic fumes. ### What Measures Should India Adopt to Reduce Disaster Risk and Enhance Disaster Preparedness? - **Establish Dedicated Disaster Response Corridors:** Designate and develop dedicated disaster response corridors, including **road networks, rail links, and air routes,** to ensure uninterrupted access for emergency services and aid during disasters. - These corridors could be designed to be resilient to hazards and equipped with necessary infrastructure and resources for efficient disaster response. - **Promote Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure:** Mandate the adoption of disaster-resilient design and construction principles for all critical infrastructure projects, such as bridges, dams, power plants, and communication networks. - Implementing **stricter building codes** that mandate disaster-resistant construction using **earthquake-proof materials, fire-proof materials and wind-resistant designs**. - Additionally, offering tax breaks and financial assistance for retrofitting existing structures to improve their resilience. - **Develop Disaster-Resilient Agricultural Practices:** Promote the adoption of disaster-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crops, precision farming, and soil conservation techniques. - Learning from successful examples like **Burkina Faso's Zai pit farming technique,** which enhances soil moisture retention and crop yields during droughts. - **Promote Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR):** Integrate ecosystem-based approaches into disaster risk reduction strategies by conserving, restoring, and sustainably managing natural ecosystems like **forests, [wetlands](http://wetlands), and coastal habitats.** - These ecosystems can act as **natural barriers against hazards like floods, storms, and landslides,** while also providing co-benefits like carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. - **Strengthen Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems:** Develop robust, integrated early warning systems that can detect and provide timely alerts for multiple hazards, such as cyclones, floods, heatwaves, and landslides. - Leveraging advanced technologies like **[remote sensing](https://www.drishtiias.com/current-affairs-news-analysis-editorials/news-editorials/2023-05-12), AI, and [big data analytics](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper3/big-data-1)** to improve hazard monitoring, forecasting, and risk communication. - **Micronet Grids for Critical Infrastructure:** Establish localized, self-sufficient power grids powered by renewable sources like solar and micro-hydro for critical infrastructure like hospitals and communication systems. - This ensures continued functionality even during widespread power outages caused by disasters. - **Mental Health Response Teams:** Integrating mental health professionals into disaster response efforts to provide **psychological support** to survivors dealing with trauma, anxiety, and displacement. This can significantly improve long-term recovery outcomes. - **Enhanced Institutional Capacity:** The institutions must hire permanent workforce rather than contractual. - A permanent workforce allows for continuous **skill development, knowledge transfer, and institutional memory.** - This fosters a more capable disaster management system compared to relying on temporary staff who may lack experience. - Moreover, the Local bodies should be allocated a substantial **Disaster Readiness Reserve to complement disaster reactivity to proactive measures.** | | | --- | | **_Drishti Mains Question:_** Examine the factors contributing to India's increasing vulnerability to disasters.What measures should India adopt to enhance its disaster preparedness?? | ### UPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question (PYQ) ### _Mains:_ **Q.** Discuss the recent measures initiated in disaster management by the Government of India departing from the earlier reactive approach. **(2020)** **Q.** Vulnerability is an essential element for defining disaster impacts and its threat to people.

    "title": "Dealing with violent civil protests in India",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

    "full_text": "# India's Geographic Vulnerability to Climate Change Industry Updates 17 mins September 25, 2024 Manasvi Patel ## **World Environmental Health Day 2024** World Environmental Health Day 2024 focuses on the theme \"Environmental Health: Creating Resilient Communities through Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation.\" This theme underscores the critical need to enhance community resilience in the face of climate-related disasters, which have become increasingly frequent and severe due to global warming. By emphasizing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation, this year's theme calls for integrated approaches that not only protect public health but also ensure sustainable development. India's unique geography and climate make it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. With 27 out of 29 states and 7 union territories susceptible to natural hazards like floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes, the country faces an uphill battle against the devastating impacts of climate change. As World Environmental Health Day 2024 approaches, it's crucial for India to take bold steps to enhance community resilience and protect its vulnerable populations. ### Geographical Factors Contributing to Disaster Risk India's geographical factors significantly contribute to its disaster risk profile, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The combination of its diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors creates a complex landscape of [vulnerabilities](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf): - [**Earthquakes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.7059oimyb6r3): Approximately 58.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to earthquakes, with the country situated in a seismically active zone due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. - [**Coastal Vulnerability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.sipw79xc52s): India's coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, exposes it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. - [**Floods**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.af8gn4f1799i) and [**droughts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.xdkivgfc02df): about 40 million hectares (around 12% of the land) are prone to floods and river erosion, while 68% of cultivable land is vulnerable to droughts. - [**Landslides**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.kmor8crhvnf7) and avalanches: The hilly regions are also at risk from landslides and avalanches, further compounding the disaster risk faced by various communities across the nation. #### Seismic Activity India is situated at the convergence of several tectonic plates, making it prime for earthquakes. ~58% of the country’s landmass is classified as being at risk for earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. This seismic vulnerability is particularly pronounced in regions such as the Himalayan belt, which experiences tremors due to ongoing tectonic activity. ##### The Gujarat (Bhuj) Earthquake (2001) For instance, the [2001 Bhuj earthquake](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bhuj-earthquake-of-2001), which registered a magnitude of 7.7, resulted in over 20,000 deaths and injured more than 150,000 others. The earthquake affected approximately 28 million people, destroyed more than 400,000 buildings, with the telecom building collapsing, Bhuj was isolated from the rest of the state; the most seriously affected was the Kandla port (the busiest port in India) which caters to handling crucial imports of petroleum products, crude oil and chemicals and export of agricultural commodities, with about five of the 10 jetties damaged. Over 10,000 small and medium industrial units had to stop production due to damage to plants, factories, and machinery. The Indian State Department [estimates](https://www.adrc.asia/publications/recovery_reports/Gujarat.pdf) that the earthquake affected, directly or indirectly, 15.9 million people out of 37.8 million. The government estimated the direct economic loss at $1.3 billion, while estimates indicate this could be as high as $5 billion. Following the earthquake, emergency relief operations were launched by both government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs): - [ActionAid India](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/gujarat-earthquake-2001/) mobilized local community-based organizations to provide immediate assistance in the most affected areas, by establishing temporary shelters, distributed food and medical supplies, and set up psycho-social counseling services for survivors. - The government initiated a [comprehensive rehabilitation plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm) that included new building codesto ensure that the structures were designed to be earthquake-resistant; and infrastructure redevelopment of roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities was prioritized. - Emphasizing on community participation in planning and implementing disaster management strategies, village-level committees were formed to enhance local capacity for disaster response. - A [State Disaster Management Plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm#:~:text=Gujarat%20State%20Disaster%20Management%20Authority%20(GSDMA)%2C%20which%20would%20implement%20the%20reconstruction%20and%20rehabilitation%2C%20with%20support%20from%20various%20other%20agencies%20in%20the%20quake%2Dhit%20area.) was created that integrated lessons learned from the earthquake, and focused on risk assessment, early warning systems, and community-based disaster management practices aimed at reducing vulnerability to future seismic events. The resilience-building activities undertaken after the Gujarat earthquake reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate relief with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. These efforts underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in seismically active regions like India #### Coastal Vulnerability India's long coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, makes it highly vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis, [exposing](https://irade.org/Sustainable%20and%20Disaster%20Resilient%20Urban%20DevelopmentFinal%20.pdf) it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which have borne the brunt of devastating cyclones in recent years. ###### Cyclone Fani (2019) Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, serves as a prime example of the destruction that coastal areas face. The [extremely severe](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cyclone-fani-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment) cyclonic storm caused extensive damage across 14 districts in Odisha, [affecting](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2019-000041-ind) at least 10 million people in the North-eastern Sates of India. Despite the early evacuation of a million people, the cyclone has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of more than 28 million people across 3 States in India. [Total damage](https://ncds.nic.in/sites/default/files/OEDS3NCDS.pdf) to existing stock of assets has been estimated at over $2.4 billion, whereas the economic losses flowing from the disaster are estimated at nearly ~$1.1 billion. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, several resilience-building activities were implemented to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts: - [The Government of Odisha](https://www.unicef.org/media/82111/file/India-Cyclone-Fani-SitRep-12-May-2019.pdf) coordinated one of the largest emergency preparedness exercises, mobilizing over 45,000 volunteers and 100,000 officials to ensure effective communication and evacuation protocols. This effort enabled the successful evacuation of approximately 1.47 million people from low-lying areas before the cyclone made landfall. - The state government constructed hundreds of cyclone shelters along the coast to provide safe refuge during storms, which were stocked with essentials like food and water. - Local stakeholders, NGOs, and civil society organizations collaborated with the government to conduct training programs on disaster preparedness including educating communities about evacuation routes and safety measures The resilience-building activities undertaken after Cyclone Fani reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate response efforts with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. The lessons learned from this cyclone underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in coastal regions like Odisha. #### Flood-Prone Areas Over 40 million hectares (about 12% of India’s land) is [prone to floods and river erosion](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf). The monsoon season often brings heavy rainfall leading to river overflow and flash floods, particularly in states like Assam and Bihar. ##### Assam Floods (2023) Assam, a state in northeastern India, is characterized by its fertile Brahmaputra Valley, which supports a rich agricultural sector. The state’s agriculture is primarily based on rice, tea, and jute, and it benefits from the regular monsoon rains that sustain its crops. The geographical features of Assam, including its river basins and low-lying areas, contribute significantly to its susceptibility to flooding. In 2023, Assam experienced devastating floods that [impacted](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/india-whats-really-behind-assams-worsening-floods) over 2.5 million people. In response to the challenges posed by flooding, particularly following the severe floods in 2023, several resilience-building activities have been undertaken in Assam: - The Assam government allocated Rs 1200 crs in 2023-24 for the [construction and maintenance](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Development%3A%20The%20Assam%20government%20has%20allocated%20Rs%201%2C200%20crore%20for%20the%20construction%20and%20maintenance%20of%20flood%20control%20infrastructure%2C%20including%20embankments%20and%20flood%20barriers%2C%20for%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20period.) of flood control infrastructure, including embarkments and drainage systems and investment aimed to enhance the state's capacity to manage floodwaters effectively and reduce the risk of future inundations. - The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) invested ₹25 crores in developing advanced flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems provide alerts up to three days in advance, allowing communities to prepare for impending floods and evacuate if necessary. - The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) [covers](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=The%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Fasal%20Bima%20Yojana%20(PMFBY)%20covers%20around%2056%25%20of%20the%20farmers%20in%20Assam%20as%20of%202023.%20This%20scheme%20provides%20insurance%20coverage%20against%20crop%20losses%20due%20to%20natural%20calamities.) around 56% of farmers in Assam as of 2023, providing insurance against crop losses due to natural calamities. This scheme is crucial for protecting farmers' livelihoods and ensuring financial support during disasters. - A Community-Based Disaster Management project was launched in 2023, aimed at building local capacity for flood management in 100 selected gram panchayats focusing on on empowering communities with knowledge and resources to respond effectively to floods. In 2023, Assam introduced a ' [green budget](https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/09/28/improving-climate-resilience-in-flood-prone-assam-india/)' committing approximately $2 billion towards climate change action and disaster risk reduction, aiming to enhance long-term resilience against climate-related disasters through sustainable development practices. The resilience-building activities implemented in Assam following recent floods reflect a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, promoting community engagement, and introducing innovative financial mechanisms like insurance schemes and green budgets, Assam is working towards building a more resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding the impacts of flooding. #### Drought and Water Scarcity Drought and water scarcity are significant challenges in India, with [about](https://nidm.gov.in/pdf/trgReports/2021/July/Report_29July2021sk.pdf) 68% of the country's cultivable area vulnerable to these conditions. ##### Rajasthan Drought and Water Scarcity Rajasthan, the largest state in India, faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and drought leading to crop failures and economic distress among farmers. The state has [limited water resources](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/261801490687132806/pdf/113703-WP-Water-Assessment-and-Potential-for-Private-Sector-Interventions-PUBLIC.pdf), with only 1.16% of India's total water supply, making it particularly susceptible to prolonged drought conditions. It's among the most [vulnerable to droughts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/29/surajpura-rajasthan-india-drought-villagers-farmers-climate#:~:text=ajasthan%2C%20India%E2%80%99s%20largest%20state%2C%20is%20among%20the%20most%20vulnerable%20to%20droughts%2C%20with%2098%25%20of%20its%20250%20village%20blocks%20in%20sectors%20marked%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdark%20zones%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20areas%20with%20dangerously%20low%20groundwater%20levels%20%E2%80%93%20and%20almost%207%25%20of%20the%20land%20uncultivable), with 98% of its 250 village blocks in sectors marked as “dark zones” – areas with dangerously low groundwater levels – and almost 7% of the land uncultivable. In response to the recurring drought conditions, several resilience-building activities have been implemented in Rajasthan: - Rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques were introduced to mitigate the effects of droughts and were prioritized via traditional techniques such as Anictus, Bairis, and tanks. In 2023, after an [unusually high rainfall](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/climate-opportunity-how-did-rajasthan-harvest-rainwater-after-the-early-monsoon-of-2023--94579) of 588.9 mm (nearly 2X the normal amount) villagers utilized these methods to direct the water into ponds and storage system, providing drinking water [for upto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwXQurAJLKs) 1.5 years in some villages. - The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project, costing a total of $495 million, of which $345 million is [financed](https://www.ndb.int/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rajasthan-Water-00012.pdf) by the New Development Bank, aimed to rehabilitate the Indira Gandhi Canal System, covering over 990 km of canal systems, reclamation of more than 33,000 km of waterlogged areas, and implementation of micro-irrigation techniques. Government schemes like the [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana](https://pmksy.gov.in/) (PMKSY) were implemented to focus on enhancing irrigation facilities, along with the introduction of a crop insurance scheme to protect farmers from losses due to drought. Despite these resilience-building efforts, Rajasthan continues to face the challenges posed by recurring droughts. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by its arid climate, limited water resources, and high dependence on agriculture. Sustained efforts and investments in water management, and agricultural practices are crucial for mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring food security in the region. #### Topography and Landslides India's diverse topography includes mountainous regions that are particularly vulnerable to landslides and avalanches, especially during the monsoon season. The Himalayan region, along with the Western Ghats, experiences heavy rainfall that can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. One of the most devastating recent events occurred in Wayanad, Kerala, where a series of landslides on July 30, 2024, resulted in significant loss of life and property. ##### The Wayanad Landslides (2024) On July 30, 2024, Wayanad district in Kerala was struck by catastrophic landslides that resulted from extreme rainfall. [The region](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece) received 572 mm of rainfall within 48 hours leading up to the disaster, causing hillsides to collapse in the villages of Mundakkai and Chooralmala. This resulted in over 336 fatalities, ~397 were injured, and at least 118 missing. The debris flow altered the course of the Iruvanjipuzha River, exacerbating flooding conditions in surrounding areas. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) [reported](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/86000-sq-metres-of-land-slipped-away-debris-travelled-8-km-along-iruvanjippuzha-river-isro-satellite-images-reveal/articleshow/112231968.cms?from=mdr) that about 86,000 square meters of land had shifted due to the landslide. In response to the Wanayd landslides, several activities were initiated: - A [rescue operation](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece#:~:text=On%20August%201%2C%20Chief%20Minister%20Pinarayi%20Vijayan%20said%20over%209%2C300%20people%20were%20staying%20in%2091%20relief%20camps%20in%20Wayanad%20district.) was mobilized involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local authorities, over 9,300 people were accommodated in relief camps across the district. - [Experts](https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-on-the-trail-of-the-wayanad-landslide/) have called for implementing site-specific land-use policies and improving drainage management to mitigate future risks. Additionally, establishing local landslide early warning systems (LEWS) has been recommended to enhance community preparedness. The Wayanad landslides highlight the urgent need for improved land management practices and disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions of India. By implementing effective resilience-building strategies, including community engagement and infrastructure improvements, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of future landslides and protect lives and livelihoods. India's unique geographical factors significantly contribute to its vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors create a complex landscape of risks, including earthquakes, coastal vulnerability, floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events due to global warming. To address these challenges, India must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into its development plans. Building resilient communities requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes strengthening early warning systems, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and adopting sustainable practices.

Along with an exchange of drone strikes, conventional missile firings, and aerial dogfights, the skirmish continued in the information domain, with Pakistani media reporting that the country’s military cyber wing [disrupted](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546050/security-sources-reveal-details-of-pakistans-massive-cyberattack-against-india) a communications network in India, predominantly affecting power distribution lines and government websites. Meanwhile, hackers sympathetic to the Indian government [leaked](https://x.com/cyberforcex) compromised data from Pakistan’s taxation authority and [targeted](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/how-pro-india-hackers-defended-country-during-cross-border-cyberattacks-amid-op-sindoor/articleshow/121385229.cms) other digital infrastructure. The active incorporation of cyber operations in this recent crisis, at least as acknowledged in public media reporting on both sides, is a departure from the past. It also raises serious concerns about the challenge of attribution on the subcontinent. Assigning responsibility for cyber operations comes with political, legal, and technical challenges. For one, in hostile India-Pakistan ties, there is limited space to entertain an ill-substantiated or inaccurate attribution as it risks escalation or creates domestic pressure for retaliation. Also, public attribution may be limited by the lack of well-established national frameworks for doing so. Neither India nor Pakistan currently have an official public attribution policy, making it difficult to assess their evidentiary standards and the validity of their threat intelligence. Limited official documents on procedures for incident response and forensic capacity suggest caution with regard to the credibility of public attribution. Thirdly, in cyber geopolitics, public attribution is a strategic choice determined by decisionmakers on a case-by-case basis. Cyber operations work best when clandestine and thus attribution is often intentionally restricted to avoid exposing technical capability. This is likely why Pakistan and India have generally approached official public attribution for cyber operations with caution in the past. The deployment of cyber-attacks complementary to kinetic operations along with unverifiable and potentially premature public attribution could set a dangerous precedent for a strategic environment as hostile and fragile as South Asia. Thus, in the absence of credible attribution tools and mechanisms, Islamabad and New Delhi would have to firmly resolve to adhere to responsible state behavior in cyberspace by doing the following: 1) establishing a cyber hotline to ensure communication channels are open, 2) supporting the applicability of international law to cyberspace, and 3) committing to non-proliferation of intrusive cyber technologies to non-state Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to conduct cyber operations on their behalf. [\\[1\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn1) More broadly for each, institutionalizing their attribution process would ensure transparency and reassurance. **India and Pakistan’s Cyber Doctrines** Even apart from its prominent role in the recent India-Pakistan crisis, cybersecurity has found a significant place in both countries’ national security postures in recent years. In 2019, then Indian Minister of State for Defence [confirmed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-approves-setting-up-of-defence-cyber-agency/articleshow/72264836.cms) the development of a defense cyber agency to handle cyber threats in a military context as well as budgetary allocations for cyber operations. In 2021, India’s former National Security Advisor acknowledged New Delhi’s capability to conduct “ [cyber sabotage and cyber warfare _._](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/M.-K.-Narayanan-on-India-Pakistan-diplomacy-and-terrorism/article55940567.ece)” And in 2024, the Indian Ministry of Defence [announced](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-formulate-new-doctrine-for-cyberspace-operations/articleshow/111094158.cms) a joint doctrine for cyberspace operations, shifting away from the country’s previous policy of strategic ambiguity on the use of cyber in the warfare domain, and integrating both [defensive and offensive capabilities](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2153626). [\\[2\\]](https://southasianvoices.org/southasianvoices.org#_ftn2) While Pakistan does not have a pronounced cyber doctrine, Islamabad’s national security posture reflects the necessity of integrating cyber capabilities with military operations. Inaugurating the Army’s Cyber Division in 2018, the then Chief of Army Staff articulated that “ [firepower and cyber have emerged as the mainstay of future war.”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2369646/firepower-cyber-have-emerged-as-mainstay-of-future-war-coas) Pakistan has also invested in cyber capacity, as the [2021 National Cybersecurity Policy](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) reiterates, to protect national critical infrastructure as well as government information systems. These policy documents underline that India and Pakistan recognize the importance of investing in cyber capability to uphold their national interests. The next section explores how each state potentially uses these capabilities for strategic gain. **Cyber Capability and Operations** Countries are increasingly employing state capabilities to conduct cyber operations to achieve strategic objectives such as intelligence gathering; Pakistan and India are no different. Over the past few years, each state is alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage. This is done either through state capability or threat actors backed by the state. Publicly available information suggests that [APT 36](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-36)—also known as [Transparent Tribe](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector/) and [SideCopy](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/operation_c-major)—is a Pakistan-linked APT group, alleged to have conducted cyber [espionage](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) particularly in India and Afghanistan. Likewise, APT groups such as [Sidewinder](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/#%3A~%3Atext%3DSidewinder%20is%20a%20suspected%20Indian%2CChina%2C%20Nepal%2C%20and%20Afghanistan) and [Patchwork](https://medium.com/@Ab_Hussain/indian-apts-target-middle-east-1e4a11b3ce95) are thought to be Indian state-backed threat actors, conducting cyber operations in Pakistan and elsewhere. > “Over the past few years, \\[India and Pakistan are\\] alleged to have engaged in malicious and covert cyber activities such as hacking official websites, conducting coordinated phishing campaigns, and cyber espionage.” While there is limited information publicly available regarding the cyber operations conducted by each side, some sources do point to state acquiescence or support. A report by a Canadian firm [revealed](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/media/27613/ocr) that in 2021, the Indian government had allegedly conducted [cyber surveillance](https://www.dawn.com/news/1636767) on Pakistan’s [political leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/) using the Israeli [Pegasus software](https://www.mcafee.com/learn/what-is-pegasus-spyware/). India-based hacking groups reportedly continued to [target](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) Pakistani government entities in the following years aiming to infiltrate systems and access computer controls. Similarly, media reports claimed that Pakistan-based hackers had [deployed](https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents) malware against Indian government and defense sectors, attempting to gain access to sensitive information. In 2019, the cyber-attack on India’s nuclear facility, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, was thought by some [analysts](https://www.orfonline.org/research/decoding-motives-behind-the-kudankulam-intrusion-58083) to have been perpetrated by Pakistan, though there was no public attribution. The technical attribution by cybersecurity firms [pointed](https://www.vifindia.org/sites/default/files/cyber-attack-on-kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant.pdf) to a North Korean state-sponsored entity, the Lazarus Group. This complex picture of the potential use of proxies points to the challenge of attribution in an India-Pakistan context. **The Attribution Challenge** Attribution in cyberspace is the process of identifying and assigning responsibility to threat actors behind the cyber operation or malicious activity. However, attribution is rarely straightforward because, unlike physical crimes, cyber actors can hide behind the anonymity of the internet or impersonate other computers. Threat actors can also remain in the system undetected, silently stealing information through stolen passwords or impersonation. In terms of technical challenges, the sophistication of the operation depending on capability could also make it difficult to trace the crime back to an actor. For instance, during the India-Pakistan crisis in May, the Indian cyber agency, Maharashtra Cyber, reported a significant surge in cyber-attacks [originating](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace#:~:text=noted%20a%20surge%20in%20DDoS,in%20these%20cyberattacks%20as%20it) from Pakistan as well as countries like Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh. Threat actors using the location of a third country is often a deliberate and popular tactic to confuse the perpetrator’s identity and origin, as an IP address is usually the first source of identification. A popular global example is the 2018 [Olympic Destroyer cyberattack in South Korea](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/olympic-destroyer/21494/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the,uproar%20was%20no%20laughing%20matter.), when the [Russian threat actors](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/) used sophisticated tactics to conceal their identity, enabling the blame to be deflected to North Korea and China. Thus, even if one actor might visibly be responsible, there might be someone else behind the keyboard. Moreover, technical attribution requires advanced threat intelligence capability, without which attribution could be erroneous and enable “false flag” categorization. For example, recently, Russian state-linked cyber group Turla allegedly attempted to access data exfiltrated from Indian military networks. Threat intelligence by Microsoft and Lumen’s BlackLotus Labs indicate that Turla [compromised a network](https://cyberscoop.com/turla-infiltrates-pakistani-apt-networks-microsoft-lumen/) of Pakistan-based group SideCopy to spy on the Indian network. This created a false impression, shifting the blame towards Pakistan. This reiterates that the use of sophisticated techniques in an operation and the lack of advanced capability for forensic analysis can potentially obscure a threat actor’s identity, making attribution a challenge. Even advanced nations struggle with having requisite forensic capacity, so relatively newer cyber entrants like India and Pakistan will have to invest more efforts in this space. The key legal challenge India and Pakistan face regarding attribution is the lack of a transparent, and credible attribution framework. Unlike some countries, India and Pakistan do not have a formal attribution policy, making it difficult for independent analysts to assess the validity of their institutional processes. In practice, the process involves a loose [network of agencies](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/09/mapping-indias-cybersecurity-administration-in-2025?lang=en) coordinating technical and intelligence findings, raising concerns about the lack of consistent and verifiable evidentiary standards. It was in highlighting some of these challenges that Pakistan’s 2023 [position](https://docs-library.unoda.org/Open-Ended_Working_Group_on_Information_and_Communication_Technologies_-_(2021)/UNODA.pdf) on applicability of international law in cyberspace emphasized cross-border coordination and cooperation globally to ensure substantiated attribution. A lack of consistent evidentiary standards complicates attribution and can leave such efforts open to criticism as being politically motivated, making it critical for India and Pakistan to address this lacuna. This leads to the political challenge of attribution. The United States and [Five Eyes](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/fv-cntry-mnstrl-en.aspx) allies often attribute cyber-attacks when they need to reinforce international pressure on political adversaries or justify policy shifts. New Delhi and Islamabad have approached attribution rather cautiously. Though there are multiple reasons for this, the obvious one is to avoid jumping the gun and pointing to an adversary, which may create a particularly dangerous scenario of escalation. **Redefining Crises and Stability in South Asia** Attribution uncertainty creates costs for stability in South Asia and risks escalation in a future India- Pakistan crisis. Both countries share a hostile past and a tense strategic environment, leaving limited space for misunderstanding and miscalculation. A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing, tarnishing trust on both sides and instilling doubt. Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression. Pakistan’s 2021 Cyber Security Policy explicitly mentions that a cyberattack on critical infrastructure would be regarded as an [act of aggression](https://moitt.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy%202021%20Final.pdf) and be met with an appropriate response. > “A misattributed cyber operation, especially on or near critical nuclear infrastructure, could be destabilizing \\[…\\] Misperceptions about the intent of a cyber operation could lead to retaliatory action, especially if interpreted as a deliberate act of aggression.” Another predicament is the question of proportionate response to an offensive cyber intrusion conducted by a state or state-linked threat actors without clear attribution. This is a conundrum faced by states globally, not just India and Pakistan. Determining what is a proportionate response in cyberspace currently lies at the discretion of the state. Some countries have included the principle of proportionality in formal statements unpacking how they interpret international law as applying to their conduct in cyberspace. According to its 2023 statement, while Pakistan acknowledges proportionality as applying in the context of conflict and international humanitarian law, it does not otherwise present views on response. India has not yet published a national statement. Such norms and behavior are either unaddressed or awaiting legal applicability in international frameworks. For the complicated security environment of South Asia, integration of cyber capability without legal clarity is thus worrisome. In times of active conflict, cyber operations, including information and influence operations, can create a [fog of war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQvsb4ouuI0) for decisionmakers and undermine the process of crisis management. Persistent cyber intrusions could also further compromise trust and impact and possibly backtrack the confidence-building measures (CBMs) already in place between India and Pakistan. Given that nuclear CBMs between India and Pakistan are already tenuous, a potential cyber-attack or even a data breach could be misperceived as altering the balance of power. **Policy Recommendations** To ensure that cyber does not introduce yet another element of uncertainty and that the precarious balance of power is maintained on the subcontinent, policymakers in India and Pakistan should: **_Establish a cyber hotline:_** Cyber operations can perpetuate misperception and misunderstanding, especially with attribution challenges. Therefore, rapid communication during a cyber crisis is critical. Both countries could exchange doctrines, ensure technical cooperation, and maintain a directory in case of crisis. Cyber CBMs, including hotlines and dedicated focal points for exchange, can also potentially enhance a sense of predictability. **_Support the applicability of international law to cyberspace:_** While there is consensus across the board that international law applies to cyberspace, states are still discussing how core legal principles and existing commitments, such as the non-use of force, proportionality, sovereignty, and due diligence, apply to cyberspace. Islamabad and New Delhi are advised to actively adhere to international and bilateral negotiations, such as the UN’s recently launched Global Mechanism on ICTs, successor to the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. Pakistan published its national position paper in 2023 outlining the applicability of international law. India could follow suit, to maintain accountability and transparency. **_Commit to restraining proliferation of offensive intrusion capabilities:_** To dodge attribution and accountability, states often employ non-state APT groups to influence cyber operations. This results in proliferation of sophisticated intrusive cyber technologies and capabilities to non-state threat actors, not bound by rules and norms of state responsibility. Cyber operations through non-state APT actors help maintain plausible deniability. India and Pakistan should refrain from transferring capabilities to non-state APT groups to ensure responsible state behavior and maintain stability. **_Institutionalize attribution:_** To ensure responsible state behavior, both India and Pakistan should consider improving their attribution process. Institutionalizing the process and detailing their evidentiary standards to substantiate the findings will build confidence in their intelligence and threat assessments. Publishing a national attribution policy would explain the objectives behind disclosing a breach or attack, beyond merely aiming for political scoring. Further, both states could also benefit from investing in legal and technical capacity-building for attribution, including in collaboration with private entities and multilateral partnerships. As their decades-long hostilities spill over into cyberspace, there is likely a higher probability of cyber operations increasing in an India-Pakistan context. Realizing the serious implications of cyber threats to strategic stability, Pakistan and India are advised to seriously engage in the measures above that would reduce misperception, increase accountability and transparency, and indicate their commitments to the norms and practices of international law and responsible state behavior during conflict and peace time. _Views expressed are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect the positions of South Asian Voices, the Stimson Center, or our supporters._ Also Read: [Cyber Quicksand?

Defensive capabilities, as the name suggests, are used for building resilience. The aim is to build capacity to protect and respond, minimizing risks and mitigating cyber threats. Offensive capabilities are used to deny, disrupt, and degrade or destroy the adversary’s systems or networks for military or strategic purposes. However, the nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to neatly distinguish between offensive and defensive actions; some activities, like those carried out by security researchers for the purpose of testing for vulnerabilities, could be viewed as an offensive action. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Image 1: [blickpixel via Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/circuit-board-computer-chip-564814/) Image 2: [Great Norwegian Encyclopedia](https://snl.no/Kjernekraft_i_India) Posted in: [Crisis](https://southasianvoices.org/category/crisis/), [Cybersecurity](https://southasianvoices.org/category/cybersecurity/), [Escalation Control](https://southasianvoices.org/category/escalation-control/), [India](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india/), [India-Pakistan Relations](https://southasianvoices.org/category/india-pakistan-relations/), [Pakistan](https://southasianvoices.org/category/pakistan/), [Technology](https://southasianvoices.org/category/technology/) Share this: ## Subscribe to our newsletter Stay informed about the subcontinent.

Of these, only 150 attacks were successful, officials said, as per a report by news agency PTI. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%.In a report titled \"Road of Sindoor\", prepared under the military operation launched by the Indian armed forces under the same name against terrorists, the state's nodal cyber agency has detailed the cyber warfare launched by Pakistan-allied hacking groups. The report has been submitted to all key law enforcement agencies, including the Director General of Police and the State Intelligence Department.According to the report, these cyber attacks originated from Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Middle East, and an Indonesian group, said Yashasvi Yadav, Additional Director General of Police, Maharashtra Cyber. ## India-Pakistan Ceasefire has not stopped Pakistani hackers Even after India and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop military hostilities, Indian government websites are facing a barrage of cyber attacks from the neighbouring country as well as from Bangladesh and the Middle Eastern region, they said.\"The probe discovered that cyber attacks on (government websites in) India decreased after India-Pakistan ceased hostilities, but not fully stopped. These attacks continue from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, and Middle Eastern countries,\" he said.Pakistani hackers bringing down websites of major airports in India, Election Commission and ...Addressing reporters, a senior official of Maharashtra Cyber debunked claims of hackers stealing data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, hacking aviation and municipal systems, and targeting the Election Commission website. ## Techniques used by Pakistani hackers The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported. He said many such attacks were thwarted, and critical infrastructure of India was saved.The report also highlights a hybrid warfare strategy by Pakistan-allied groups that includes widespread misinformation campaigns. These groups falsely claimed to have hacked India's banking system and caused power outages. These false narratives included claims of cyber attacks on India's power grid, statewide blackouts, satellite jamming, disruption of the Northern Command, and an alleged attack on a BrahMos missile storage facility, Yadav said.Maharashtra Cyber identified and removed over 5,000 instances of misinformation and fake news related to India-Pakistan military conflicts that were circulating on social media. ## 7 Pakistani Hacker groups that attacked Indian websites The seven hacking groups identified in the report are APT 36 (Pakistan-based), Pakistan Cyber Force, Team Insane PK, Mysterious Bangladesh, Indo Hacks Sec, Cyber Group HOAX 1337, and National Cyber Crew (Pakistan-allied). These groups collectively launched approximately 1.5 million targeted cyber attacks on Indian infrastructure, Yadav said. ## The Indian websites Pakistani hackers brought down Among the 150 successful attacks, the Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council website was defaced. The attackers also claimed to have stolen data from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), as well as from telecom companies, with some of the data allegedly appearing on the darknet. Additionally, the website of the Defence Nursing College in Jalandhar was defaced. **About the Author** [TOI Tech Desk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-toi-tech-desk-479263800.cms) The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

By [Michael Fisher](https://www.itnews.asia/author/michael-fisher--1955979)on Oct 7, 2025 3:09PM The recent surge in cybersecurity incidents across the Asia Pacific region is now forcing a redefinition of what constitutes \"critical infrastructure.\" While energy grids, transport systems, and healthcare networks remain key targets, the latest attacks in aviation, retail, and financial services show that any network underpinning public safety, economic activity, or essential services can now be considered critical. In Australia, the Qantas breach exposed the personal information of over 5.7 million customers via a third-party system. In Singapore, nation-state actors like UNC3886 have been identified as actively targeting systems tied to national infrastructure. In India, ransomware has brought entire hospital systems and telecom providers to a standstill - disrupting care, communication, and public access. Even Google has now succumbed to a data breach. A growing concern is that this is not limited to large organisations. Cybercriminals are equally targeting small enterprises to gain access to larger corporate systems, as demonstrated by recent breaches of small to mid-size accounting and legal firms. These threats are also no longer confined to traditional IT environments, especially as digital and physical environments continue to converge. Operational Technology (OT) networks that are used to control machinery, industrial processes, and physical infrastructure are increasingly network-connected and vulnerable. Unlike IT systems, OT networks often lack built-in redundancy and can’t tolerate downtime, making them uniquely fragile in the face of modern cyber threats. > #### The increasing and high reliance on digital infrastructure across sectors like banking, retail, and logistics has elevated the criticality of their IT environments. A data centre failure or traffic outage can have the wide-ranging and same societal and economic impact as a disruption to water or energy supply. > > _- Michael Fisher, Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ **The stakes are now higher than ever** As Singapore, India and Australia continue to digitalise core infrastructure and embrace smart systems, ensuring uninterrupted visibility across both IT and OT environments is emerging as a national priority for each country. Whether it’s a power grid in India, a port terminal in Singapore, or an airline in Australia, cyber resilience now depends on having the right architectural foundation – one that offers full visibility, supports zero-trust principles, and maintains uptime across the entire security stack. Governments and enterprises are realising the critical need for better network visibility, security and uptime that spans both digital and operational domains. This is because the next wave of attacks won't distinguish between IT and OT, so Asia Pacific organisations need to ensure their cyber defences are ready. **How can you bridge the IT–OT divide** Many organisations still depend on legacy security tools and operate without full packet visibility or the ability to monitor encrypted traffic. Even inline tools that are used to detect threats can create single points of failure if they’re not architected for continuous uptime. This vulnerability is amplified in OT, where patching or updates may require physical access to remote or sensitive facilities. A way around this lies in adopting highly resilient infrastructure that delivers real-time monitoring with zero disruption. This includes reliable network test access points (TAPs), network packet brokers, and hardware data diodes built for extreme operating conditions, along with inline bypass capabilities that ensure systems remain operational even when security tools fail or require maintenance. A good example of how this works in an organisational context is electrical utilities. As more electricity providers implement cybersecurity solutions inside substations, additional precautions must also be taken to protect infrastructure from sophisticated attacks. To address this, utilities need to look at: - Implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that passively monitors network traffic. - Ensuring that malicious code does not gain access to a substation’s network through the use of cost-effective hardware diodes and data diode TAPs. These provide an additional layer of security before connecting an IDS to a SPAN/Mirror port on a network. For example, a hardware data diode enforces unidirectional data flow so that information flows from sensitive environments, such as critical infrastructure, without the possibility of inbound threats. This one-way communication preserves the integrity of secure zones. There are situations where the use of SPAN/Mirror ports is still needed to connect the IDS to the substation’s network. In these instances, it is best practice to connect a hardware data diode between the SPAN/Mirror port and the IDS to pass the mirrored data onto the IDS sensor. This is because hardware data diodes eliminate bidirectional traffic flow, ensuring that no data is passed back into the Switch’s SPAN/Mirror port. In utilities and other key infrastructure, the use of inline bypass solutions is crucial in enabling organisations to update, test or maintain inline cybersecurity tools without taking them offline and risking exposure to potential cyberattacks. Inline bypass tools are also designed to ensure full network traffic visibility while minimising disruption during system updates and maintenance. With the line between what is and isn’t critical infrastructure continuing to blur, one thing is clear: future-readiness demands full-spectrum visibility, operational uptime, and the resilience to respond to the unexpected. The question that C-level executives of Asia Pacific organisations must now be prepared to answer confidently is whether their IT architecture is resilient enough to withstand a sophisticated cyberattack. _Michael Fisher is the Regional Vice President Asia Pacific and Japan, Garland Technology_ To reach the editorial team on your feedback, story ideas and pitches, contact them [here](mailto:editors@itnews.asia). © iTnews Asia Tags: [garland technology](https://www.itnews.asia/tag/garland-technology) [security](https://www.itnews.asia/security) ### Most Read Articles [**PhilHealth estimates 13 to 20 million members affected by data breach**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/philhealth-estimates-13-to-20-million-members-affected-by-data-breach-601471) [**IMDA and Enterprise Singapore launch SME-focused cybersecurity initiative**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/imda-and-enterprise-singapore-launch-sme-focused-cybersecurity-initiative-620891) [**Indonesia's national data centre suffers ransomware attack**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/indonesias-national-data-centre-suffers-ransomware-attack-609146) [**Ransomware gang Qilin claims attack on Japan’s Asahi breweries**](https://www.itnews.asia/news/ransomware-gang-qilin-claims-attack-on-japans-asahi-breweries-620895)",

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community.

The recent floods across parts of India are the consequence of a wide range of factors, including excessive untimely and prolonged rainfall that occurred, coastal storm surge, water main breaks, dam failures, and more. Flooding results in instant devastation. Floods have the potential to cause significant business disruptions, food shortages, and product shortages. Companies in India have begun acknowledging such natural catastrophic risks to their business; however, concrete efforts are still nascent. Initiatives tend to focus on driving stewardship rather than addressing material risks to operations and value chains. Moreover, very few companies are quantifying their current and future climate risks in financial terms. Floods have caused the most devastation of any of these disasters, notably hitting the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. According to reports, the floods have significantly damaged the area and resulted in an estimated economic loss of between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 crore. The severe damage caused by these floods and previous incidents like the 'Biparjoy' cyclone has raised serious concerns. It emphasises how India is vulnerable to several natural hazards due to its geographic and geographic location. These figures highlight how important catastrophe preparedness is for companies doing business in India. As the country experiences a high frequency of natural disasters, it becomes crucial for businesses to proactively address potential risks and adopt resilient strategies to protect their operations and assets. The effects of natural catastrophes on business operations can be reduced by putting into place comprehensive disaster management plans that include risk assessments, emergency response procedures, and continuity measures. Companies should consider conducting comprehensive risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and develop contingency plans specific to their locations and industry sectors. This will enable them to better understand the potential risks they face and formulate tailored strategies for disaster preparedness and response. With the increasing frequency and severity of floods in our region, it is essential to prioritise disaster recovery planning to protect the business establishment. Floods can have a devastating impact on businesses, causing damage to infrastructure, disrupting operations, and leading to financial losses. By taking proactive measures, we can mitigate risks and enhance resilience. Here is a checklist that outlines some key considerations for businesses: 01. **Risk assessment**: Determines the frequency and severity of natural, man-made and political perils that can affect the organisation and its facilities. By identifying and quantifying these exposures, controls can be implemented to mitigate them as well as provide a cost/ benefit analysis to justify investment in these controls. 02. **Insurance coverage**: Review your insurance policies, particularly your property and business interruption coverage, to ensure they include adequate protection against flood-related damages. Engage with your insurance provider to understand the extent of coverage and any additional options available for flood insurance. 03. **Emergency response plan**: Develop a comprehensive emergency response plan specific to flooding scenarios. Clearly outline roles and responsibilities for your staff during a flood event, establish evacuation procedures, and designate assembly points or safe areas. Regularly review and update this plan as necessary. 04. **Data backup and recovery**: Implement a robust data backup and recovery system to protect your business's critical information. Store backups offsite or in the cloud to ensure accessibility even if your primary systems are compromised during a flood. Test the restoration process periodically to verify its effectiveness. 05. **Physical protection measures**: Take physical measures to safeguard your establishment from flood damage. This may include installing flood barriers or shields, sealing openings vulnerable to water ingress, elevating electrical systems and valuable equipment, and relocating critical utilities to higher levels. 06. **Communication and notification**: Establish reliable communication channels to quickly disseminate information to employees, customers, and suppliers during a flood event. Develop a communication plan that includes alternative means of contact if traditional channels are disrupted. Keep stakeholders informed about any changes in operations or disruptions to services. 07. **Inventory and asset protection**: Regularly maintain an updated inventory of your business assets, including equipment, stock, and supplies. Implement measures to protect inventory from flood damage, such as elevating storage or using waterproof containers. Develop a plan for relocating inventory in case of an impending flood. 08. **Business continuity plan**: Create a business continuity plan that outlines steps to resume operations after a flood. This includes identifying alternative locations or temporary workspaces, establishing communication channels with key stakeholders, and prioritising critical activities to minimise downtime. 09. **Employee safety and support**: Prioritise the safety and wellbeing of employees. Educate them about flood risks and safety protocols, provide training on evacuation procedures, and ensure access to necessary resources, such as emergency supplies and medical assistance. Offer support and resources for employees affected by floods, demonstrating your commitment to their welfare. 10. **Coordination with external agencies**: Coordinate response, continuity and restoration activities with local, regional and national authorities, and with compliance to statutes and regulations. Share best practices, and collectively address challenges. By implementing measures from the checklist, businesses can significantly reduce the impact of natural catastrophic (NatCat) perils and expedite the recovery process. Adaptation and preparedness are key to maintaining continuity, safeguarding assets, and protecting your employees and customers. ### We can help WTW’s Strategic Risk Consulting experts can help mitigate clients total cost of risk (TCOR).

These states also face heightened risks: - **Gujarat:** Prone to floods, tropical cyclones, and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra:** Susceptible to floods and cyclones, especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly impacted by monsoon floods and cyclones, particularly in Chennai. ## **Earthquake Risks** - Urban centres like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** face significant earthquake hazards. - A major earthquake in the **Himalayas** or near urban centres like Mumbai could result in catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the **2001 Bhuj earthquake** in Gujarat. ## **Challenges in Resilience and Insurance** - Despite the scale of economic losses, **underinsurance** remains a critical issue: - **Protection Gaps:** Over **90%** of households and businesses are under- or uninsured, leaving them financially vulnerable. - **Costliest Flood Events:** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of **$5.3 billion** (2024 prices) - **Chennai floods (2015):** Losses of **$6.6 billion** (2024 prices) ## **Building Resilience: A Three-Step Approach** - Swiss Re outlines a strategic framework to address underinsurance and reduce the impact of natural catastrophes: - **Hotspot Identification:** - Identify regions most prone to disasters using granular data. - Prioritize mitigation measures in high-risk areas like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Chennai. - **Risk Assessment:** - Employ advanced models to assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. - Incorporate recent and detailed data for accurate evaluations. - **Reinsurance Solutions:** - Design targeted reinsurance programs to close protection gaps. - Promote affordable insurance coverage for households and businesses. ## **Conclusion** - India's rapid economic growth has outpaced its ability to mitigate the vulnerabilities posed by natural catastrophes. - The increasing frequency of extreme weather events highlights the urgent need for robust disaster preparedness, improved insurance penetration, and strategic resilience-building measures. - By addressing these challenges, India can better safeguard its economy and citizens from the mounting risks of natural disasters. * * * ### **Q1. What is the difference between Floods and Flash Floods?** Flooding is a longer term event than flash flooding: it may last days or weeks. Flash flood: A flood caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time, generally less than 6 hours. ### **Q2. When was NDMA constituted?** In December 2005, the Government of India enacted the Disaster Management Act, which envisaged the creation of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) headed by respective Chief Ministers. **Source :** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/) * * * ​ ​ ​ Submit * * * ![logo](https://www.vajiramandravi.com/_next/static/media/badge_logo.5fb7c7f1.svg) © 2025 Vajiram & Ravi.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

[Sign up](https://subscribe.bylinetimes.com/newsletter-signup/) While the world focuses on the spectacle of India carrying out [its biggest national election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election) – with 960 million Indian citizens eligible to vote out of a population of 1.4 billion – serious unrest continues to haunt the state of Manipur. For the last five months, _Byline Times_ has continued to receive detailed weekly updates from frontline activists in the northeastern state. These catalogue ongoing communal violence between different ethnic and religious groups that is subverting social and political life in the remote region. Building on the conflict recounted in a [previous _Byline Times_ report](https://bylinetimes.com/2023/10/19/state-complicity-and-ethnic-cleansing-in-india/), this unrest has now been taking place for a year. The situation highlights a distinct disconnect between the apparent virtues of India as the world’s largest [democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) and the ongoing restriction of human rights in the country.

These non-Hindu tribal groups include the Kuki, Zomi, Mizo and Chin, which are more widely termed as the [Zo people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo_people). Activists maintain that, courtesy of their links to the ruling state [ministers](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/11/19/amid-the-media-noise-about-cronyism-keir-starmer-is-quietly-reforming-political-standards-for-the-better/) and sympathetic [police](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/11/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-child-abuse-allegations-made-by-victims-are-leading-to-charges/) groupings, the Meitei are being aided by official connivance in their carrying out of “ethnic pogroms”. Zo leaders note their [discrimination](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/09/police-race-action-plan-slammed/) by state officials and processes of “selective justice”, whereby Zo are presented as “anti-nationals” and are much more likely to be prosecuted.

Such accusations come in the midst of continuing violence perpetrated by Meitei tribals and [well-armed militias, such as the Arambai Tenggol](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/explained-who-are-meitei-radical-group-arambai-tenggol-and-why-did-they-summon-manipur-lawmakers) and [Meitei Leepun](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/manipur-violence-it-is-a-global-war-says-meitei-leepun-leader-pramot-singh-interview/article67004485.ece). Such violence includes lynchings, [beheadings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/21/manipur-india-why-is-there-conflict-and-how-is-the-government-responding), torture, abductions, [gang rapes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/22/video-of-women-attacked-in-manipur-breaks-silence-on-systematic-gang-rapes-in-india), bomb attacks, [mob violence](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66086142), booby traps, [public executions](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/09/india-un-experts-alarmed-continuing-abuses-manipur), mutilations, house and [bank robberies](https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/manipur-bank-heist-armed-robbers-loot-over-18-cr-from-punjab-national-bank-branch-in-ukhrul-visuals-surface), vandalism, illegal [tax](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/09/labour-small-business-tax-evasion/) collections, [people being burned alive](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/video-from-manipur-shows-tribal-mans-body-being-burnt-in-a-trench/article67397062.ece), and [the looting and torching of houses and shops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/indian-villages-burned-ethnic-violence). Villages have also faced attacks by [Meitei militias using automatic weapons and mortars](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/violence-continues-in-manipur-mortars-and-automatic-weapons-used/article67253119.ece). Often these incidents have been photographed and filmed, before being shared on social [media](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/10/21/telegraph-misled-readers-on-climate-change-impact-rules-press-watchdog-in-rare-slap-down/) platforms to incite violence and intimidate targeted tribals. This unrest has been intensive and systematic over the last 12 months and by October 2023 more than 70,000 people (including 12,000 children) had been displaced. It has been heightened by [periodic internet bans](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/manipur-violence-internet-services-restored-border-areas-exception-meiteis-kukis-2471548-2023-12-04) and the use of fake news by Meitei media groups, as well as utilising large [protest](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/12/when-peaceful-protesters-face-harsher-sentences-than-violent-racists-something-has-to-give/) mobs to demand the removal of non-Meitei public officials.

This process has included being labelled as refugees, illegal immigrants or [“narco-terrorists”](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/northeast/2023/jul/29/massive-rally-in-manipur-protestors-demand-nrc-action-against-chin-kuki-narco-terrorists-2599921.html), or having links with Myanmar or Bangladesh. Related to these phenomena is the continued religious persecution of the Christian-majority Zo by the Hindu-majority Meitei, which has included [the burning of 357 churches](https://www.opendoors.org.au/frontline-faith/understanding-manipur-what-led-to-the-recent-violence-against-christians-in-india/) since May. Evidence has also surfaced of Zo graves being desecrated. Such claims come despite the existence of regional [Meitei drug gangs](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-violence-poppy-national-security-golden-triangle) and the increased interception by Indian security forces of armed Meitei militia members infiltrating India across the Myanmar border. This discrimination has raised fears that the communal violence aims to force non-Meitei tribals from their land, in order [to monopolise oil, gas and mineral reserves](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/at-the-core-of-manipurs-ethnic-strife-is-fight-over-tribal-land-rights) (such as uranium and platinum). The normalization of violence and population displacement accentuates such a threat. State complicity also plays a role, with Meitei leaders having linkages to big mining corporations eager to exploit such valuable natural commodities. In some areas, power supplies to non-Meitei villages have been sabotaged, leaving them without power or telecommunications for days. Elsewhere, non-Meitei villages have been blockaded by militias, preventing the delivery of essential food and commodities. Signalling a further escalation, in January 2024, [the central Manipur government conceded security control of Imphal to the Arambai Tenggol](https://thediplomat.com/2024/01/abject-surrender-of-the-state-to-armed-militia-in-indias-manipur/). This gave the Meitei militia dominance over security arrangements in Manipur’s capital and – given the militia’s ongoing violence – is an ugly portent for the local non-Meitei population. Meitei legislators were reportedly forced to declare allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol. In the months since the Arambai Tenggol took over, Imphal has seen a rise in armed intimidation, extortion, the illegal occupation of property, and even the [use of improvised explosive devices](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/one-dead-one-injured-blast-indias-manipur-state-2024-02-24/), or IEDs.

Other groups are also recasting the anniversary of the day that Manipur joined the Indian Union on 21 September 1949 as now being a “Black Day” of protest. Additional groups have protested calling for an end to gender-based violence and violence against students. Further collectives are demanding the setting up of an independent Zo administration in Manipur. Coupled with these movements are increasing calls for the Zo areas of Manipur to merge with those in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, especially given the ongoing displacement of the Zo. Within this context, the response by the central government in New Delhi continues to be seen as lax and insufficient. Although the troubles in Manipur are receiving greater national coverage, [Prime Minister Narendra Modi has resisted calls to visit the region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/indian-opposition-walks-out-as-narendra-modi-refuses-to-discuss-manipur-conflict). This comes despite the severe economic and social damage being wrought upon its people, as well as the slow Meitei domination of Manipur’s state bureaucracies. The 2024 [general election](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/08/28/stark-figures-reveal-how-many-londoners-were-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-in-general-election/) may be a factor here, with the BJP seeking to hold the [Inner Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency) (that includes the regional capital Imphal) and possibly gain the [Outer Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency), which it lost to the Naga People’s Front by 73,782 votes in 2019. Moreover, such a blind eye can also potentially be explained by the BJP’s deeper aim to actively assimilate all India’s minorities towards its Hindu majoritarian outlook. Escalating Meitei-instigated violence against Manipur’s tribal groups certainly – and usefully – fits with such a dynamic and appears to be increasingly successful. It also strengthens narratives of India’s Hindu population being threatened by non-Hindus. A BJP victory in the 2024 national [elections](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) will only hasten such a forced “harmonisation”, with negative consequences for other non-Hindu groups, regions, and states across India. * * * ##### Written by [Chris Ogden](https://bylinetimes.com/author/chrisogden/) * * * ##### This article was filed under [Christianity](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/christianity/), [Democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/category/democracy/), [Hinduism](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/hinduism/), [India](https://bylinetimes.com/category/foreign-affairs/india-foreign-affairs/)",

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

Traditionally cooler regions are warming, and winters are becoming more severe”._ He adds: > _“The primary concern posed by climate-related events in our region is the threat to supply chains and loss of premises. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events can disrupt operations, damage infrastructure, and create significant logistical challenges. Additionally, the warming of cooler regions leads to increased use of air conditioning, which contributes to global warming, while the intensification of winters necessitates heating equipment, creating a vicious cycle in the long run.”_ Vaidyanathan reported that business continuity and resilience practitioners in India are exploring how to diversify and decentralise operations to better manage risks and adapt infrastructure to withstand extreme weather. Another avenue is exploring enhanced early warning systems to support timely evacuation and asset protection. However, support from top management is crucial in addressing these concerns effectively, as it is only with adequate support that organizations can implement the necessary measures to build climate resilience and ensure long-term preparedness. This is a change from traditional business continuity management that deals with the effects of disruption in order get back on track with critical activities into a more proactive approach of strategic thinking that modifies organizational structures and adapts infrastructure in advance. However, Vaidyanathan added: > “Currently, there is limited understanding of these concerns, especially in countries like India, where small and medium enterprises (SMEs) significantly contribute to the economy. Their primary focus tends to be business sustainability rather than climate sustainability.” The [BCI Climate Risk Report 2023](https://www.thebci.org/news/new-report-shows-climate-risk-priorities-for-bc-and-resilience-professionals.html) underlines Vaidyanathan’s response. Survey respondents from around the world said that threats related to climate-related events are on the rise. Indeed, 44.4% of respondents stated they had seen a moderate or significant impact from climate related events over the past five years with rainfall and flooding topping the list as their primary climate-related concern. Extreme heat/heatwaves, hurricanes and tornadoes, and wildfires also posed risks, as did the new and rising concern of water scarcity. As a result of increasing climate threats, 47% of respondents highlighted supply chain interruption as their primary concern. Staff absenteeism, loss of premises and power, and revenue dips are also significant potential threats. However, despite these wide-ranging outcomes and the notable rise in events, 22.1% of respondents report their organization has yet to consider climate risk on their risk agenda. To face the rising tide of climate threats, practitioners should seek to align business continuity plans to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) propositions and ensure provision of adequate back-up systems for power and communications. As demonstrated by Cyclone Remal, climate-related events are increasing in ferocity and frequency, and, without any associated legislative regulations to enforce organizational action, ensuring climate risk remains a topic on top management agendas is key to embedding genuine commitment to mitigate climate risk, as well as ensuring a proactive approach is taken. * * * ### Citations \\[1\\][https://climatefactchecks.org/climate-change-leading-to-rise-in-intensity-of-cyclones-along-indias-coastline/](https://climatefactchecks.org/climate-change-leading-to-rise-in-intensity-of-cyclones-along-indias-coastline/) ###### More on -

    "full_text": "# Japan and India seeing highest cybercrime activity in APAC: Microsoft Digital Defense 2025 report _Government agencies and services as well as IT companies are also the sectors most targeted by cyberthreats in 2025._ According to [Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/cybersecurity/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2025/), nation-state threat actors have evolved their cyber and influence operations. Leveraging AI, nation-state actors remain focused on intelligence collection and public perception manipulation, shaping conflict narratives and flooding the information space with synthetic media to desensitize audiences and exhaust detection systems. Amy Hogan-Burney, Corporate Vice President, Customer Security & Trust at Microsoft explained in a [blog post](https://news.microsoft.com/source/emea/2025/10/middle-east-extortion-and-ransomware-drive-over-half-of-cyberattacks/) that “threat actors are using AI to boost their attacks by automating phishing, scaling social engineering, creating synthetic media, finding vulnerabilities faster, and creating malware that can adapt itself. Nation-state actors, too, have continued to incorporate AI in their cyber influence operations. This activity has picked up in the past six months as actors use the technology to make their efforts more advanced, scalable, and targeted.” Looking at cybercrime activity in the region, Japan and India recorded the most cybercrime activity APAC, with the Philippines the most targeted ASEAN nation in 7th place. Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam are also among the top 10 countries in APAC affected by increasing cybercrime. Interestingly, the report revealed cyberattacks remain by and large financially motivated with extortion; ransomware, and data theft are primary attack motivations. Espionage accounts for only 4% of attacks. Government agencies and services as well as IT companies are also the sectors most targeted by cyberthreats in 2025. While espionage only accounted for 4% of cyberattacks, Hogan-Burney pointed out that nation-state actors still target key industries and regions, expanding their focus on espionage, and in some cases on financial gain. She highlighted geopolitical objectives driving a surge in state-sponsored cyber activity, with a notable expansion in targeting communications, research and academia. For example, she stated that China is continuing its broad push across industries to not only conduct espionage and steal sensitive data but have also become faster at operationalizing newly disclosed vulnerabilities. She added that Iran is going after a wider range of targets than ever before, from the Middle East to North America, as part of broadening espionage operations while Russia has expanded targets and North Korea remained focused on revenue generation and espionage. “Amid the growing sophistication of cyber threats, one statistic stands out: more than 97% of identity attacks are password attacks. In the first half of 2025 alone, identity-based attacks surged by 32%. That means the vast majority of malicious sign-in attempts an organization might receive are via large-scale password guessing attempts. Attackers get usernames and passwords (“credentials”) for these bulk attacks by in large from credential leaks,” said Hogan-Burney. She also highlighted the surge in the use of infostealer malware by cybercriminals. Infostealers can secretly gather credentials and information about online accounts like browser session tokens, at scale. Hogan-Burney said cybercriminals can then buy this stolen information on cybercrime forums, making it easy for anyone to access accounts for purposes such as the delivery of ransomware. In mid-2025, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, working with the U.S. Department of Justice, Europol, and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center, carried out a landmark disruption operation against Lumma Stealer, the most prevalent infostealer observed between October 2024 and October 2025. The sophisticated malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform retrieve sensitive data from various browsers and applications, such as cryptocurrency wallets, which is then sold to access brokers through dark web forums and Telegram channels. Over 2,300 malicious domains were seized or blocked, cutting off Lumma’s infrastructure and redirecting infected devices away from criminal control. Despite this, organizations still need to take the highest measures when it comes to their cybersecurity. As cybercriminals are leveraging AI, businesses also need to see how they can best boost their defenses. “Defensive measures alone are not enough to deter nation-state adversaries. Governments must build frameworks that signal credible and proportionate consequences for malicious activity that violate international rules. Encouragingly, governments are increasingly attributing cyberattacks to foreign actors and imposing consequences such as indictments and sanctions. This growing transparency and accountability are important steps toward building collective deterrence. As digital transformation accelerates—amplified by the rise of AI—cyber threats pose risks to economic stability, governance, and personal safety. Addressing these challenges requires not only technical innovation but coordinated societal action,” she concluded.",

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two...",

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Geophysical hazards affect the Himalayan region in the north and northeastern portions of the country where they rank in high deciles for mortality and lower deciles for GDP impact. Cyclones influence a relatively small area of the country but have high-ranking mortality and GDP weighted impacts. Lastly, both the multi-hazard mortality and GDP maps demonstrate that almost the entire country is significantly impacted by at least one hazard and mortality impacts are particularly concentrated in the north and northeastern regions. | | | | © 2005 Center For Hazards and Risk Research at Columbia University | |",

Four of the sites were reportedly located in Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, with the remaining five located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

Some of the most violent attacks conducted by the Naxalites have been against police transport and freight trains, killing dozens of people at a time. The Naxalites specifically inhabit an area known as the \"Red Corridor,\" which stretches from West Bengal state southwest to Karnataka state. The most violent states in this corridor have been Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. The region is defined by rolling hills covered in dense forest and has few improved roads, which allows the Naxalites to control access. The dense foliage also protects them from government aircraft.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "1 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 COUNTRY UPDATE: I UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 October 2024 By Sema Hasan, Senior Policy Analyst Increasing Abuses against Religious Minorities in India Introduction Religious freedom conditions in India have continued to worsen throughout 2024, particularly in the months prior to and immediately following the country’s national elections. In addition to the enforcement of discriminatory state-level legislation and propagation of hateful rhetoric, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government made a concerted effort to implement election promises that negatively and disproportionately impacted religious minorities and their ability to practice their faith. Such promises included enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), inaugurating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and introducing a national code to replace religion-specific personal laws. Each action was justified by government officials as necessary to protect India’s “cultural [and] linguistic heritage”—a common euphemism for Hindu supremacy, often at the expense of religious minorities. This report provides an overview of the various religious freedom violations that have taken place in India during 2024. It focuses on changes to the country’s legal framework, including the strengthening of discriminatory legislation like state-level anti-conversion and anti-terrorism laws, as well as the implementation of the CAA and the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). It also examines the increasing frequency of attacks against religious minorities and their advocates, including the targeting of places of worship. Laws and Other Challenges to Religious Freedom at the National Level The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) In May 2024, the Indian government published the rules for implementing the 2019 Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), fulfilling a long-anticipated BJP campaign promise. Amending the country’s 1955 Citizenship Act, the CAA established a religious criterion for fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants (from Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, or Christian communities) fleeing neighboring Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The law excludes Muslim refugees, including Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Ahmadiyya Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka. The act states that an individual must have lived or worked in India prior to December 31, 2014, in order to apply for citizenship. www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov Stephen Schneck Chair Eric Ueland Vice Chair Commissioners Mohamed Elsanousi Maureen Ferguson Susie Gelman Vicky Hartzler Asif Mahmood Meir Soloveichik Erin D. Singshinsuk Executive Director USCIRF’s Mission To advance international freedom of religion or belief, by independently assessing and unflinchingly confronting threats to this fundamental right. 2 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Critics argue that the CAA violates the Indian constitution’s principles prohibiting religious discrimination and its guarantees of equal protection under the law. Mass protests followed the initial announcement in 2019, in which hundreds were injured and thousands arrested—some of whom remained in detention as of September 2024, including Umar Khalid, Meeran Haider, and Sharjeel Imam. The recent announcement of the implementation rules initiated a surge of new protests as well as a number of petitions challenging the CAA before the Supreme Court. Several Indian states have expressed opposition to the CAA. In 2019, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh all moved resolutions against the CAA. In February 2024, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu stressed that he would not allow implementation of the CAA in that state, as he would “stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan brethren.” Similarly, in March, the chief minister of West Bengal voiced her opposition to the act, arguing that it would be used to “turn legal citizens into foreigners.” Kerala was the first state to legally challenge the CAA and in March renewed its 2020 plea before the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the law’s classification based on religion and country is discriminatory. In June, the Madhya Pradesh government granted Indian citizenship to three applicants under the CAA. National Register of Citizens (NRC) Human rights advocates argue that the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in combination with the CAA, would allow the Indian government to expel those it deemed noncitizens, posing particular risk to the country’s Muslim population. The government first piloted the NRC in Assam in 2018, when it sought to separate Indian citizens from “undocumented immigrants” living in that state. The NRC requires residents to prove they or their ancestors had entered Assam prior to March 24, 1971, or face exclusion from the register. In 2019, the Assam government published its list of names of those it considered Indian citizens according to the NRC, omitting 1.9 million names. Of these 1.9 million, an estimated 700,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Bengali Hindus, and 200,000 were from the Assamese Hindu groups Koch-Rajbongshi, Das, Kalita, and Sarma. In July 2024, the Assam government ordered police to cease referring people entitled to Indian citizenship— under the CAA—to Foreigners’ Tribunals, which function as quasi-judicial bodies that authorities task with determining whether an individual is a “suspected foreigner.” Despite this order, police in Assam that same month, in conjunction with the Foreigners’ Tribunals, declared 28 Muslims as “non-citizens” and sent them to a deportation center. In September, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that all individuals must submit an NRC application in order to receive identity cards. New Delhi India USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 3 Expropriation and Demolition of Places of Worship and Muslim Property Since the beginning of 2024, Indian authorities have facilitated the expropriation of places of worship, including the construction of Hindu temples on the sites of mosques. Most notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in January, fulfilling a key campaign promise. Indian authorities had constructed the temple atop the ruins of the Babri Masjid, which a Hindu mob had demolished in 1992 in their belief that it marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site was long contested; India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the mosque’s destruction was an “egregious violation” of the law and yet granted the site to Hindus while offering Muslims a separate plot of land to construct a new mosque—which remains unbuilt as of September 2024. The days following the temple’s January 2024 consecration were marked by a series of attacks and other instances of intolerance against religious minorities across six states. In each instance, violence erupted following Hindu nationalist processions through predominantly Muslim neighbors. In Maharashtra, violence broke out along Mira Road, where police stood by as mobs vandalized dozens of Muslim-owned shops. Several reports indicate that the police arrested Muslim youths, despite receiving dozens of complaints against the actions of the Hindu mob. In the aftermath of the Mira Road violence, municipal authorities returned with bulldozers to demolish structures they deemed illegal. Commonly referred to as “bulldozer justice,” state authorities have repeatedly used bulldozers to demolish Muslim property under the guise of removing “illegal” structures, including homes, businesses, and places of worship. In February, for example, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) demolished the 600-year-old Akhoondji Mosque, alleging that the building was an illegal encroachment. The mosque’s imam argued that he did not receive written notice before the demolition. The DDA has also announced its intention to demolish 20 religious structures in the forested areas of Sanjay Van, including 16 Muslim shrines. A court order claimed that Delhi “already had sufficient dargahs and temples” and that the forest needed restoration. The same month, in Uttarakhand, the demolition of a mosque and Muslim seminary by police and government officials sparked deadly clashes and an internet shutdown. In July, the DDA demolished the Faizyab Mosque and Madrassa in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area. Places of Worship Act Beyond demolitions, the government has expropriated several mosques for alternative purposes, directly violating India’s Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. The 1991 act froze the status of all religious places of worship as they existed in August 1947 and prohibits their conversion to any other faith. While the act does not apply to the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, it extends protection to all other places of worship. Despite this law, an Indian court ruled in February that Hindus can worship inside the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, which Hindus claim rests on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The same month, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav called for the repeal of the Places of Worship Act, calling it “unconstitutional.” Waqf Amendment Bill In addition, many Muslims have expressed concern regarding the Indian government’s introduction of the Waqf Amendment Bill in August, which seeks to repeal the 1995 Waqf Act. A waqf is an endowment (movable or immovable) that Muslims can give for a specific pious or charitable purpose, according to Islamic tradition. Once registered as a waqf, such property—which may include land, graveyards, or buildings—is deemed nontransferable and held in perpetuity as such. All mosques in India are considered waqf properties, under the management of Muslim bodies in every state, known as Waqf Boards. The 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to broaden the government’s regulatory authority over these endowments and proposes the mandatory inclusion of non-Muslim members on Waqf Boards. It also seeks to prohibit the designation of a given property as a waqf based on its owner’s oral declaration alone. Legal experts and Muslim leaders argue that these provisions would erode their community’s autonomy over its own religious institutions. The introduction of this legislation follows the increased proliferation of disinformation regarding the distribution of wealth among India’s Muslim communities, including derogatory comments that Prime Minister Modi made during the national election. 4 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 State and Local Laws Impacting Religious Minorities Uniform Civil Code and Personal Status Laws Since 2019, Prime Minister Modi and the BJP have articulated their intention to implement a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to overrule existing personal laws that are highly integrated with religious beliefs. Such personal laws include areas such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and succession. Critics argue that a UCC would contradict secular principles while failing to adequately represent the needs and values of the country’s myriad and diverse religious communities. In February, the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand passed a state-level UCC bill, establishing a uniform set of rules on personal status law that includes marriage, divorce, succession, and inheritance. This bill is widely considered to represent a template for other states to adopt. The UCC sets the minimum age for marriage at 18. While Hindu and secular laws set age restrictions for men and women, there are no such limitations for Muslims and other communities. Some Muslim communities have characterized the UCC as a threat to Islamic practices, preferring to observe Shari’a as the basis for personal law, and some Sikh organizations have similarly rejected it, arguing that it “undermines Sikh identity.” The UCC further requires “live-in” relationships to be registered within a month and establishes criminal punishments, including six months in jail, for failing to do so. Such provisions would allow for further policing of interfaith couples, who already face risks including threats of violence from family members. In July, for example, the Uttarakhand high court directed police to provide protection to an interfaith couple in a live-in relationship and instructed them to register under the UCC. The couple reported receiving threats from their parents about their relationship. Anti-Conversion Laws In addition to the UCC and other legislation, authorities frequently used state-level policies throughout the first part of 2024, including anti-conversion laws, to target religious minorities across India. As USCIRF previously reported, 12 of India’s 28 states currently maintain anti\u0002conversion laws and enforce them to varying degrees. These laws prohibit conversion under circumstances that far exceed cases of coercion, and they are often punishable by hefty fines and prison terms. Authorities frequently enforce such laws under the pretext of preventing so-called “love jihad”—a conspiracy theory that claims Muslim men target and seduce Hindu women for conversion to Islam—while in effect targeting interfaith relationships. Since the beginning of the year, authorities have arrested dozens of Christians on allegations of conducting or participating in forced conversions. In June, for example, police in Uttar Pradesh detained 13 Christians, including four pastors; in July, seven Christians faced accusations of violating the state’s anti-conversion law in two separate incidents. That same month, government officials from Uttar Pradesh tabled a bill that would strengthen the state’s anti-conversion law, including expanding the punishment for conversion to life imprisonment, allowing anyone to file a First Instance Report (FIR) against suspected violators, and making religious conversion a nonbailable offense. Several other states made similar efforts to introduce or strengthen existing anti-conversion laws. In February, for example, the state of Chhattisgarh announced it would introduce legislation to address “illegal conversion,” claiming that Christian pastors had forcibly converted Hindus. In February, the Assam government passed the Assam Healing (Prevention of Evil) Practices Bill, which bans individuals or groups from performing “non\u0002scientific” healing, such as prayer, to treat illnesses. The chief minister of Assam further noted his intention to restrict Christian evangelism and conversion in the state with the bill. In April, the government of Gujarat issued a circular mandating that Hindus wishing to convert to Buddhism, Sikhism, or Jainism obtain approval from their district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. In June, the BJP-led government in Rajasthan withdrew its 2008 anti-conversion law in favor of new legislation aimed at “curbing alleged cases of ‘love jihad’” and religious conversion. Additionally, as of August, appeals challenging the constitutionality of anti\u0002conversion laws were pending in seven states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Anti-Cow Slaughter Laws India’s constitution directs states to take steps to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, considered sacred in Hinduism. As a result, 20 of India’s 28 states currently enforce anti-cow slaughter laws. Vigilante groups and self-proclaimed “cow protectors” frequently exploit such laws to target religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits. USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 5 An estimated dozen attacks involving “cow vigilantism” took place following India’s national elections in June. In August, for example, a group of cow vigilantes beat a Muslim migrant worker to death, falsely accusing him of having eaten beef. A day later, a group of Hindu men violently attacked a 72-year-old Muslim man because they believed he was carrying beef in his bag. The same month, a group of “cow protectors” shot and killed a 19-year-old Hindu student because they thought he was a Muslim smuggling cows. While arrests were made in each of these cases, perpetrators of such attacks often operate with impunity; they rarely face punishment and are often released on bail within 24 hours. Other Significant Religious Freedom Challenges across India Hate Speech, Misinformation and Disinformation In the leadup to the June 2024 elections, political officials increasingly wielded hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims and other religious minorities. Prime Minister Modi repeatedly claimed that the opposition party would “wipe out [the] Hindu faith from the country” and had plans to make Hindus “second class citizens in their own country.” He perpetuated hateful stereotypes about Muslims, referring to them as “infiltrators.” Union Home Minister Amit Shah echoed these statements and insisted falsely that opposition leaders would impose Shari’a if elected—despite the fact that the opposition election manifesto included no mention of Shari’a or Muslims. Additionally, misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech by Indian government officials frequently fuel and incite cow vigilantism and other attacks against religious minorities. The attacks against Muslims in Mira Road following the inauguration of the Ram Temple in January, for example, erupted following inflammatory speeches by two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain. Rane reportedly openly threatened the Muslim community, using offensive language and urging the Hindu community to “ignite and retaliate.” While First Instance Reports (FIRs) were filed against Rane and Jain, Mumbai police argued in July that the use of terms like “jihadis,” “Rohingya,” and “Bangladeshis” were not aimed at the Muslim community and therefore did not fall under Section 295A of the penal code. The same month, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD) expressed concern about an increase in hate speech targeting Rohingya refugees and the Indian government’s role in arbitrary mass detention and forcible return of that community to Burma. Following Rane and Jain’s speeches, BJP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) T. Raja Singh gave a 40-minute speech in February stoking religious tensions, in which he openly called for violence against Muslims and for the further demolition of mosques in Kashi and Mathura. Singh claimed that Muslims were facilitating the forceful conversion of Hindus and repeatedly referred to Rohingya and Bangladeshi Muslims as “illegal.” He encouraged his audience to be “prepared to fight for the protection of our country and religion” and to fight against “love jihad,” forced conversion, and cow slaughter. Attacks against Religious Minorities In March, a group of UN experts raised alarm about the level of violence and hate crimes against religious minorities in the leadup to national elections, including vigilante violence, targeted and arbitrary killings, demolition of property, and harassment. They called on the Indian government to fulfill its obligation to prohibit religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and violence. From January to March 161 incidents of violence against Christians in India were reported—47 of which occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh. Such incidents ranged from violent attacks on churches and prayer meetings to physical assaults, harassment, and false allegations of forced conversion. Muslims continued to be targeted, as well. In March, a group of Hindus in Gujarat violently attacked foreign Muslim university students as they gathered for prayer during Ramadan. The university subsequently issued new guidelines, instructing students not to pray in common spaces. Moreover, following the election results, during which the BJP lost its national majority, at least 28 attacks against Muslims occurred from June to August. Religious educational institutions were also subjected to harassment and targeting. In February, for example, Hindu organizations entered a Catholic school in Assam and demanded instructors cease using Christian images and symbols. In March, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment striking down a previous ruling on the governance of madrasas, effectively banning Islamic schools in that state and ordering the public school enrollment of students whom the closures had impacted. 6 USCIRF Country Update: India | October 2024 Crackdown on Civil Society and Faith-Based Organizations In 2024 the government of India has expanded its tactics of repression to target religious minorities and their advocates abroad. Journalists, academics, and civil society organizations documenting India’s religious freedom violations have reported facing denial of consular services, including the revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards as well as threats of violence and surveillance. In April, international reporting linked an official in India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to the 2023 assassination attempt of an American Sikh activist in New York. Additionally, Indian authorities have repeatedly used discriminatory legislation to target religious communities and those advocating on their behalf. Authorities continued to exploit antiterror and financing laws, including the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), to crack down on civil society organizations, religious minorities, human rights defenders, and journalists reporting on religious freedom. The UAPA was enacted in 1967 but amended in 2019, allowing the government to designate individuals as “terrorists” without due process. The law vaguely defines “unlawful activity” as any action “intended to disrupt India’s sovereignty, integrity or security,” including “disruptive speech.” In 2024, several religious minorities and human rights activists have continued to face detention without trial under the UAPA, including Hany Babu and Rona Wilson. Academic and human rights activist GN Saibaba, whom authorities detained under the UAPA in 2017 for criticizing state violence against religious minorities, was ultimately released in March but described how police had abused him, tortured him, and denied him medical care while in custody. Similarly, organizations that document and advocate for religious freedom continue to face harassment and, in some cases, are forced to shut down operations. Like the UAPA, authorities have used India’s Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to obstruct the work of civil society organizations. FCRA regulates access to foreign funds for individuals and organizations and prohibits receipt of foreign funds for “any activities [deemed] detrimental to the national interest” of India. The law requires nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to apply for FCRA licenses to received foreign funding, but authorities can readily revoke such licenses. In April, India’s Home Ministry canceled the FCRA licenses of five NGOs, preventing them from using existing funds. Those NGOs included the Church of North India (CNI) Synodical Board of Social Service, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, and Evangelical Fellowship of India. In total, the Indian government has canceled over 20,000 FCRA registrations since 2012. Replacing India’s Criminal Code In July, the Indian government moved to replace its colonial-era criminal laws with three new laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA). These laws replaced the 1860 Indian Penal Code, the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, and the 1872 Indian Evidence Act, respectively. Human rights groups argue that the enforcement of these new laws may have exacerbated the targeting of religious minorities and their advocates. Such legislation may pose an additional threat to freedom of expression, association, and right to a free trial, particularly for religious minorities. The BNS specifically adds a new provision criminalizing “acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India” and increases the minimum punishment from three years to seven. It also expands the criminalization of the promotion of “enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion” to include electronic communications. Reporting indicates that this provision has already served as a pretext for targeting journalists who reported on an alleged mob lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh. The BNSS additionally allows for police to seek 15-day detention of an accused individual at any time before they have completed 40–60 days of the allowed remand period. UNITED STATES COMMISSION on INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 732 N. Capitol Street, NW, Suite #A714 Washington, DC 20401 202-523-3240 www.USCIRF.gov @USCIRF Media@USCIRF.gov The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is an independent, bipartisan federal government entity established by the U.S. Congress to monitor, analyze, and report on religious freedom abroad. USCIRF makes foreign policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress intended to deter religious persecution and promote freedom of religion and belief. Professional Staff Michael Ardovino Policy Analyst Susan Bishai Senior Policy Analyst Mollie Blum Policy Analyst Guillermo Cantor Director of Research and Policy Elizabeth K. Cassidy Senior Strategic Advisor Mingzhi Chen Supervisory Policy Advisor Patrick Greenwalt Policy Analyst Sema Hasan Senior Policy Analyst Thomas Kraemer Chief Administrative Officer Veronica McCarthy Public Affairs Associate Hilary Miller Policy Analyst Nora Morton Operations Specialist Dylan Schexnaydre Policy Analyst Scott Weiner Supervisory Policy Analyst Luke Wilson International Legal Specialist Kurt Werthmuller Deputy Director of Research and Policy Nathan Wineinger Chief of Public Affairs Jean Wu Policy Analyst Conclusion Religious freedom conditions in India continue to follow a deteriorating and concerning trajectory. The Indian government continues to repress and restrict religious communities through the enforcement of discriminatory legislation like anti-conversion laws, cow slaughter laws, and antiterrorism laws. In doing so, authorities have arbitrarily detained individuals highlighting violations of religious freedom, including religious leaders, journalists, and human rights activists, without due process—in some cases for years. Indian officials have repeatedly employed hateful and derogatory rhetoric and misinformation to perpetuate false narratives about religious minorities, inciting widespread violence, lynchings, and demolition of places of worship. In its 2024 Annual Report, USCIRF recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a Country of Particular Concern for engaging in particularly severe religious freedom violations. This report further outlines a number of policy recommendations that the U.S. government can take to address religious freedom violations in India, including issuing targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, conditioning arms sales based on improved religious freedom conditions, and incorporating religious freedom priorities into bilateral meetings with Indian government counterparts.",

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

Following years of gradual infrastructure development, including military infrastructure, by both China and India, China has now closed the gap that existed between the two sides along most locations on the border. **Subscribe to the Stratfor Podcast wherever you listen, including:** **[Apple Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/stratfor-talks/id1022071615?mt=2) [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL3N0cmF0Zm9yLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz&ved=2ahUKEwjxt7jDk4fqAhWChXIEHbgRDaYQ4aUDegQIARAC) [Castbox](https://castbox.fm/channel/id1060917?skip=0&limit=147&country=us) [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stratfor-talks) [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/511PM9A2TFTGtdCwg1qQ5C?si=XsfDXTEORUOKTQSvos3T9w)** **Suggested Reading from Stratfor Worldview** [The Nature of China's Military Push Along the Indian Border](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/nature-chinas-military-push-along-indian-border) [What the Closure of a Consulate Could Mean for U.S.-China Tensions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/what-closure-consulate-could-mean-us-china-tensions) ## RANE and Stratfor Connect Risk and Security Professionals to Critical Insights and Expertise RANE helps security professionals meet their risk management challenges with access to the latest risk intelligence and world-class expertise, combining top tier in-house subject matter experts with our prescreened network of risk management professionals and service providers to help clients prepare for and respond to a full range of safety and security issues.

    "full_text": "Results from India's general election indicate that the ruling party will return to office but will need to work with coalition partners, which will likely still result in broad domestic economic policy continuity, but will probably also introduce intra-coalition splits on major reforms and controversial social measures that generate some policymaking slowdowns and potential uncertainty. As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

    "full_text": "Bangladesh will likely adopt a more assertive foreign policy, which will likely include strengthening ties with Pakistan while balancing its economic dependencies on India and maintaining cooperation on security and regional stability. On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(VYACHESLAV OSELEDKO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Central Asia has restructured its economic links over the past decade, as China has outpaced Russia in the region on trade, investment and infrastructure development._ - _Russia maintains its influence in Central Asia, however, and China so far has been careful to make sure its economic initiatives in the region largely complement Moscow's interests._ - _While China and Russia have worked to mitigate potential differences in Central Asia, several factors potentially could cause problems between Moscow and Beijing in the years to come._ Central Asia has undergone a significant economic transformation in recent years as trade and investment in the region have shifted away from Russia and toward China. Russia remains a major economic force in Central Asia, and China's rise in the region complements its interests in many ways -- or at least doesn't directly contradict them. But Central Asia's growing economic dependence on China and Beijing's increasing political and security influence in the region could foster increased tensions between the two powers....

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

These constraints limit the pace at which new capacity can be brought online. India’s transition to renewables is limited by the mismatch between variable generation and grid consumption. While solar generation aligns with the afternoon peak consumption pattern, it tapers off in the evening when demand is high. This creates a gap that limits renewable integration and leads to the underutilisation of transmission corridors. Energy storage is vital to bridge this gap. Renewable corridors often operate below their intended capacity; however, some degree of underutilisation is temporary, as it reflects strategic overbuilding to meet future demand growth. Transmission planning needs to move beyond the traditional five-year static cycle to a more adaptive approach that reflects evolving generation patterns and demand growth. India’s power transmission network, one of the largest in the world, spans over 494,000 circuit kilometres (ckm) of lines and 1.33 million megavolt-amperes of transformation capacity, forming a fully synchronised national grid. However, the network struggles to keep up with renewable energy deployment, leading to a growing gap between clean power generation and the availability of evacuation infrastructure. This imbalance limits renewable integration and increases the risk of stranded assets and higher delivery costs. The widening gap between planned and actual transmission network expansion is becoming evident. In FY2025, only 8,830ckm of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253ckm, reflecting a 42% shortfall, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade. Alongside this capacity gap, system inefficiencies are emerging, with analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicating that up to 71% of ISTS corridors operate below 30% utilisation, underscoring the mismatch between infrastructure availability and actual power flows. Market distortions further aggravate the situation. In several high-demand corridors, speculative hoarding of transmission capacity by entities without genuine project intent has driven up connectivity prices and delayed access for viable projects. Structural and procedural bottlenecks, including right-of-way (RoW) disputes, prolonged land acquisition processes, restrictions on equipment procurement, and multi-agency approval requirements, add to the delay. Among these, RoW remains one of the most significant barriers to timely transmission development. Similar land acquisition hurdles in the US have also slowed new transmission build-outs. In India, the impact is most visible in Rajasthan, where 8 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity remains stranded, with nearly half curtailed during peak solar hours. Delayed completion of the Associated Transmission System—the dedicated transmission infrastructure linked to new generation projects—along with capacity hoarding and ecological directives mandating underground cabling in Great Indian Bustard habitats, have compounded evacuation challenges, inflated project costs, and reduced operational efficiency. The implications are significant—over 50GW of renewable energy capacity is currently stranded nationwide, increasing per-unit transmission costs, weakening project viability, and deterring private investment. These constraints limit the pace at which new capacity can be brought online and undermine India’s ability to integrate variable renewable energy at scale, risking missed milestones in the country’s clean energy transition. A unified generation-transmission planning framework that aligns timelines and locations for both generation and transmission capacity additions is essential. A single-window clearance system with strict timelines should be implemented to streamline land, RoW, and connectivity approvals. Performance-based incentives and disincentives tied to asset utilisation metrics can encourage timely commissioning and sustained operations. Scaling asset monetisation and public-private partnerships will be essential to unlocking capital for both inter-state and intra-state projects. In parallel, reconductoring of congested corridors and integration of energy storage systems should be prioritised in renewable-rich regions to enhance capacity utilisation and reduce curtailment. A coordinated approach—combining regulatory reform, operational efficiency measures, and capital mobilisation—will be critical to transforming India’s transmission network into a flexible, resilient system capable of supporting high renewable penetration while ensuring cost-effective and reliable power delivery. The recent extension of ISTS charge waivers for storage and the implementation of time block-based General Network Access allocation—which allows power generators to use the transmission network without pre-identifying buyers—are steps in the right direction. Without targeted reforms, misalignment between generation commissioning and evacuation infrastructure is likely to continue driving congestion, curtailment, and systemic inefficiencies, ultimately slowing progress towards achieving India’s decarbonisation objectives. ### Vibhuti Garg Vibhuti Garg is the Director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), where she leads efforts to advance sustainable development through strategic policy interventions in energy pricing, subsidy reforms, innovative business models, and market design.

REUTERS/Amit Dave//File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Companies NEW DELHI, Oct 6 (Reuters) - India's federal power regulator has admitted petitions filed by two renewable energy developers seeking compensation for financial losses incurred due to delays in setting up transmission infrastructure, according to regulatory filings. The outcome could set a precedent for renewable energy developers facing transmission bottlenecks, as India accelerates its clean energy rollout. Sign up here. In the filing posted over the weekend, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is examining whether the Power Grid Corporation of India (PGRD.NS), opens new tab and the Central Transmission Utility of India, the institutions responsible for setting up transmission infrastructure, should compensate developers for losses. CERC has asked both to respond within six weeks. The developers, ACME Solar (ACMO.NS), opens new tab and AMPIN Energy, argued in separate petitions that they suffered financial losses due to their inability to transmit power from their solar projects due to delays in operationalising transmission infrastructure. The Gurugram-based ACME Solar is seeking more than 210 million rupees in compensation, while AMPIN Energy did not specify its losses. CERC has directed the Central Transmission Utility and Power Grid to submit details on the transmission system, commissioning timelines, and reasons for the delays. The petitions are scheduled to be heard on November 27. Power Grid and the Central Transmission Utility did not immediately respond to Reuters' email seeking comments. India has been forced to curb solar output during periods of low demand to maintain grid stability and ease congestion, as renewable energy supply rises and transmission projects lag. Rajasthan, India’s top green power-producing state, has seen nearly 4 gigawatts of clean energy curtailed, with estimated losses of up to 2.5 billion rupees ($28.16 million), according to the Rajasthan Solar Association.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances.

In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact. With the United States demanding that India reduce its bilateral trade surplus, open its economy to more U.S. agricultural products and go easier on U.S. technology giants, the countries remain far apart on a longer-term deal....

India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...
