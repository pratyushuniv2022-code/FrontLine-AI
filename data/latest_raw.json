The four states most likely to be affected by increasing global temperatures are Ban\u0002gladesh, India, Myanmar, and Thailand. In order to prepare for and mitigate the potentially destabilizing effects of climate change, poli\u0002cymakers should understand the most plausible scenarios for climate change and conflict in the region. Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Thailand are among the world’s top ten states most vulnerable to natural disasters, while India is the largest power in the region and is itself highly climate vulnerable.1 Historically, those four states have faced many of the world’s deadli\u0002est cyclones. Climate change increases the damage caused by cyclones, as warmer temperatures enable storms to hold more moisture. Rainfall variabil\u0002ity—and the resulting flash floods—as well as rising sea levels con\u0002tribute to routine flooding, which is especially dangerous for coastal communities. Some of these at-risk coastal areas encompass major, densely populated cities such as Chennai, India; Kolkata, India; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Yangon, Myanmar; and Bangkok, Thailand. Drought and soil deterioration are increasingly leading to food security concerns in Bangladesh, peninsular India, and Thailand, all of which rely on grow\u0002ing rice. Over the next three decades, deadly heat stress conditions are also likely to become more common.2 The Bangladesh-Myanmar-North Eastern India corridor is the part of the region most prone to climate-magnified conflict and instability. The likeliest climate-related paths to increased conflict and chaos are INTRODUCTION 2 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region through intensifying natural hazards (particularly cyclones and floods) and the securitization of climate-influenced migration. Though they face many common climate challenges, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Thailand have varying levels of state capacity for disaster relief and human security promotion, with Thailand and India best equipped and Myanmar, wracked by internal instability, the most vulnerable. The Bay of Bengal is also a zone of maritime security and economic competition between the United States and China. India has emerged as a security partner of the United States in recent years largely due to their common rivalry with China. Other geopolitical tensions have increased within the region of late, especially between Myanmar and Bangladesh. A combination of quantitative and qualitative sources—including conflict and climate vulnerability data, media and scholarly literature, and twenty-two interviews with senior academics, think-tank analysts, and climate and security practitioners and analysts—informed the analysis that follows. Four adverse scenarios focused on Bangladesh, Myanmar, and the region as a whole are outlined to enable policymak\u0002ers to tailor capacities and responses.3 Policymakers at the regional and global levels should emphasize cooperative policy approaches to improve resilience, disaster relief capacities, and preventive climate security diplomacy with regional institutions and states. 3 While there is not necessarily a direct causal relationship between cli\u0002mate change and armed conflicts or instances of political instability, under certain conditions, the effects of climate change can cause exist\u0002ing social and economic fault lines to widen, increasing the potential for conflict.4 Literature on climate vulnerability focused on domestic insta\u0002bility and interstate rivalries in the Bay of Bengal region is not extensive, though some studies draw connections between climate change and var\u0002ious conflicts in South and Southeast Asia, including India-China ten\u0002sions, the India-Pakistan conflict, and water disputes.5 Migration related to climate hazards in the Bay of Bengal region has, however, drawn sig\u0002nificant international attention.6 The focus on migration is also due to previously overstated concerns about climate change as a primary driver of Bangladeshi emigration.7 In fact, migration has multiple causes, and climate change tends to play a partial and indirect role.8 Thus, the “envi\u0002ronmental determinism” model of citing climate change as a predomi\u0002nant and current driver of migration is too simplistic.9 However, in the event of a 1.5–2˚C (2.7–3.6˚F) increase in average global temperatures, climate change could well become a first-order driver of migration flows, especially from low-lying states and regions. Climate change in the Bay of Bengal can be most accurately under\u0002stood as a threat multiplier, typically magnifying existing risks of insta\u0002bility and conflict.10 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate change risk as the likelihood of hazards (includ\u0002ing shocks such as cyclones as well as gradual environmental trends) multiplied by the potential effects of those hazards on the physical and human assets in the surrounding area (known as the exposure of a region).11 A community’s climate vulnerability is defined by its “pro\u0002pensity or predisposition to be adversely affected” by hazards.12 When CLIMATE CHANGE AND INSECURITY IN THE REGION Climate Change and Insecurity in the Region 4 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region Bay of Bengal Countries Differ in Economy Size, Wealth Figure 1 Source: World Bank. $0 $1T $2T $3T Gross domestic product, 2021 IndiaThailand Bangladesh Myanmar $0 $2K $4K $6K Gross domestic product per capita, 2021 IndiaThailandBangladeshMyanmar major climate hazards combine with high exposure and high vulnera\u0002bility in the absence of strong institutions and societal harmony, seri\u0002ous security challenges could arise. The Bay of Bengal region faces major challenges from climate change including intensifying cyclones, rising sea levels, flooding, drought, and extreme heat. Even at a 1.5˚C temperature rise, deadly heat stress condi\u0002tions are expected to become more common.13 Drought is also a concern, especially as most of the population that lives in the Bay of Bengal’s lit\u0002toral zones is engaged in agriculture. Rice-growing regions—especially in Thailand, Bangladesh, and peninsular India—could be significantly affected by drought or soil deterioration. Climate change is causing increased rainfall variability, which is a major cause of flooding and flash flooding. Rising sea levels threaten the cities of Chennai, Kolkata, Dhaka, Yangon, and Bangkok. Preventing the emergence of security challenges due to climate change should involve early action on adaptation among vulnerable communities, other disaster risk management (DRM) mea\u0002sures, and the adequate provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) in the aftermath of natural disasters. While Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Thailand are all exposed to substantial climate hazards, they have entirely different levels of economic development (see figure 1). India’s absolute gross domestic 5 product (GDP) is by far the largest, but in terms of GDP per capita—a metric which can be inversely related to climate vulnerability—Thailand is the most advanced. Bangladesh has recently made remarkable progress to slightly overtake India in GDP per capita. All four countries lie within the “warning” to “alert” range in the Fragile States Index, indicating seri\u0002ous governance and stability problems. Each also has a different local context and, thus, different adaptation needs.14 In the case of Myanmar, ongoing internal instability following a February 2021 military coup has greatly increased state fragility and put the country at a higher risk of cli\u0002mate change-related insecurity. Bay of Bengal states have significantly improved their disaster response systems over the past two decades, but still suffer from major institutional deficits. As the world heads toward a 1.5–2˚C climb in the global average temperature, the incidence of climate hazards will multiply and their entanglement with conflict will become much more significant. The lit\u0002toral regions of the Bay of Bengal are among the most at risk in South and Southeast Asia when it comes to climate change.15 Therefore, it is worth analyzing the specific link between climate vulnerability and the region’s security. BANGLADESH A population of more than 160 million, limited state capacity, and flat, low-lying topography make Bangladesh uniquely vulnerable to the worst security outcomes of climate change. The landscape of Bangla\u0002desh is dominated by the world’s largest river delta, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers converge. Its coast has historically been a major site of deadly cyclones.16 Examples include the Bhola and 2B cyclones of 1970 and 1991, respectively, which killed between 300,000 and 500,000 Bangladeshis.17 Bangladesh is the site of two\u0002fifths of the world’s storm surges, and sea level rise (SLR) significantly amplifies the destructiveness of floods. Drought is a concern in the west and northwest of the country, and salinity ingress—the encroachment of saltwater into the freshwater supply—is a challenge in the country’s southwest.18 Climate vulnerability in Bangladesh is generally high across the country, but is particularly high on the shores of its three main rivers, in the coastal south, its southeast (Chittagong district), and the northeastern district of Sylhet (see figure 2).19 The impoverished communities who live on the sandbars, or “chars,” on Bangladesh’s major rivers are especially vulnerable. They live under the threat of sea\u0002sonal floods that can wash away their homes.20 Climate Change and Insecurity in the Region 6 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region In contrast to Myanmar, the Bangladeshi economy has grown rap\u0002idly in recent years due to strong export and manufacturing perfor\u0002mance, mainly in textiles. It has recently overtaken India in terms of per capita GDP and is also only slightly behind India in terms of human development indicators (see figure 1).21 The 2017 Rohingya expulsion crisis in Myanmar, resulting in a flow of refugees into Bangladesh, created a major challenge for the country’s disaster relief capabilities. Nevertheless, Bangladesh has evolved sub\u0002stantial capacities and plans for responding to complex emergencies, leading to a massive reduction in the loss of life in the wake of natural disasters.22 For instance, the category four Cyclone Sidr in 2007 led to a Political Violence and Climate Vulnerability in Bangladesh Figure 2 Sources: Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project; Azam et al., “Identification of Climate Change Vulnerable Zones in Bangladesh Through Multivariate Geospatial Analysis.” 0 100 km 0 100 mi Dhaka Dhaka Climate vulnerability score from Azam et al.

Political violence occurs in all parts of the country. 7 loss of 3,406 lives, in contrast to the hundreds of thousands lost during a weaker storm in 1970.23 This amounts to a more than one-hundred\u0002fold improvement.24 The aftermaths of more recent storms with similar intensity to Sidr show a further dramatic decline in casualties.25 Policy actions taken by the state have given rise to substantive increases in the country’s resilience to natural hazards, though the presence of inter\u0002national nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) has been a signifi\u0002cant help.26 Bangladesh has achieved remarkable progress by investing a total of $10 billion into the operations of small cyclone shelters, the construction of coastal embankments called polders, the cultivation of saltwater-resistant rice variants, attempts to reduce saltwater intrusion, reforestation schemes, early warning and communication systems, and evacuation plans.27 The government also released a strategy on man\u0002aging internal displacement in 2021.28 Global climate experts such as Bangladesh-based Saleemul Huq are also pushing for adaptation fund\u0002ing and loss and damage accountability from wealthier states.29 Despite these major advances, Bangladesh’s institutions still struggle to effec\u0002tively implement disaster relief plans.30 Bangladesh is not facing a major insurgency, though the region surrounding the capital of Dhaka, as well as some southern and east\u0002ern regions proximate to Myanmar’s Rakhine state, faces significant political violence. Violence between the country’s nationalist Muslim and secular political parties and intercommunal clashes are of primary concern. As sea level rise and seawater ingress increase, significantly more Bangladeshis will become displaced from coastal regions and the areas surrounding the country’s “megadeltas.”31 Their migration inland is likely to trigger communal violence and land disputes in the southeast and boost recruitment of new migrants into drug traffick\u0002ing gangs.32 Bangladeshi migration is overwhelmingly internal; most migrants move to various district capitals or to the country’s two major cities, Dhaka and Chittagong, rather than abroad.33 Migration to India, which was substantial in the 1990s, has become less com\u0002pelling to Bangladeshis due to economic growth at home over the past two decades. Indian border fencing also serves as a deterrent for migration to India.34 As slow-onset sea level rise and salinity ingress increase, more citizens will migrate from coastal regions and regions surrounding the country’s especially threatened megadeltas due to a combination of factors.35 While estimates of climate-related emigration from Bangla\u0002desh are difficult to calculate and often overstated, some estimates put the number as high as ten to twenty-six million by 2050.36 More Climate Change and Insecurity in the Region 8 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region conservative estimates still anticipate 3.6 to 13.3 million emigrants.37 Should climate-magnified security concerns proliferate in Bangladesh, conflict would most likely occur in the country’s southeast, adjacent to Myanmar’s Rakhine state, and in the east and northeast, in regions bor\u0002dering India. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myan\u0002mar, currently housed in camps in the southeast of Bangladesh, are also highly vulnerable to climate hazards, even as they are increasingly vic\u0002tims of internecine violence between militant groups.38 INDIA India comprises a vast diversity of geographies, ethnicities, religions, and economies. It is by far the largest of the four Bay of Bengal countries with a population of over 1.4 billion, which became the world’s largest in 2022.39 Poor disaster planning in the region exacerbates its vulner\u0002ability to major weather events, as was revealed when recovery efforts failed to effectively reach some people affected by major floods in 2015 in Chennai.40 India is a lower middle-income country with living standards well below those of Thailand but greater than those of Myanmar (see figure 1). Its North Eastern Region is economically disadvantaged, while the pen\u0002insular states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are relatively prosper\u0002ous, with generally higher human development levels and capable state and local governments. India faces multiple risks due to climate change including drought, floods, intense rainfall, cyclones, and sea level rise. Rural distress, increased stresses on India’s delicately balanced fed\u0002eral structure, and urban and intercommunal violence are the poten\u0002tial flashpoints with the greatest security implications; all are at risk of magnification due to climate change. Climate pathways leading to those security challenges include greater agricultural distress, inter\u0002state migration, water disputes between riparian states, natural haz\u0002ards, and violence magnified by extreme heat waves.41 A major Indian river that flows into the Bay of Bengal, the Brahmaputra, originates in Tibet, China, and is the site of a growing transboundary water dispute between New Delhi and Beijing.42 The Brahmaputra’s floodplain is home to many impoverished communities, making them more vulner\u0002able to floods and natural hazards.43 India has greatly improved its disaster response capacity over the past three decades; natural hazards such as the 2013 Cyclone Phailin and the 2019 Cyclone Fani in the state of Odisha led to the loss of far 9 fewer lives than would have been expected one or two decades prior.44 State governments, especially in Odisha and Tamil Nadu, have also been active in this arena. At the national level, India enacted the Disas\u0002ter Management Act in 2005, which, among other things, created a civilian-led National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) overseen by the home ministry.45 Though the NDRF, with its twelve thousand relief and rescue personnel, was intended to be India’s primary disaster relief agency, it continues to rely greatly on the Indian military when it comes to major natural disaster response.46 Though India has achieved laud\u0002able successes in the past two decades—saving thousands of lives in the wake of natural hazards—there remains space for significant improve\u0002ments in creating adequate civilian-led structures for relief and rescue. Nevertheless, India is often a net disaster relief provider when it comes to South Asia and its neighborhood. The littoral states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh and adjacent Telangana, as well as the northeastern states of Bihar, Manipur, and Assam, are the most climate vulnerable in India’s Bay of Bengal region, according to the New Delhi-based Council on Energy Environment and Water.47 Of the six states, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have lower levels of political contestations and violence (see figure 3). Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Manipur, and West Bengal are the most prone to instability and conflict. The remote nature of Assam and Manipur relative to mainland India adds to their instability risk. Several active or semi-active insurgencies operate in the states of Assam and Manipur. Assam has recently contended with intercommunal violence between various ethnic and religious groups. Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are also sites of significant violence due to Maoist insurgencies. Bihar faces leftist militancy and political clashes, and the state of Telangana has experi\u0002enced consistent left-wing political violence. India is facing the migra\u0002tory effects of political and ethnic violence in Myanmar. More than forty thousand refugees have crossed into its northeastern state of Mizoram.48 Despite the national government’s directive not to accept refugees, local governments have given them shelter due to ethnic kin\u0002ship among borderland communities. Armed violence and instability are known to increase climate vul\u0002nerability, which indicates that zones with both present could see further increases in such vulnerability. In the future, as major natural hazards and intense slow-onset hazards become more threatening, the causal link could also run the other way. Climate Change and Insecurity in the Region 9 10 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region MYANMAR Myanmar, with a population of fifty-five million, is no stranger to severe natural disasters. For example, Cyclone Nargis in 2008 killed 130,000 people, and the unprecedented floods of 2015 were massively destruc\u0002tive. Myanmar ranked second in terms of destruction caused by natural disasters of any country in the world between 2000 and 2019.49 Myan\u0002mar’s climate vulnerability is the highest in four zones, all of which present unique challenges (see figure 4). Its western coast (dominated by Rakhine state) and the Ayeyarwady delta in the south, including the capital of Yangon, are the most vulnerable to major cyclones. Its exten\u0002sive river basins and coastal areas are subject to flooding. In contrast, its central zone, which stretches north of the delta towards China and includes the Sagaing, Magway, and Mandalay regions, is dry, putting it at high risk for drought and lethal heatwaves.50 The far southeast Note: Only states in the Bay of Bengal region are included.

Myanmar is the least wealthy and most fragile of the four Bay of Bengal states. It is also the only state in the region currently wracked by political violence across most of its territory. In February 2021, the military (known as the Tatmadaw) seized power by launching a violent coup.

Political violence is widespread, but is highest in the area north of the capital. 12 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region led to widespread protests, which triggered a brutal military crack\u0002down. Following the imposition of full military rule, the democrati\u0002cally-elected National League for Democracy coordinated with ethnic minority insurgent groups to establish a shadow government, known as the National Unity Government (NUG), and organize insurgents to fight the junta.51 Currently, the military lacks control over large swathes of territory, with the NUG claiming control of about half of the coun\u0002try.52 The western states of Chin and Rakhine, the northern states of Kachin and Shan, and the southeastern Kayin state and Tanintharyi region are sites of major ethnic conflict and insurgency. Myanmar’s political woes have been coupled with increasing poverty rates.53 The Rohingya-dominated state of Rakhine and the borderlands adja\u0002cent to Bangladesh are the most significant climate security hotspots in the country, with Rakhine’s Rohingya Muslim minority experienc\u0002ing mass expulsions and persecution by the Myanmar military since before the 2021 coup. Since the coup, violence has spread to regions in southern and central Myanmar dominated by the majority ethnic group, the Bamar.54 Few regions of the country are free from consis\u0002tent violence (see figure 4). The conflict is already leading to spillover, as renewed fighting within Myanmar has spread to areas adjacent to the Indian, Bangladeshi, and Thai borders. Apart from the more than nine hundred thousand Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh, more than one hundred thousand live in Malaysia. A further ninety thousand ref\u0002ugees have relocated to Thailand (mostly belonging to the Karen ethnic group), and newer refugee flows have been triggered in the aftermath of Myanmar’s 2021 coup, with thousands of Burmese from Chin state fleeing to Thailand and India.55 Authorities there have been reluctant to receive these new refugees and have even pushed some back across the border.56 In the wake of new fighting between the Rohingya-dominated insurgent Arakan Army and the junta, Bangladesh-Myanmar tensions have been catalyzed by exchanges of fire at the border. Myanmar’s major internal political challenges coupled with its high climate vulnerability makes it especially prone to climate change-mag\u0002nified security challenges. None of Myanmar’s active conflicts were caused by climate change, but as climate hazards grow, intersections between climate vulnerability and armed conflict can lead to a self-re\u0002inforcing spiral.57 THAILAND Thailand, with a population of seventy million, suffered the ninth most damage when it comes to natural disasters globally in the 2000–2019 13 period. However, in a relative sense, Thailand is the best positioned of the four states in terms of climate security due to its middle-income status and higher state capacity. Climate vulnerability is generally low across most of the country. However, the city of Bangkok and its neighborhood, in addition to provinces in the far south and the far west (proximate to the borders with Malaysia and Myanmar, respectively), are the exceptions (see figure 5). Climate change will cause significant economic losses to sectors such as tourism, industry, and agriculture, the latter mainly due to the Climate Change and Insecurity in the Region Political Violence and Climate Vulnerability in Thailand Figure 5 Sources: Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project; Yusuf et al., “Climate Change Vulnerability Mapping for Southeast Asia.” Bangkok 0 250 km 0 250 mi Bangkok Climate vulnerability score from Yusuf et al.

Thailand is among the world’s top three exporters of rice, and rice cultivation is a significant source of employment.58 The economic effects of natural disasters have already been considerable.Major floods in the country in 2011 dam\u0002aged or destroyed many large industrial plants and caused $46 billion in losses.59 The Asian tsunami of 2004 killed thousands and badly dam\u0002aged the tourism sector in popular areas such as Phuket. Middle-tier companies were hurt much more than larger ones, which tend to have better connections to government officials and financial institutions.60 This is one example of how natural disasters can open up existing fis\u0002sures in society.61 The city of Bangkok is greatly threatened by rising sea levels and could be underwater by 2050. Meanwhile, central Thailand suffers from drought vulnerability. Rice yields, the staple source of the coun\u0002try’s food security, are likely to decrease each year in the worst future emission scenarios.62 Extreme heat could make large portions of the country unsafe for outdoor labor by mid-century. Thailand endured political instability under the populist govern\u0002ment of Thaksin Shinawatra in the early 2000s. Since the 2014 coup, the military has largely stabilized the situation. Despite this, political violence is still common in the far south, which is also the most cli\u0002mate vulnerable part of Thailand (see figure 5). The Barisan Revolusi Nasional, an Islamist secessionist group, continues to carry out attacks against civilian and government targets in southern regions.63 The vio\u0002lence has led to a total of 7,300 deaths and 13,600 injuries since 2004.64 The relative stability in central and northern Thailand is, however, not guaranteed to last. Renewed fighting in Myanmar’s Kayin state has forced thousands of new refugees into Thailand, mostly members of the minority Karen ethnic group. Deep divides within the Thai polity also persist. Former Prime Minister Thaksin’s Pheu Thai party remains popular in the north and northeast of the country and appears to be making a national comeback as of a May 2022 election, despite signifi\u0002cant opposition across Thailand.65 Nevertheless, Thailand is relatively well positioned on climate security among the Bay of Bengal states. However, its economy will be increasingly challenged by extreme heat, cyclones, falling agricultural yields, and rising sea levels. Threats to rice cultivation and exports will grow, putting farming livelihoods at risk. Thailand could also become a much greater magnet for refugees in the region if Myanmar’s situation continues to worsen. 15 In the Bangladesh-Myanmar-North Eastern India corridor, extreme climate vulnerability and a high risk of natural disasters often exist alongside political instability (see figure 6). The entanglement of the two issues will greatly increase in the event of a 1.5 or 2˚C climb in global temperatures by the 2050s. While the eventual outcomes of this entanglement are not entirely predictable, the following four sce\u0002narios can act as policy planning guides to ensure greater regional resilience and planning to meet the security challenges from slow\u0002and fast-onset hazards. MYANMAR MELTDOWN The first scenario is the magnification of Myanmar’s domestic conflict due to climate change. A climate shock such as a severe cyclone would likely increase the pressure on Myanmar’s already unstable govern\u0002ment. Alternatively, a combination of several smaller natural disasters and compounding, slow-onset climate events—particularly sea-level rise in coastal provinces—could have the same effect. The agricultural consequences of current drought conditions in central Myanmar are already reducing livelihood opportunities, triggering displacement, and providing recruits for insurgent groups. In the most affected areas, including Rakhine State, Ayeyarwady Region, Sagaing Region, and Bago Region, escalating extremism, surging poverty, and internal dis\u0002placement could lead to a political crisis. Any of these potential crises could lead the military government to lose control over more territory as its capacity and legitimacy weaken, permitting current insurgencies to spiral. Spillover effects such as increased refugee flows could create opportunities for interstate clashes, especially at the Bangladeshi SCENARIOS FOR REGIONAL INSTABILITY Scenarios for Regional Instability 16 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region border. Refugees could also travel along sea routes from Myanmar to other coastal states in the region.66 An influx of refugees into India, Thailand, and Bangladesh would greatly stress the three countries, exacerbating local ethnic tensions and giving a boost to emerging insurgencies, especially in India. If Sino-Indian relations deteriorate further, China could be tempted to support insur\u0002gencies in India’s most unstable states.67 The worst-case outcome would be a military dispute drawing in Bangladesh, China, India, and Myanmar. Of all four scenarios, Thailand will be most challenged by this sce\u0002nario, with major refugee flows and the spillover of armed conflict affecting its border regions and its major tourist zones, all while climate change continues to directly harm Thailand’s coastal economy and agricultural industry. Coupled with domestic tensions in Thailand and the intensification of insurgencies in its southern provinces, spillover from Myanmar is especially dangerous. Preventing or coping with this Zone of greatest climate security concern INDIA BAY OF BENGAL CHINA VIETNAM PAKISTAN THAILAND MYANMAR BANGLADESH NGLADESH The Bay of Bengal Region Figure 6 17 scenario will require major improvements to HADR readiness and con\u0002certed efforts by major powers and regional institutions to tamp down interstate tensions in the region resulting from potential state failure in Myanmar and exacerbated by climate change. EMBATTLED BANGLADESH A second potential climate security concern in the Bay of Bengal is driven by the possibility that Bangladesh becomes increasingly beset by climate change and unable to cope over the next fifteen to thirty years. An outflow of climate migrants from Bangladesh could be triggered by either a series of major natural disasters or slow-onset effects such as agricultural and coastal degradation in a context of stalled economic growth and growing domestic division. Though Bangladesh has been reasonably stable politically for more than a decade, the potential for political unrest remains a distinct possibility. Bangladesh is also facing increasingly severe economic headwinds. Though GDP and human development metrics have shown impressive growth, most employment creation has been in the informal sector.68 Exports have grown, but the import content within these exports has grown faster.69 The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed vulnerable pop\u0002ulations greatly, and climate change could cause the economy to stall well before the country reaches middle-income status. At the high end of estimates, climate migration from Bangladesh could reach fifteen to twenty-five million by 2050. A fraction of these migrants would cross into India, providing fodder for a deeper con\u0002struction of anti-migrant politics and increased interstate tensions between India and Bangladesh. India’s northeastern states are faced with major flooding and drought, which will be magnified by China’s planned construction of a major dam on the Brahmaputra River. Insta\u0002bility in India’s North Eastern Region could escalate further if Bangla\u0002desh were to fail to accommodate for climate change. Preventing this scenario requires intergovernmental and external actors to aid Bangla\u0002desh to the maximum possible extent to cope with its climate challenges and facilitate continued economic growth in the country. India would also need to contain its anti-migrant politics to manage this scenario. BANGLADESH BOOMING Bangladesh’s success story in combating climate change is the main driver of this third scenario. This success would be due to a combination Scenarios for Regional Instability 18 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region of continued economic growth and greater commitments to strength\u0002ening community resilience and national HADR capacity. Thus, though climate hazards increasingly wrack the country, Bangladesh could be able to stay a step ahead of them and even emerge as a provider of solutions in the Bay of Bengal region. However, Myanmar’s instability is likely to increase in this sce\u0002nario, magnified by climate change. This instability will continue to produce flows of refugees to Bangladesh, India, and Thailand. North Eastern India continues to muddle along with lower levels of growth and industrialization. This could induce a counterintuitive migration of low-income Indians, alongside displaced populations from Myan\u0002mar, into Bangladesh. (According to Bangladesh, Indian migrants are already present in the country.)70 Bangladesh will continue to be chal\u0002lenged. It will need to manage migrant arrivals due to its relative success while coping with its own still-considerable climate problems. Even if Bangladesh sees success with adaptation efforts, urbanization of the population will present its own challenges; Dhaka and Chittagong will struggle with unchecked growth. Though all four Bay of Bengal states are stressed in this scenario, Bangladesh and Thailand could emerge as zones of relative stability, making them viable regional leaders for adaptation, conflict stabiliza\u0002tion, and HADR efforts. Though Bangladesh significantly outpaces India in this scenario in terms of its adaptive capacity and economic growth, India still remains an important regional actor due to its sheer size and considerable HADR capacities. WALLED WOES The fourth scenario would result from states turning inward to greater isolationism as a result of the damaging effects of climate change and struggles with governance issues. Growth would greatly decline or stall across the region, and international actors would have to work directly with individual states on climate security rather than regional organiza\u0002tions, which would be mostly paralyzed and much less effectual. With\u0002out deep regional cooperation, countries would have poorer coping abilities and therefore worse economic futures. Since all four states are struggling to cope with the entangled effects of climate disasters and security challenges, climate migrants would have no clear and attractive destination state. This would likely result in minimal cross-border migration, though large-scale internal migra\u0002tion would remain a major phenomenon. Interstate cooperation would 19 be low, leading to suboptimal economic integration and climate prob\u0002lem-solving in the Bay of Bengal region. Regional organizations lose influence in this scenario. For instance, the influence of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over Myanmar would decline even more. Myanmar’s insurgencies could either lose steam or successfully defeat the central government. If the junta is defeated, the various components of the NUG could see an opportunity to carve out their respective ethnic states. At its most extreme, this could cause a breakup of Myanmar into multiple states. Thailand can be expected to do relatively better in this scenario, given its larger state capacity. The four scenarios illustrate the magnitude of the climate-secu\u0002rity challenge in the region, the overcoming of which is in most cases beyond the national capacity of any one of the states (see table 1). Thus, cooperative options for addressing the climate crisis that are regional or international in nature should be prioritized, as they have the greatest potential to enhance climate security in the Bay of Bengal region.

Several organizations at all three levels are candidates to lead in pro\u0002viding policy options. Of the bigger states, the role of the United States is crucial in many of these, as will be the contributions of China and India. Bangladesh, Thailand, and Singapore can also con\u0002tribute significantly. REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS The Bay of Bengal straddles South Asia and Southeast Asia, which have historically been characterized by two separate regional security com\u0002plexes. Thus, regional organizations are not well-positioned to tackle common threats in the Bay of Bengal’s littoral states. Traditionally, South Asia’s security dynamic has only minimally involved South\u0002east Asia, and vice versa. This is reflected in the existence of separate regional organizations. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is made up of South Asian states and was founded in 1985, while ASEAN has represented most of Southeast Asia since 1967. SAARC has been essentially paralyzed since 2016 due to elevated India-Pakistan tensions that culminated in a major military clash in February 2019.71 India’s relationships with other South Asian states are comparatively stable, though tension over the growing presence of China continues to limit the potential of cooperation.72 In contrast, ASEAN has evolved to become a far more effec\u0002tive and integrated organization.73 In 2011, ASEAN established the Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster COOPERATIVE POLICY OPTIONS 21 Management (AHA Center).74 It has organized relief missions for Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the 2012 Myanmar earthquake, and other climate disasters.75 The ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meet\u0002ing, known as the ADMM-Plus forum, provides an opportunity for international cooperation between the defense ministers of ten Southeast Asian states and eight major foreign powers.76 ASEAN has the potential to cooperate more deeply with South Asian coun\u0002tries on governance initiatives.77 Such cooperation would allow ASEAN to work towards meeting climate security needs for the entire Bay of Bengal region, including nonmember states in South Asia. However, ASEAN’s singular focus on Southeast Asia and its strained relationship with Myanmar constrain its role as a major climate security actor in the Bay of Bengal region. The limitations of regional organizations enhance the importance of interregional structures in finding solutions. INTERREGIONAL COOPERATION Several interregional organizations and mechanisms exist in the Bay of Bengal region, some of which could play a particularly useful role in climate security. Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation The most relevant interregional organization in the region is the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Coop\u0002eration (BIMSTEC).78 It was founded in 1997 in Bangkok with four Cooperative Policy Options 22 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region original members (Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand).79 Myanmar joined later that year, and Nepal and Bhutan joined in 2004. The organization was relatively inactive until 2016, when India initi\u0002ated more frequent summits and greater streamlining of its charter and policies. BIMSTEC has now held five summits and has organized its activities into seven pillars, with a separate member state assigned to lead each pillar.80 The BIMSTEC charter makes a reference to climate change under the rubric of peace and stability in the Bay of Bengal region.81 Thus, climate security is implicitly included in its charter. The organization has conducted two disaster management exercises, most recently in 2020 in India.82 In recent years, the organization’s focus has been on developing bottom-up, community-based approaches to disaster risk management.83 Considering its membership, BIMSTEC is the organi\u0002zation best positioned to tackle climate security challenges in the Bay of Bengal. Also contributing to its potential efficacy, complete consen\u0002sus is not required for BIMSTEC members to act on a particular issue. The organization operates on a three-plus-one principle, under which three members can initiate action as long as a fourth supports the move, even if other members do not wish to participate or do not show explicit support.84 This principle can allow members to overcome paralysis that could otherwise prevent joint climate action if, for example, tensions between Bangladesh and Myanmar increase. Despite its potential, BIMSTEC faces multiple challenges that it will have to overcome in order to emerge as a serious climate secu\u0002rity provider. First, the crisis in Myanmar has created major rifts in its neighborhood, threatening the unity of BIMSTEC (as it has of ASEAN). Myanmar-Bangladesh border tensions are high, and a lim\u0002ited war cannot be entirely ruled out.85 Malaysia and Indonesia have also taken a tough stand against Myanmar’s military junta.86 Myanmar lies within the zone of greatest climate security concern in the Bay of Bengal, and political alienation from powerful states and groups in South and Southeast Asia does not bode well for its participation in cli\u0002mate security initiatives. Furthermore, BIMSTEC lacks the financial capacity to emerge as a forum for positive-sum cooperation. Its organizational budget of roughly $200,000 is far lower than, for example, ASEAN’s budget of $20 million.87 Member state representatives to BIMSTEC are of ambassadorial rank, below the ministerial rank that would boost more decisive action.88 The institution does not yet have sufficient autonomy to propose innovative policy options.89 BIMSTEC’s long record of 23 sluggishness (despite its recent spike in activity) has also created a path dependence that will be hard to overcome. Finally, smaller states have concerns that India could play a dispro\u0002portionate role in BIMSTEC; proposals to include more Southeast Asian states were not favored by India at the organization’s founding.90 BIMSTEC’s security pillar (which encompasses counterterrorism, climate change, and energy) is to be headed by India without any term limits, according to the organization’s new charter.91 It should be noted, however, that BIMSTEC’s recent energization has largely been a prod\u0002uct of India’s leadership. Indian Ocean Rim Association The Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) describes itself as an “inter-governmental organisation aimed at strengthening regional cooperation and sustainable development within the Indian Ocean region through its 23 Member States and 10 Dialogue Partners.”92 Ban\u0002gladesh currently chairs the association. The IORA includes practically all littoral states of the Indian Ocean ranging from South Africa in the west to Australia in the east. France is the only non-littoral member by virtue of its territories in the Indian Ocean. Notably, especially given its extreme climate vulnerability, Myanmar is not a member state of IORA. Disaster risk management, which encompasses preparation, mitiga\u0002tion, and recovery capabilities for natural hazards such as tsunamis and earthquakes, is one of IORA’s eight priority areas. The IORA aims to strengthen “partnerships between governments and institutions to strengthen [disaster risk management] through the development of joint training programmes, sharing of experiences and best practices, building capacity and enhancing the technical capabilities within the region.”93 It has held training exercises on early warning systems and geospatial technologies and evolved guidelines for HADR operations. India is currently chair of the IORA’s Core Group on DRM. It hosted the First Experts Group Meeting on DRM in 2021.94 Singapore Regional HADR Coordination Center The Singaporean government established the Changi Regional HADR Coordination Center (RHCC) in 2014, focused on military-to-mili\u0002tary cooperation to combat natural disasters.95 The RHCC has a wide set of partner states including Thailand and India in the Bay of Bengal region as well as the United States, Australia, China, and France, Cooperative Policy Options 24 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region among others. Liaison officers from all partner states work together, coordinating relief missions and intervening directly upon the request of disaster-affected states. Thus far, the RHCC has mainly tackled storms and floods, includ\u0002ing in Malaysia in 2014, Nepal in 2015, and Laos in 2018, as well as the tsunami in Indonesia in 2018.96 The Nepal operation was its largest thus far, with Singapore’s military and international partners partici\u0002pating. The RHCC is also equipped to respond to droughts. 97 India and Thailand are partner states, and the RHCC conducted an exercise with Bangladesh in 2019.98 The RHCC has pioneered a new command-and\u0002control software tool that eases information sharing and coordination for HADR operations.99 It aims to increase its relationships beyond regional militaries to include NGOs and relief organizations.100 Other Organizations Other interregional organizations also have the potential to play a role in meeting the climate security challenge in the Bay of Bengal. The Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), is a consortium of Indian Ocean littoral states organized by India in 2008.101 It brings together the navies and coast guards of twenty-eight member states with the aim of meeting maritime threats, including those from climate change and natural hazards. India seeks to be the central power in IONS, whose wide membership brings together states as diverse as Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.102 IONS conducted a HADR exercise involving fifteen states in March 2022.103 The Quad is a four-nation informal grouping comprising Aus\u0002tralia, India, Japan, and the United States. Its second phase, after a long hiatus, began in 2017. Since 2021, the Quad’s summits have occurred at the highest levels of member states. The Quad’s focus, though not stated explicitly in its communiques, is on competing with and countering China. Past statements have centered on provid\u0002ing public goods to the region, including climate security resources, though its record of delivery has been poor thus far.104 The four states have however made most progress in military coordination to counter China with increasingly sophisticated military exercises on an annual basis, despite the Quad’s official claim that hard security is not part of its agenda.105 Some ASEAN states have expressed unease with the advent of the Quad.106 The Quad has potential to play a useful role if it sticks more closely to its declared focus on provision of public goods and improves its delivery performance.107 25 The Heads of Coast Guard Agencies Meeting (HACGAM) is an informal forum of coast guards of twenty participant states.108 It includes all four Bay of Bengal states as well as Australia, China, Indone\u0002sia, and Japan, among others. Japan initiated the grouping. HACGAM is a lower-profile grouping whose informality could provide it with agil\u0002ity to tackle climate-magnified disaster-readiness challenges.109 COOPERATION WITH MAJOR POWERS Major powers currently influential in the Bay of Bengal, namely the United States, China, and India, have all played a role in combating the climate change-related security challenges in the region. The United States has been highly active in the region. An early example was the U.S.-led Operation Sea Angel to aid Bangladesh following the 1991 cyclone. The operation was almost entirely sea-based, U.S. troops car\u0002ried few arms, and operations were conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the govern\u0002ment of Japan. China provided a small contingent as well.110 A significant moment for U.S. involvement in HADR in the region was the Asian tsunami of 2004, after which the United States worked with the Indian and other militaries in the region to provide relief to thousands of victims. USAID has played a significant and beneficial role in the region for decades, especially in Bangladesh, and continues to maintain its presence in the region.111 China’s participation in “disaster diplomacy” in the region is more recent.112 Beijing’s contributions have included the creation of the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund in 2015 and a significant increase in funding for the UN Refugee Agency since 2017.113 China and ASEAN signed an agreement on disaster management in 2014, which included more than $8 million in Chinese support for ASEAN, including its AHA Center.114 Meanwhile, India seeks to become the primary actor in the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean regions when it comes to HADR activities; it has participated in numerous bilateral and multilateral HADR exercises and disaster management missions, including a 2019 mission in the wake of Cyclone Idai in Mozambique.115 Cooperation between the United States and China is essential to manage the most adverse scenarios. Such cooperation seems unlikely in the current Cold War-like conditions, but its potential is nevertheless worth exploring. The United States sees China as its primary rival in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in the maritime dimension. The Joe Biden administration has acknowledged potential for cooperation Cooperative Policy Options 26 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region with China on climate change, but meaningful cooperation has been scant in recent years. Bilateral dialogue on climate action was regretta\u0002bly ended by China following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) visit to Taiwan in August 2022, though these conversations have now resumed in the wake of the Xi Jinping-Joe Biden meeting in Indonesia during the 2022 Group of 20 (G20) summit.116 Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Thailand have varied relations with the United States and China. Bangladesh has traditionally had a stronger relationship with the United States, though ties have become somewhat strained recently.117 China’s presence in Bangladesh has grown significantly, even as its rival India has improved its own rela\u0002tions with Bangladesh over the past decade. U.S. treaty ally Thailand has drifted away from Washington and closer to Beijing in recent years, though it retains considerable ties with the United States.118 Post-coup Myanmar has been sanctioned by the United States and criticized by ASEAN. India is a close U.S. partner when it comes to countering China. India has, however, been uncomfortable with prioritizing cli\u0002mate security, arguing that climate is primarily a development issue.119 HADR is one of the few areas of U.S.-China military-to-military cooperation in recent years under the U.S.-China Disaster Manage\u0002ment Exchange (DME), an annual exercise that began in 2005.120 The DME is a forum for the two militaries to exchange knowledge and build best practices to prepare for natural disasters in other countries. For example, the fifteenth DME in 2019 simulated responses to a major volcanic eruption through a tabletop exercise with fifteen American and fifteen Chinese participants. Medical aid, search and rescue, envi\u0002ronmental assessment, and debris clearance were among the simulated responses.121 The sixteenth DME in 2020 centered on planning multi\u0002national coordinated response scenarios to climate change-magnified shocks including flooding, typhoons, and pandemics.122 As described previously, Singapore’s RHCC promotes HADR activities involv\u0002ing partners well beyond Southeast Asia including the United States, China, India, and Japan, who are members. Another Asian platform for U.S.-China HADR cooperation is the annual Cobra Gold exercise. Hosted by Thailand and typically involving multiple countries, the exer\u0002cise includes Chinese and American contingents, as well as Singapore’s RHCC. Chinese troops are restricted to the relatively limited HADR component of the exercise.123 27 Given the transnational nature and massive scale of the threat posed by climate change in the Bay of Bengal region, limiting its harms will only be possible with international cooperation. For policymakers in the United States, boosting adaptation financing, championing Ban\u0002gladeshi leadership, and supporting regional actors such as BIMSTEC are the most promising options. Greater U.S.-China HADR coordina\u0002tion, in partnership with Singapore and the Bay’s littoral states, would greatly improve recovery capacity in the aftermath of future disasters. The following are policy recommendations, chiefly for the U.S. govern\u0002ment, for tackling the Bay of Bengal’s climate security challenges. The United States should prioritize adaptation and loss and damage financing in the Bay of Bengal region. The focus of the United States in international climate negotiations and action has been overwhelmingly on mitigation activities, while adaptation often gets the short end of the stick. Of the total climate finance dispensed internationally (of which the United States contrib\u0002utes less, relative to its GDP, than several other wealthy countries), only a quarter is dedicated to adaptation.124 The Secretary General of the United Nations has encouraged member states to spend half of all available climate funding on adaptation.125 Investing in adaptation is critical, as it is a vital part of preventive measures that save lives and reduce the much higher costs of later HADR operations in the wake of climate-magnified natural hazards. When it comes to loss and damage, the principle of liability and compensation (that high-emission states are obliged to compensate climate change-related losses in vulnerable states) is not embraced by the United States.126 The Climate Vulner\u0002able Forum, a coalition of low-income and highly climate-vulnerable RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations 28 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region states including Bangladesh, strongly pushed for loss and damage to be addressed more meaningfully.127 Ultimately, the United States agreed to support a separate financing facility for loss and damage at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Con\u0002vention on Climate Change (COP27). However, the fund will now need to be financed adequately. The United States and India should support Bangladesh’s emer\u0002gence as leader for climate action in the Bay of Bengal region. Bangladesh’s geography is at the fulcrum of the Bay of Bengal, and in terms of climate hazard, Bangladesh is one of the most threatened states in the region. Its government has long embraced the concept of climate security. Bangladesh has recently taken huge strides in climate adaptation and DRM. It hosts the BIMSTEC secretariat and major cen\u0002ters of climate research including the International Centre for Climate Change and Development and the Centre for Bay of Bengal Studies.128 Bangladesh also has uniquely positive relationships with India, the United States, and China, and hosts many international donors and aid organizations such as USAID. The United States, with USAID at the forefront, and India should further support Bangladesh to act as a node of climate knowledge and policy in the region in the adaptation and DRM arenas. This includes more widely disseminating Bangladesh’s approaches to DRM, which have been recognized as an international best practice, forging deeper research links with its institutes on adap\u0002tive practices on coastal habitats and saltwater-resistant agriculture, empowering it more within BIMSTEC and other regional forums, and centering its climate institutes in regional collaborations and events on climate security. The United States and China should increase climate coopera\u0002tion activity in the Bay of Bengal by working with regional orga\u0002nizations and initiatives. The United States and China, along with India, are the biggest powers in the Bay of Bengal due to the reach of their militaries and their strong economic ties with states in the region. Though U.S.-China cli\u0002mate dialogue has resumed, any hope for the expansion of the DME appears to be slim for the foreseeable future. However, such coopera\u0002tion is essential for solving the climate crisis and would greatly aid the Bay of Bengal region in meeting its challenges. South and Southeast Asia, including the Bay of Bengal, provide an ideal lower-profile space for the United States and China to deepen their currently minimal 29 habits of cooperation, even if indirectly. With the exception of India, all states in the region have positive relations with China. The United States and China should greatly deepen their climate dialogue (espe\u0002cially on HADR activities) through their joint participation in inter\u0002regional organizations and initiatives. Such a dialogue would be likely to attract less criticism than any higher-profile bilateral initiatives, drawing less hostility among anti-engagement constituencies in both countries toward each other. Singapore’s RHCC is a suitable site for communication between the United States and China. Expanding the currently minimal HADR activities involved in Thailand’s Cobra Gold exercise or extending the reach of BIMSTEC through a “BIMS\u0002TEC-Plus” arrangement are also potential collaborative pathways. Singapore should facilitate greater collaboration between the United States and China on regional climate security initiatives. Singapore is not a Bay of Bengal littoral country. However, Singa\u0002pore’s RHCC is a vital center for HADR activities that have involved the Bay of Bengal states. The RHCC counts the United States and China in its membership, enhancing its capabilities. The organization should increase the integration of the Bay of Bengal states in HADR activities by coordinating directly with BIMSTEC and its member states. More broadly, Singapore provides a stable environment with excellent institutions for regional states, including those currently at odds, to form habits of collaboration and knowledge exchange. The United States and India both have excellent relations with Singapore. They should encourage Singapore to play a greater role in the region on two fronts: through HADR with the RHCC’s increased involvement and as a site for knowledge exchange and dialogue on climate security. BIMSTEC should adopt additional reforms that enhance its capacity and internal equity and aim to emerge as the cen\u0002tral organizational actor on climate security in the Bay of Bengal region. As the only international organization spanning all states in the Bay of Bengal littoral, BIMSTEC is the natural candidate to lead cli\u0002mate security efforts in the region. Currently, dominant member state India does not officially accept the climate security approach. However, climate adaptation, DRM, and HADR activities (when planned with sensitivity to state sovereignty)—the three vital components of climate security solutions—are readily embraced in New Delhi. Bangladesh, where BIMSTEC’s secretariat is located, accepts the policy framework Recommendations 30 Climate Security and Instability in the Bay of Bengal Region of climate security and has taken an affirmative role in UN debates on the issue.129 The first major step is for BIMSTEC to emerge as a seri\u0002ous player from what was a mostly moribund organization until 2016. The internal reform process, prodded by India, has begun, but much still remains to be done. The completion of the reform process is a pre\u0002requisite for other actions such as enlarging engagement with other significant actors in the region and emerging as a solutions leader in the Bay of Bengal on climate security. BIMSTEC can be strengthened by substantially increasing its budget and raising the level of diplomatic representation from each state to a more senior rank from the current ambassadorial level. Its activities should be evenly split between adapta\u0002tion and HADR coordination. To respond to concerns about India’s dis\u0002proportionate weight in the organization, creating rotating chairs with term limits for each of its seven pillars of action should be considered. This could engender greater buy-in and contributions from smaller member states. By virtue of its size, India will inevitably be “first among equals” in BIMSTEC. India can both further its own interests and con\u0002tribute to climate security by inducing greater commitments from its smaller neighbors. BIMSTEC, being a “local” actor, is best positioned to tackle adaptation and DRM activities in the Bay of Bengal region. Adaptation and DRM projects require gradual, ongoing work involv\u0002ing significant local and community participation components. This implies the direct involvement of not just national governments but also the administrations of federal states or territories in each of the littoral countries. BIMSTEC could also be expanded to a “BIMSTEC-Plus” format to include other major powers. ASEAN has taken this path through mechanisms such as ADMM-Plus and the ASEAN Regional Forum in order to strengthen and formalize Southeast Asia’s ties with major world powers. A “BIMSTEC-Plus” grouping could include pow\u0002erful actors already involved in the region’s affairs such as the United States, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and ASEAN. Conclusion 31 CONCLUSION The highly populated and economically challenged region of the Bay of Bengal demands greater focus from regional and international actors to ensure the stability and viability of the states and societies of the region as the effects of climate change escalate. Coping with these challenges is beyond the capacities of individual states in the region, especially as the world heads toward a 1.5 to 2°C temperature increase. Regional, inter\u0002regional, and international cooperation is essential to generate solu\u0002tions. Such cooperation needs to be pursued. There is no time to lose. 32 ENDNOTES Endnotes 1.

[Articles](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/recent) India’s Prime Minister identifies the Maoist (or “Naxalite”) insurgency as India’s “single biggest internal security challenge.” The insurgency is today severe in scale and violence with 2,212 violent incidents in 2010 causing 1,175 casualties (713 civilian, 285 security force and 171 guerilla), a 63% increase since 2008. [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn1) Today, about 10,000 – 40,000 full-time insurgents wage a protracted peoples war to overthrow the Indian state across a vast “Red Corridor,” affecting 20 of India’s 28 states. India is currently waging a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoists, deploying 70,000 paramilitary police in November 2009, many to the insurgent heartland in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, where 50 percent of all attacks were recorded in 2010. [\\[ii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn2) The Maoists benefit from “two Indias living side by side.” [\\[iii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn3) India is rapidly modernizing, but many inequalities are also widening – between rich and poor, town and country and upper and lower castes. Conditions for large swathes of rural India still compare with the worst of sub-Saharan Africa, and in many remote areas the state has long been absent. However, economic grievances alone do not correlate with Maoism, and in net terms, the Indian state has tremendous internal legitimacy – only 26 of India’s 100 poorest districts, and 20 of its 100 most illiterate are Maoist afflicted. [\\[iv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn4) In truth, Maoist legitimacy is restricted to the extreme end of India’s deprivation scale – amongst the adivasis (tribals) and dalits (“untouchables”) – where in addition to extreme human misery, a broader set of social and status grievances are being inflamed. Analyst Eric Randolph astutely noted on the issue that, “People can put up with a great deal of structural violence in their lives \\[…\\] particularly when it is all they have known. Instead, what tends to trigger acts of violent rebellion are specific flashpoints of injustice.” [\\[v\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn5) For the adivasis and tribals, there are plenty such flashpoints. India’s tribals – in particular the Gonds of Central India [\\[vi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn6) – are under intense assault from state and private corporate interests, and are being pushed off their forestlands by giant hydro, logging and mining projects for little compensation and rehabilitation. The dalits, already the bottom rung of landless agricultural farmers, are similarly disproportionately impacted by the tumultuous changes of modernization on the Indian countryside, and discriminated against daily despite legislation. Tribals make up the core fighting strength of the Maoist insurgency – their narrow eight percent share of the population is still sizeable given India’s 1.2 billion peoples. The Maoist insurgency follows on a long history of peasant and tribal rebellion against predatory state structures on the subcontinent. It originated in its present form in a small village in Naxalbari, West Bengal, where in 1967, villagers armed with bows and arrows resisted police and feudal landlords with bows and arrows. [\\[vii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn7) The incident galvanized the Indian Communist movement, which found a fertile audience for its Chinese-inspired Maoist rhetoric of land reform and overthrow of feudal class structures. Militant Communism has since waxed and waned for the past half century, crushed by security forces and de-legitimized by the Indo-Chinese War of 1962, but the current phase of escalation is the strongest and most violent in history. In 2004, the two largest insurgent groups – the People’s War Group and the Maoist Communist Center – merged to form the new Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI-M). The merger elevated security hardliners in insurgent command, reiterated their commitment to violent and large-scale “peoples war,” and immediately increased insurgent kinetic activity. Today, the CPI-M accounts for 90% of attacks and 95% of fatalities from “left-wing terrorism,” according to the Indian Home Ministry. [\\[viii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn8) Maoist insurgents are tactically effective and intimately familiar with their jungle terrain. They employ classic guerilla tactics, dispersing in the face of organized force and prioritize their links with the population –often through violent intimidation. Their dispersed organizational structure mitigates the risk of being decisively impacted by targeted counterinsurgent (CI) operations. Local cells have tremendous autonomy, reflected in the fact that since 2007, six of the fourteen members of the Politburo, the highest echelon of insurgent command, have been arrested, to little discernible impact in the field. [\\[ix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn9) Unusual in COIN campaigns, Maoist guerillas have the tactical advantage over Indian security forces, and have demonstrated the ability to conduct sophisticated large-scale operations. Insurgents assault training centers and police stations to capture weaponry, attack jails to break out captured comrades and target judges and state functionaries to weaken state presence. Their lethality has grown with the use of IEDs, which now result in the majority of CI casualties. Despite a total lack of external support, the Maoists have ready access to funding – territories under their control are resource-rich and the insurgents maintain an extensive and lucrative extortion network that may net them as much as 14 billion rupees ($300 million) annually. [\\[x\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn10) Part of the insurgent “tax” is explosives used in the mining sector, which companies are often in no position to refuse. [\\[xi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn11) **A Military-Centric Response** India has grown acutely aware of the Maoist threat, but the effort to date remains vastly inadequate, both in mobilizing capacity and in implementing policy. The current counterinsurgent (CI) strategy is typically Indian – manpower-intensive and enemy-centric. It emphasizes building up force numbers to “saturate” areas with government forces and prioritizes kinetic action to suffocate the insurgency by attrition. Only lip service is paid to Western-style population-centric strategy; CI forces are present to target insurgents, not secure the population. The resultant flood of ill-trained and ill-equipped soldiers conducting large-scale sweep and commando operations has exposed civilian populations to collateral damage and abuse, increased Maoist legitimacy and recruitment, and left populations open to reprisal attacks by insurgents. As such, it likely that the scale and intensity of violence will increase in the short-term, but over the longer-term, the sheer mass of government capacity may tip the balance. Even so, brute military force is unlikely to ever fully extinguish an insurgency that is driven primarily, if not exclusively, by social and status grievances. In India’s federalist structure, states assume primary responsibility for combating Maoism, but their inadequacy has forced central “paramilitary” police forces to assume the leading COIN role. “Operation Green Hunt” launched in November 2009 deployed about 70,000 Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) personnel (split roughly evenly between combat and support staff) to reach a 2011 end-strength of 73 battalions across Maoist-affected states. [\\[xii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn12) The CRPF is India’s largest internal security force and is a resource provider of sorts for the central government – sending emergency infusions of armed police to insecure areas across the country. [\\[xiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn13) The nomenclature of “paramilitary” typically attributed to the CRPF may overestimate its true capabilities – it is nowhere close to being a specialized CI force. [\\[xiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn14) In Kashmir, some CRPF units received intensified resourcing and training allowing them to independently secure key terrain districts, [\\[xv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn15) but in net terms, the CRPF is subject to all the problems of the Indian police sector including chronic shortfalls of equipment, training, leadership, and logistical and administrative support. It struggles in basic constabulary operations – let alone open combat against a tactically proficient insurgent on home terrain. Symbolic of the challenge, some CRPF units’ still lack protective vests, even while deployed in frontline combat roles! [\\[xvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn16) For anti-Maoist operations, the CRPF is supported by other state armed police forces, i.e. those state police units trained for higher grade law and order problems, including India Reserve Battalions (IRB). These forces are more competent than the regular police, but there is generally a net decline in combat capacity, discipline and professionalism down the hierarchy of security institutions. Scale, capacity and terrain challenges severely hamper the CI force. 70,000 troops cannot by themselves realistically expect to affect any measurable difference over a population of at least 450 million people across 1.86 million square kilometers of tough, remote terrain [\\[xvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn17) – especially without adequate support from effective civil police for regular law and order functions. The UN recommends a peacetime police-to-population ratio of 222 policemen per 100,000 members of the population, which India – and especially its insurgency-affected areas – falls far short of. [\\[xviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn18) In the Maoist heartland of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, new figures show their police-to-population ratios at 226 and 206 in 2010, [\\[xix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn19) a dramatic improvement (at least on paper) from 2000, when the ratio was a mere 50! [\\[xx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn20) Other states lag far behind. Orissa remains at 136, West Bengal at 100, and Bihar at just 74. [\\[xxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn21) Numbers tell only part of the story. Indian police are notoriously corrupt and brutal by Western standards. Draconian sedition laws punish even the semblance of sympathy for the Maoist cause, [\\[xxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn22) and anti-Maoist operations regularly leave behind a trail of destruction – including serious abuses such as torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and rape. [\\[xxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn23) In the field many units – other than some elite forces – are tactically outmatched. Maoists benefit from the guerilla’s ability to choose the time and place of engagement, allowing them to confront the state at its weakest points. Coordinated attacks have penetrated high-security areas with relative impunity, but most notable was the 2010 Maoist ambush in Dantewada that killed 76 soldiers of the 62nd CRPF Battalion, the single largest loss of life in Indian COIN history. The event deeply undercut the Indian government’s claims of progress, and revealed systemic failures. 62 Bn. had served previously in anti-Naxal operations in Bihar, but like other CRPF units was shifted in an ad hoc manner on the basis of availability rather than suitability for the mission. As a result, it failed to acclimatize to the local physical and human terrain, evident when the force found itself trapped on a narrow jungle path. An IED was able to halt the entire column by disabling the lead vehicle, and well-positioned guerillas prevented any retaliatory maneuver. [\\[xxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn24) Chronic deficiencies in leadership were also evident – not uncommon in a force that sees its best officers poached by other agencies. [\\[xxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn25) The unit commander reportedly lied about his position to avoid a long-range field patrol, and failed to report a lost radio that likely allowed guerillas to track to column over several days. [\\[xxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn26) Insurgent intelligence dominance was easily evident – the Maoists were able to maneuver 1,000 men into place without detection, no doubt benefiting from at least some local support. Dantewada was an exceptional incident, but there are a legion other equipment and training challenges that limit CI abilities. Drastic expansion in force size has come without a commensurate emphasis on building up an adequate support base. Troops are barracked in terrible living conditions and there is widespread resentment at the perceived lack of political support, as well as the lack of clarity and resources with which to conduct their missions. Force protection is low, especially against IEDs. Deployed counter-IED equipment is limited [\\[xxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn27) and current armored vehicles provide inadequate protection, forcing a reliance on vulnerable dismounted patrols. New armored vehicles are being introduced – but Maoists have generally adapted by increasing the size of their bombs. [\\[xxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn28) Unsurprisingly, morale is low. One soldier angrily declared to an embedded reporter, “Have you ever seen a war being fought like this? We don’t know if we are here to assist the state police on law and order or to flush out Naxals, or merely to oscillate between troubled territories, getting our jawans (soldiers) killed for no fault of theirs.” [\\[xxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn29) He went on to point out various shortcomings including inadequate and sporadic rations, virtually no support for injured and killed soldiers, and points out that even “when I go on leave or when I am on my way back home \\[from camp\\], I travel that distance at the mercy of God or the Naxals. What morale are you talking about?” [\\[xxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn30) Despite their tactical capabilities, Maoists adhere to classic guerilla tactics, readily ceding territory in the face of organized state offensives, even “liberated areas” such as Lalgarh district. Their mobility and trans-bordered nature allows them to exploit weak intra-state cooperation, making border areas between states particularly troublesome. Some states such as Chhattisgarh have multiple tri-junctions – where the borders of three states meet – allowing insurgents to mount attacks across state lines before retreating to safe havens. [\\[xxxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn31) Success in one state – such as Andhra Pradesh – may only displace insurgents into others; the neighboring states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh have seen significant spikes in violence since. Several initiatives have been unveiled to overcome the jurisdictional conflicts that plague effective trans-border policing, most notably by creating unified commands in insurgency-affected states. Designed to act as ‘fusion centers’ to facilitate cooperation between states, between state and federal forces, and between civilian and military personnel, their result has so far been underwhelming, not least because of the pushback from many state and local governments. On the local level, a political-criminal interface ensures that many politicians are eager to collude with Maoists and profit from their control of mines and resources. In some states – such as Jharkhand and Bihar – political rivalries mean that states refuse to cooperate with federal efforts, and in others, leaders collude with the Maoists for self-preservation. In West Bengal, the state government has greatly slowed CI activity and all but allowed a Maoist sanctuary earning them greatly reduced levels of violence in the state, but damaging the overall COIN effort. [\\[xxxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn32) The easy availability of central forces has also resulted in many states neglecting their own police modernization efforts. Unsurprisingly, simply augmenting force numbers has not paid dividends. Chhattisgarh and Jharkand both saw insurgent attacks rise despite a police surge, whereas in Andhra Pradesh, the state which has most effectively combated Maoists, the police force in population terms remained constant. Credit for reversing insurgent momentum is generally given to the state’s elite ‘Greyhound’ force built to live and operate in the jungle as the guerilla did, and fight the Indian jungle equivalent of a “bush war.” The force’s 1,000 personnel across 30 “assault units,” benefited from rigorous training and superior equipment (particularly communications technology) and were able to rapidly deploy and effectively operate on Maoist terrain. The Greyhounds have been extremely effective, but they did not operate in a vacuum. Beyond elite forces, Andhra Pradesh pursued an effective state police capacity-building effort, spreading tactically trained personnel across the force, and building synergistic relationships between the district police, intelligence assets and the Greyhounds. [\\[xxxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn33) The state also benefited from focused efforts to improve its COIN doctrine. It coordinated police strategies, created fortified police districts in vulnerable areas, improved intelligence sharing between security agencies, [\\[xxxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn34) cross-trained regular police units with elite police commando forces, and measurably implemented well-crafted community development programs. Unfortunately through the militarized lens of India’s COIN campaign, only the warfighting elements of Andhra Pradesh’s strategy have been replicated with earnest. The CRPF is raising ten Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA) battalions to reach an envisioned end-strength of about 10,000 men. [\\[xxxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn35) COBRA battalions are expected to be some of the best-equipped paramilitary troops in the country, and are trained specifically for the Maoist fight. They are armed like a regular Army infantry platoon and are trained in counter-guerilla and jungle warfare operations at the elite Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS), the Indian Army’s premier unconventional warfare training institution. State police forces – such as the India Reserve (IR) battalions are also are tasked with raising two companies of specialized ‘commando’ forces per battalion [\\[xxxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn36) \\- and more state police forces are being given at least some advanced warfare training. This militarization of the police may yield results in terms of removing insurgents from the field, but comes with the tradeoff in diverting attention and resources away from the equally crucial task of increasing and professionalizing regular policing capacity to “hold” cleared territory. Another worrying trend has been the outsourcing of security responsibilities to auxiliary non-state militias that operate with little oversight, training or accountability, and yet are deputized under the aegis of ‘Special Police Officers’ (SPOs) with official government sanction. Most prominent was the Salwa Judum (literally translated to “Purification Hunt” in the local Gondi dialect), a Chhattisgarh government-sponsored and equipped militia of about 5,000 lightly armed tribal people. Salwa Judum may have benefited from support and funding from mining companies, and was widely accused of extreme human rights abuses including forcible displacements of villages, killings and rape. In response, in July 2011, the Indian Supreme Court declared SPOs illegal and unconstitutional and ordered their disbandment. Indian security officials had routinely justified these forces as helping them ‘localize’ their force presence, build up human intelligence networks and provide alternative employment opportunities for tribal youth. They came, however, with substantial tradeoffs including the militarization of tribal society and the emergence of ‘warlords’ who maintain control over refugee camps and swathes of territory – making disbandment and reintegration difficult. [\\[xxxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn37) However, despite their record, SPOs did provide an important “force multiplier” for culturally foreign CI forces, and their replacement with regular police will take time – by some accounts at least a year. [\\[xxxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn38) Moreover even if SPOs are abandoned fully – itself a dubious prospect – other shadowy vigilante groups also exist, including the several “Cobra” organizations in Andhra Pradesh that retaliate against Maoist violence, particularly if committed against military and government officials. [\\[xxxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn39) As detailed, Indian CI forces suffer many capacity shortfalls that impede their operational effectiveness, but major reforms are currently ongoing that could significantly increase the quality of anti-Maoist CI forces. Israeli assault rifles are being purchased, [\\[xl\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn40) helicopters being redeployed back from peacekeeping missions ostensibly for anti-Maoist operations, [\\[xli\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn41) and retired army soldiers being recruited as trainers. [\\[xlii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn42) Two of three sanctioned UAVs have been inducted to improve ISR capabilities and detect massed insurgent forces – although forested terrain restricts their utility [\\[xliii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn43) \\- and a variety of other new equipment is being inducted. All these if utilized effectively can improve the CI capacity to kill insurgents, but it is less certain that they can strategically end the insurgency. **Inadequate Social, Political and Economic Redress** The Indian state has focused on combating the insurgency by military means, but addressing the legitimate economic and social grievances of tribal peoples has been less forthcoming. Rural development in India comes with significant scale challenges, affecting 1/3rd of the entire world’s poor and traversing remote areas where the government has traditionally been absent. Improving tribal welfare is a component of the broader growth and modernization of India, and as such competes with a host of other priorities. Development projects come with sizeable time-lags that must be factored in – effective policy will require sustained funding and attention over a period of years without immediately apparent results. Development must be recognized for the offensive weapon that it is – both in attacking insurgent legitimacy and in binding tribals to the Indian state by destroying their earlier forms of social existence. [\\[xliv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn44) Moreover, it is not a panacea. Efforts to raise economic and human welfare standards must come alongside broader reforms in social justice and local governance to mitigate predatory and corrupt local administrative structures. It is not for nothing that the insurgent heartland in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand corresponds with the two worst governed states in the country. [\\[xlv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn45) Tighter regulation of private industry is also necessary, including measures to ensure rehabilitation for those displaced by mining projects, and efforts to compensate for and mitigate the ecological and social impacts of extraction. India has admittedly prioritized rural development – elevating its ministry to a cabinet level position in 2011 – and significantly increased allocations to Maoist-affected areas through targeted entitlements. However, rural development to date has been superficial and ineffective, with emphasis on increased allocations obscuring problems in implementation and a lack of progress towards desired outcomes. The Maoist Integrated Action Plan for example provided 250 million rupees in 2010, and 300 million in 2011 in discretionary funds for quick-impact human welfare projects including building facilities for drinking water, sanitation, health clinics, roads etc. Data to date, however, suggests that only a quarter of allocated money has been spent and only 15 percent of projects completed. [\\[xlvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn46) This is despite the obvious fact that sincere development is appreciated – in February 2011 the Maoist abduction of a district collector known for being an efficient and honest administrator led to tribal rallies and protests, forcing his release [\\[xlvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn47) There is, however, a prevalent belief that current patterns of insecurity dictate that stabilization must precede development. This is not an unreasonable view – it is obviously difficult to develop territory you do not control and the Maoists recognize that development can erode their control. As such, insurgents have targeted 1,241 ‘economic targets’ between 2007 and 2011, including roads, power plants, telephone towers etc. [\\[xlviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn48) Such targeting is entirely self-interested, seeking to keep communities isolated and insulated from the relief efforts and ensuring that Maoists are the sole providers of social services. Human Rights Watch for example details how Maoists shut down rural schools to create captive recruiting pools for their Bal Sangam child-brigades. [\\[xlix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn49) Government agents are prime Maoist targets, severely complicating outreach. CI forces have attempted to mitigate this problem by recently unveiling plans for seven new battalions of “specialized forces” that integrate engineering and security personnel. [\\[l\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn50) There are islands of success, but overall reconstruction and aid delivery efforts in Central India leave much to be desired. Plans look good on paper; the Saranda Action Plan for example seeks to build on successful clear operations with a series of entitlement plans – including issuing ration cards for the poor, creating rural work schemes and developing infrastructure to connect isolated communities. [\\[li\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn51) Unfortunately, many of these policies fail to be implemented effectively and a large proportion of allocated funds are leaked to inefficiency, corruption and the incompetence of the state machinery. Corruption in particular is not a side effect that can be ignored – the nexus between corrupt politicians, private industry and Maoists is a key driver of both tribal alienation from the state, as well as a major facilitator of insurgent freedom of action. Much development money is also believed to flow to Maoist hands in the form of protection money paid by reconstruction firms. **Lessons Learned** 1) Skewed priority of effort – The mission fails to integrate military and civilian efforts, and prioritizes tactical military decisions that may in many cases have strategic tradeoffs. Development and political outreach is tainted by police brutality, and ineffective military operations are a major driver of Maoist mobilization. Military missions must be designed and conducted carefully to minimize civilian alienation, and must be viewed as precursors for post-“clear” development and reconstruction. Civilian and military coordination must improve and emphasis must be placed on improving the conduct of security forces. 2) Over-Militarization of Police – The emphasis on building up paramilitary forces capable of taking the fight to the Maoists should not detract from efforts to build up competent civil police. Kinetic operations must be merely a prelude to a viable rule of law, which will require building up capacities in not just the civil police, but also the supporting justice and detention sectors. 3) Mobilize Scarce Assets – The Indian Army has rightly assessed that it is not trained or equipped to combat its own people, but it is the only Indian institution with the specialized capacity that could tip the Maoist fight. Aerial assets can improve ISR coverage, equipment such as counter-IED kits and armored vehicles can reduce police casualties, and Army trainers and facilities are the best available resource to build up small-unit combat capabilities and disseminate tactical lessons learnt from other theaters. 4) Improve unity of effort – The insurgency crosses borders, and so must the CI effort. Focus must be given to improving coordination between the many state and central agencies involved, and between states. The goal should be to create effective border management protocols that prevent insurgents from locating safe havens to regroup. 5) Attack insurgent legitimacy – CI actions should best sell their mission, but strategic communications can highlight Maoist complicity in corruption, extortion, and violent abuse at the expense of tribal communities. This is most viable if CI forces themselves adhere to tighter ethical codes of conducts than insurgents – not currently true. 6) Empower non-state actors with care – Actors such as Salwa Judum deeply de-legitimize the state and taint it by association. Especially in India, the population cannot easily distinguish between police branches or between formal and informal forces, and brutalities reinforce the predominant image of the Indian state as callous and predatory. 7) Improve the effectiveness of aid delivery – There must be a focus on outcomes over allocations. Emphasis should be paid on ensuring that projects are completed on time and to standard, and continual oversight should mitigate leakages. Projects should be visible and have immediate impact, and local communities must be involved from project design to completion. 8) Governance reform – Corruption and local predatory state structures are drivers of Maoist legitimacy and mobilization. A major facilitator of the insurgency is the willingness of local politicians to collude with Maoists and/or private industry at the expense of their constituents, and to enact self-interested policies that weaken the mission. Measures such as the sedition laws would be better suited to tackle direct support such as this, rather than human-right workers and ordinary civilians whose only crime is to extend moral support. 9) Aid is insufficient – Aid and quick-impact projects can only alleviate immediate needs. Broader economic and social reforms must be tackled with real urgency. A culture of impunity and blatant corruption must end; for politicians, police, and business elites, and inequalities between rich and poor and town and country must ease. Targeting Maoist-affected areas with increased funding and attention is probably good policy, but it is likely not an overstatement to say anti-Maoist success will correlate significantly with India’s progress in caring for its poorest peoples. * * * [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_ednref1) “Annual Report 2010-2011,” _Ministry of Home Affairs Republic Of India_, Available at [www.mha.nic.in](http://www.mha.nic.in/); “2010 bloodiest year for India’s Maoist rebellion,” _AFP,_ January 5, 2011.

    "full_text": "Since its independence in 1947, India has fought dozens of campaigns against four distinct and independent insurgencies on its soil—in Punjab, Kashmir, the Northeast, and the Maoist insurgents of central India—as well as one foreign campaign in Sri Lanka. While India has accumulated a wealth of counterinsurgency (COIN) experience that has varied in terms of terrain, insurgent goals, force structure(s), foreign involvement, and outcomes, most COIN scholars have focused on Western foreign incumbent experiences to the neglect of India and other indigenous incumbents.[1] Nevertheless, as both Iraq and Afghanistan move toward assuming greater responsibility for their internal security amidst continued insurgent activity, India’s COIN strategies can offer important lessons for these states and others that resemble its highly federalized political system, developing economy, and still evolving democracy. One analyst has argued that India has “one of the world’s most successful records in fighting insurgencies,” noting that “it has not yet lost a counterinsurgency campaign within the country.”[2] This claim, however, is puzzling given the current struggles of the Indian government to curb a raging Maoist insurgency. Today, while the insurgencies of the Northeast and Kashmir are largely contained, if not under control, and the Punjab insurgency soundly defeated, India has been earnestly testing different COIN strategies to combat a growing Maoist threat throughout its center and east known generally as the Naxalite insurgency. Since resurging in the last decade, the Naxalite uprising has been described by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as “a great national security threat” and the “biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”[3] This article will briefly describe some of the lessons of success and failure that can be drawn from India’s decades of COIN experience and their application in the current fight against the Naxalite insurgency. India’s Alternative Approach to COIN Generally speaking, the Indian take on COIN appears to depart from the approach advocated by Western doctrine that promotes a population-centric strategy to win “hearts and minds.”[4] Despite Indian official doctrine formally espousing this concept[5] and some contentions that India has always seen COIN as a “political rather than military problem,”[6] a closer look reveals that the Indian approach may be better characterized as a strategy of attrition[7] with the deployment of “raw state coercion”[8] and “enemy-centric” campaigns[9] to suffocate an insurgency through a “saturation of forces.”[10] At times it may involve the co-optation of elites to “buy-out” and contain an insurgency.[11] When the military has been deployed, it operates under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which includes “the power of the security forces to make preventative arrests, search premises without warrant, and shoot and kill civilians.”[12] In each major counterinsurgency campaign, the Indian state developed a number of innovative tactics and organizational capacities that yielded some success along with some negative fallout. During the Punjab campaign, India militarized the police and reversed their role with the military to harness local knowledge and legitimacy and lead kinetic operations.[13] As a result, the police structure remained highly militarized, bloated, inefficient, and incapable of investigative police work more than a decade later.[14] In Kashmir, the creation of a dedicated COIN force—the Rashtriya Rifles, integrating an army ethos into a paramilitary force especially equipped and trained to conduct counterinsurgency—achieved some success, but it ultimately had to be fully manned by army personnel and faced a number of operational and coordination problems with other forces.[15] The co-optation and transformation of insurgents into local assets was a tactic employed both in Punjab (called “CATs,” for Covert Apprehension Technique) and Kashmir (ikhwanis).[16] Turning insurgents was sometimes achieved through money[17] as well as abduction and torture,[18] but these tactics eventually led to new problems, such as increased criminal activity and corrupted security forces, for the respective governments.[19] Moreover, the highly kinetic approach of both campaigns entailed tremendous brutality, torture, disappearances, “encounter killings,” and mass graves that created a litany of human rights investigations and public disaffection, and today continues to fuel simmering resentment and potentially violence.[20] A slight variant of this approach—the buyout and political incorporation of insurgents—has enabled India to keep a lid on a whole host of insurgent separatist movements in the seven states of India’s eastern extremity, India’s Northeast, since 1956.[21] Yet while eliminating the prospect of separatism, it has perversely created spirals of insecurity, splinter groups (there are more than 100 distinct armed groups in the Northeast), and a dysfunctional insurgent political economy of violence, development aid, and interminable militia politics.[22] Overall, the Indian strategy of coercion, co-optation, and containment has achieved moderate success in mitigating the threat to the state, and this is being applied today against the re-emergent Naxalite insurgency. The Naxalite Insurgency The Naxalites first emerged in 1967 in the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal and spread throughout the central states of Bihar, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh until it was violently suppressed by state and paramilitary forces by 1972. This militant left-wing movement fractured into more than 40 distinct groups, which began to remobilize, consolidate and become more active in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly in the state of Andhra Pradesh.[23] Since 2004, with the merger of the two largest factions—the Peoples War Group and the Maoist Communist Center—to form the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-M), violence has climbed dramatically, with 2,200 incidents and 1,200 killed in 2010 alone.[24] It is estimated that Naxals have a presence in one-third of districts in India,[25] but with the strongest foothold in parts of seven states—West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The difference today is that this region also happens to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric potential.[26] While some parts of the left-wing movement in India are willing to partly or fully embrace parliamentary politics to address issues of class, inequality, and distribution, the hardcore Naxalites remain unwilling to countenance democratic politics and seek the violent overthrow of the state through a variety of tactics.[27] Although conventional accounts describe them as motivated by the broad economic deprivation and absence of the state in much of rural central India,[28] a more specific reason is resentment at the local exploitative power configurations—whether feudal landlords, land-expropriating state governments, or extractive corporations—that continue to dominate and suppress the lower castes and aboriginal tribes that reside in these areas and constitute the Naxalite support base.[29] The Naxalites, however, are a protean movement that has expertly exploited a variety of caste, ethnic, or sectarian cleavages in India.[30] Unlike some of the ethno-sectarian insurgencies of recent years, the Naxalite insurgency—posturing itself as a “people’s war”—comports more with classic COIN theory that was built on notions of competitive state building to address economic and governance deficiencies.[31] In step with their historical experience, however, the Indian state has generally favored a more kinetic approach to counterinsurgency over winning “hearts and minds.”[32] There appears to be an explicit awareness that the Western COIN model may not be the right fit for India. One Indian military analyst and practitioner praised the Andhra Pradesh approach for its “enemy-centric” character, an anathema in current Western COIN discourse.[33] Another well-regarded Indian analyst defended a kinetic focus and derided the hearts and minds “myth” by recalling that even Sir Gerald Templar regarded it as “that nauseating phrase I think I invented.”[34] Moreover, a well-known defense journalist wrote that a population-centric approach “has proved to be flawed.”[35] Indian State Response to the Naxalites State Strategies Given India’s federalist structure, the onus for responding to the rising Naxalite threat has fallen upon individual states, although with substantial federal support during the past five years.[36] The hardest hit states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh—where roughly half of Naxalite activity is concentrated and continues to escalate—have raced to scale up the manpower of their state and local police forces, while being supplemented with about 40 battalions of central paramilitary forces.[37] Meanwhile, states such as Bihar and West Bengal have also seen a rise in violence in recent years as their police manpower has declined or held steady. The composition of police is another variable that may adversely affect outcomes. The police forces of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Orissa are composed of a much higher percentage of paramilitary forces (as opposed to civil police) relative to the Indian average, potentially rendering them less locally knowledgeable or legitimate.[38] Central and state governments have been criticized for their paramilitary forces’ shortfalls in size, antiquated organizational structure and age profile, inadequate training (for instance, only firing 20 rounds per year), and most importantly the absence of coordination or a coherent strategy.[39] The Limits of Indian Responses True to its past history, the Indian central and state governments’ COIN responses have been heavily kinetic, disregarding local public perceptions. One Indian commentator wrote, “exceeding Maoist rebels they accuse of brutality, the police, paramilitary and Salwa Judum recruits continue to freely kill unarmed men and women. It has wrecked any short- to medium-term hope of winning tribals and forest dwellers back to the fold of the state.”[40] With the launch of additional major sweep operations and expansion of commando units, collateral damage of civilians caught in the crossfire and through retribution is expected to rise.[41] Violence, whether premeditated or spontaneous, “can be completely indiscriminate, leading to the burning of the homes of innocents and their torture, maiming, rape, and death.”[42] While there have been centralized efforts to coordinate the use of force and economic development, these have largely faltered due to poor coordination, misutilization, and co-optation by local elites and corporations.[43] The Indian government has repeatedly set up unified commands to better coordinate the use of central paramilitary forces, state armed (paramilitary) police, and state local or civil police, but these have been riddled with problems and at times hindered local innovation.[44] A major attempt was launched with Operation Green Hunt in late 2009, a massive search-and-destroy operation meant to clear out the Naxalite strongholds in the forests of central India. The fissures of this unified command, however, were exposed when a company of central paramilitary forces short on local police support and intelligence were ambushed and more than 80 killed after being tracked for three days by Naxalite insurgents.[45] The two states that appear to be relatively successful at reducing insurgent activity or keeping it at bay are Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra seems to have had a relatively higher police to population ratio at the beginning of the decade, potentially buffering it from the spillover of Naxalite insurgency from neighboring areas. While Andhra Pradesh’s manpower ratio rose somewhat over the past decade, its success in dramatically reducing Naxalite activity in its territory is generally attributed by Indian analysts to a rather different strategy of raising a special commando force known as the Greyhounds.[46] The Greyhound Force The Greyhound force, an elite anti-Maoist commando unit, was raised beginning in 1987 from within the Andhra Pradesh police to conduct small unit counterguerrilla offensives against Naxalite insurgents.[47] Roundly believed to have been tremendously successful, the Andhra Pradesh police have drawn inspiration from the infamous Selous Scouts of Rhodesia to prosecute the equivalent of a “bush war” against the Naxalites.[48] The 2,000-strong Greyhound force is better paid and equipped than federal or state paramilitary forces with state of the art weapons and technology, better trained in jungle warfare, and moves in nimbler, highly capable units to target, track, and destroy insurgent networks by modeling guerrilla tactics.[49] The Greyhounds are also well supported by the entire state police force.[50] Two companies of Greyhounds would be deployed at a joint operational base with two platoons of local home guards for intelligence and logistical support.[51] Between 2005 and 2008, they have been credited with bringing down the Maoist cadre in Andhra Pradesh from 1,200 to 500 and Naxalite activity in the state this decade has dropped from a peak of roughly 600 attacks in 2003 to around 100 in 2010.[52] Their success was attributed to signals intelligence exploitation, careful operational planning, jungle survival training, night operations, and decapitation of Maoist leadership.[53] The Greyhound model is perceived to be so successful that many states are starting to develop their own small unit commando police battalions. While the Indian central government continues to pour central paramilitary forces into the region (now on the order of about 70 battalions), it is also raising 10 Commando Battalions for Resolute Action (CoBRA) and deploying them alongside state and federal units.[54] Yet one should be leery of the triumphant claims made of Andhra Pradesh as well as the potential to model the Greyhound success. First, there is reason to believe that the Greyhounds did not defeat the Maoist insurgents outright but merely displaced them to neighboring states. This corresponds with data that shows Naxalite activity skyrocketed in neighboring Chhattisgarh as it declined in Andhra Pradesh.[55] Second, intelligence officers and other analysts believe gains in Andhra Pradesh are unsustainable and the state remains highly vulnerable to Maoist activity.[56] This fear was validated by a recent Times of India-IMMRB survey of five northern districts of Andhra Pradesh recently cleared of Maoist insurgents where the majority of those surveyed still sympathized with Naxalite motives, methods, and results, and viewed actions by state forces such as encounter killings as suspect and unjustified. Meanwhile, a plurality believed nothing had improved and exploitation had increased since their departure.[57] Even if the Naxalite presence and violence has been structurally reduced, the survey revealed that the strategy has certainly not relied upon winning hearts and minds to achieve this end. Finally, even if the Greyhound approach was actually successful, the background conditions required to achieve operational effectiveness are currently absent or underdeveloped in the rest of the country. Andhra Pradesh began raising the Greyhounds in 1987 but did not achieve marked success until almost two decades later. Despite the state having a relatively efficient policing system, both the Greyhound commandos and the state police and security force serving as the logistical and intelligence “tail” took substantial time to mature.[58] New police inductees served first in the Greyhound support unit for about four years before rotating to the district level where they might continue to support operations.[59] This gradually built up inter-organizational familiarity and cooperation within the state, and the substantial network of well-trained local police—features noticeably absent in the rest of Naxal-affected India—were able to funnel high quality intelligence for Greyhound targeting.[60] Conclusion Three points are worth noting about Indian counterinsurgency strategy. First, rather than abiding by a singular formula, strategies have varied over time and space depending on the context and nature of the insurgency. Second, India has routinely departed from the traditional “hearts and minds” or population-centric COIN for a highly kinetic and coercive enemy-centric COIN. Third, Indian successes are never “clean” and always involve uncomfortable tradeoffs, whether by way of criminal activity, organizational dysfunction and corruption, or further insurgency. These should all be expected as India faces down the Naxalite insurgency over what might be a full decade or more.[61] This third point is in part related to India’s democratic character. The mobilization capacity of insurgents creates perverse interests by political parties to harness these assets for their own ends.[62] In fact, for much of the earlier part of this decade, most Naxal-affected states “abdicated their authority over vast regions, as long as the semblance of normalcy could be maintained and the electoral interests of the dominant political party could be taken care of.”[63] Moreover, Indian counterinsurgency has been and will likely continue to look both brutal and incomplete (by Western standards) because the incumbent is unwilling to countenance the types of institutional overhauls needed to fully quell insurgent impulses. If the fundamental conflict is not over the distribution of resources that can be mended with economic development, but rather the distribution of power controlled by the state and elite cadres, then the disease is the system.[64] The cure then may deeply threaten not only India’s growth engine that has relied upon land appropriation and displacement for industrialization and mining, but also the power, composition, and identity of the Indian state stretching from the local level up to the state and national governments.

Achuthan, “Tackling Maoists: The Andhra Paradigm,” Indian Defence Review 25:2 (2010). [27] Naxalite insurgents have targeted “class enemies” (sometimes through beheadings), police and security forces, infrastructure such as police stations, schools, local government buildings, roads, power lines, railways, and economic targets like mining and energy infrastructure. They have been able to carry out these activities through the acquisition as well as indigenous production of a wide variety of weapons including automatic firearms, rocket launchers, and a whole host of mines for which they use to conduct IED attacks and small unit ambushes. See Ramana; Achuthan; Sudeep Chakravarti, “No End in Sight,” Seminar 605 (2010). The Naxalites are also reported to provide public goods to local residents such as security, swift justice in “people’s courts,” education, irrigation, community kitchens, medical units, and minimum wage enforcement in part through extortion and taxation of local government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists. See Bedi; Oetken; Chakravarti; Pratul Ahuja and Rajat Ganguly, “The Fire Within: Naxalite Insurgency Violence in India,” Small Wars and Insurgencies 18:2 (2007). [28] For example, the Ministry of Home Affairs Annual Report from 2006-07 states, “Naxalites typically operate in a vacuum created by inadequacy of administrative and political institutions, espouse local demands and take advantage of the prevalent disaffection, perceived injustice among the underprivileged and remote segments of population.” Also see “India’s Naxalites: A Spectre Haunting India,” Economist, August 17, 2006; Vani K.

It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

Its four primary partners, U.S. Pacific Command, Tripler Army Medical Center, the University of Hawaii and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention act collectively to support a body of operational research. Disaster Response in India represents the first product of these efforts. The Center of Excellence, a unique and forward-thinking partnership, acts as a facilitator among the many organizations which are critical players in the delivery of disaster management, relief and recovery. Its research mission cuts across organizational boundaries and thus the Center is able to identify proposals of universal benefit. Focusing through a collaborative lens allows the Center to work with more appropriate, multi-pronged approaches leveraged across civilian, military and private partnerships. The commitment to support operational research in a variety of fields and disciplines - from public and mental health issues in refugee populations to re-establishing functioning infrastructure in devastated communities - evolved from the core purposes of the Center, which is to bring together the best individuals and organizations who are dedicated to improving the world’s ability to respond to natural and complex humanitarian events. The authors’ work herein, the culmination of many hours of intensive labor, contributes to an appreciation of foreign disaster management processes, encourages international cooperation, and supports disaster management institutions and professionals in all countries and regions. To conduct and publish findings as these is of benefit to all peoples. In our shrinking, interdependent world, the drop of even a small stone in one place leads to ripples felt in the most remote corners of the world. It is our hope that this document will see widespread distribution, and through extensive use that it be passed along to colleagues as a tome on the topic. Fredrick M.

The number has been increasing every year because of the mixture of various factors such as adverse weather, population growth, urbanization, and industrialization. How the Republic of India organizes for managing significant natural and man-made disasters, its capacity for effective response, and its ability to achieve unity of effort among governmental and non-governmental organizations are the elements of analysis here. This is of interest because India is an emerging world power; it is currently the second largest country in the world in population, and by 2050 it will have surpassed China as the largest. The number of Indians affected by disaster events shows a steady upward trend. Disasters have been taking a heavy toll of human and animal lives. Floods have proven to be the most devastating type of natural disaster in India, causing the maximum number of deaths and damage to property (cyclones have taken a heavy toll of lives and caused widespread devastation). At the same time, droughts affect a large segment of population, resulting in loss of employment and migration to other regions. Earthquakes have caused a comparatively lower amount of damage, but landslides are likely to increase in frequency in the coming years because of deforestation and over development on hillsides. Conurbation and industrialization have combined to create a dangerous synergy that now presents a significant hazard to India’s people. In responding to these kinds of hazards, India’s disaster management officials and professional humanitarians conduct disaster planning and response generally within a paradigm of three phases: Pre-disaster; Emergency (or Disaster Impact); Post Disaster(or Recovery). There is a strong emphasis in government policy and planning to encourage mitigation, i.e., actions taken prior to the occurrence of a disaster, including preparedness and long-term risk reduction measures. 1 Elephants on the Rajpath Defending Rashtrapati Bhavan (President’s Palace) To encourage effective training, coordination and planning for disaster response, the Government of India established in 1995 a National Center for Disaster Management; and in 1998, India’s Minister for Agriculture announced the formation of a National Commission on Disaster Management. These will facilitate the evolution of a National Disaster Management Plan. The Plan is now under development and is expected to be completed in 2001. RESPONSE SYSTEM Under India’s federal system, the states have responsibility for disaster response. When the disasters is severe or spread over several states, the Central Government supplements the efforts of state governments by providing financial and material assistance. Government policy response to a natural calamity is provided by the Prime Minister, Cabinet Committees and the Agriculture Minister. The objectives of policy response are to address the sufferings of the people affected by the natural calamity. A policy response often leads to visits to the calamity affected areas by President, Prime Minister and other dignitaries; setting up machinery for implementing, reviewing and monitoring the relief measures; and activating the administrative response process for assistance in relief measures. The state governments in India are autonomous in organizing relief operations in the event of natural disaster and also for purposes of long term preparedness and rehabilitation measures. The states deal with natural disasters through their Revenue Departments or Relief Organizations. 2 REVENUE Division Commissioner DISTRICT MAGISTRATE Divisional Sub-Divisional MAGISTRATE TEHSILDARS PATEL OR PATWARI (POLICY AND PLANNING) (CONTROL ROOM) (DISTRICT) (SUB-DIVISION) (TEHSIL) (VILLAGE) OTHER DEPARTMENTS POLICE HOME GUARD CIVIL DEFENSE STATE CRISIS MANAGEMENT GROUP EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER RELIEF COMMISSIONER STATE GOVERNMENT CHIEF SECRETARY TYPICAL ORGANIZATION FOR STATE EMERGENCY The states also have a State Crisis Management Group (SCMG) which functions under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary and/or Relief Commissioner. The Group comprises senior officers from the departments of revenue and relief, home, civil supplies, power, irrigation, water supply, local self government (panchayat), agriculture, forests, rural development, health, planning, public works and finance. States develop the contingency plans for disaster response and long-term strategies for mitigation. The state response plan identifies the functional areas such as relief, communications, information, transport, health services, etc. and proposes assignments to the various departments. The plan also lays down preparedness checklists, operating procedures and reporting formats. The state mitigation strategy argues for better land use management, building codes, traffic standards, health standards, and so on. These objectives are to be secured through disaster legislation, mitigation regulation, and incentives for mitigation. The State Relief Commissioner establishes an Emergency Operations Center (Control Room) as soon as disaster situation develops. The Center collects and disseminates the latest information on forecasting and warning of disaster, and functions as the focal point for coordinating disaster relief efforts with the other concerned departments. THE FIRST RESPONDERS Every state is divided into a number of districts. The head of the district administration is known as the District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner. (In some states, he is better known as the Collector). The District Magistrate is in charge of all the relief measures at the district level. The State government routes its instructions through him, and the District Magistrate ensures that the total efforts of the district are geared in a coordinated manner to providing disaster relief to the people. Sometimes, in emergency situations, the District Magistrate’s powers are enhanced with a view to ensuring complete unison in the efforts of all the concerned departments. A district is further sub-divided into sub-divisions and tehsils. The head of the sub-division is called a Sub-Divisional Officer or Deputy Collector while the tehsil is headed by an officer called the Tehsildar. The lowest unit of administration is the village whose revenue matters are attended to by a functionary known as Patel or Patwari. These lower tiers of administration provide the first responders that do the work, and 3 they are a critically important source of leadership during disaster events. When disaster strikes, the District Magistrate activates his contingency plan with the help of Control Room staff who monitor rescue and relief efforts. Also assisting is the District Relief Committee which includes local representatives of the people, members of the legislative assembly and the parliament. Through these mechanisms, the District Magistrate coordinates with central government authorities and defense forces, and he synchronizes the voluntary efforts of NGOs with the efforts of the district administration. THE NGOS India has a strong tradition of voluntary organizations responding to any calamity or disaster overwhelming the people. The voluntary organizations offer immediately available communications within the disaster affected community, technical services, manpower, and financial support. Services provided by the NGOs include awareness and information campaigns, training for local volunteers, immediate rescue and first aid, psychological aid, food, water, medicine, other materials, sanitation and hygiene, damage assessment, reconstruction and financial aid. The 1998 cyclone in Gujarat provides some idea of the scope of NGO emergency assistance during a disaster event in India: • CARE-India: food for two months and 350 tents worth Rs. 700,000; • CARITAS: housing reconstruction; • Catholic Relief Service: $10,000 for shelter and drinking water, and 161 tonnes of food supplies; • The Discipleship Center: plastic sheets, utensils, bed sheets, sarees, dhotis, and children’s clothing; • OXFAM: food grains, plastic sheets, clothing; • World Vision:roof tiles, wood materials for home reconstruction. India prefers not to request disaster assistance in any formal way from donor nations or international organizations. Its stated policy is that India will rely on its own resources to resolve disaster situations. But it is difficult to imagine disaster relief operations without the 4 contributions of the international and India-based NGOs. To avoid being at cross purposes with Indian policy, international organizations and donor nations usually provide disaster assistance resources to local level governments and grass-roots organizations via on-site NGOs. DISASTER RESPONSE AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE Disaster events in recent years have placed great demands on India’s disaster management system, and the year 1998 was a particularly bad one for the country. Floods affected several states. A cyclone of severe intensity devastated Gujarat. Landslides took a heavy toll of human lives in the hill regions of Uttar Pradesh. The Orissa cyclone of 1999 was the greatest natural disaster the country has faced in the 20th century. These hazards illustrate the magnitude of the challenge. Floods There were unprecedented rains in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir in September 1988. In Kapurthala district, the water from Beas river submerged about 150 villages under 8 to 12 feet of water. In Jalandhar, fifty per cent of the standing crops were destroyed. In Ropar, thousands of people were trapped in flood waters and had to spend several nights on the rooftops of their houses. Gurdaspur town had two to four feet of water. The Government of India formed a Crisis Management Group under the chairmanship of the Relief Commissioner. The Armed Forces helped to evacuate people, and provided air, land and water transportation. A voluntary body known as Flood Relief Society was formed with Justice Ajit Singh Bains, a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, as Chairman to provide relief to the flood affected people of Punjab. The Society made Sikh and Hindu temples the focal points for collecting relief material. In Himachal Pradesh, Kinnaur, Una, Chamba, Kulu and Shimla were badly affected. More than a dozen bridges in different parts of the State collapsed, and about two thousand persons were marooned in the Pong dam area. Una was completely cut off. People living in Chamba along the Ravi river had to be shifted to safer places. The Border Security Forces personnel were marooned at their outposts. Thein dam was threatened. The Grand Trunk Road between Beas, Rayya and Khalichain was submerged under three to four feet of water. 5 Over 405 thousand cubic feet per second (cusecs) of water was flowing in river Sutlej on September 24 against its capacity of 305 thousand cusecs. There was panic about the safety of the Bhakra Dam. The reservoir attained the highest ever level of 1687.47 ft., which was above the maximum storage level designed for the dam. The Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) released the extra water without bothering about the capacity of the reservoirs below. The BBMB did not warn the district authorities or the people before releasing the water. People in areas downstream were caught unawares–aggravating the magnitude of the disaster. There was loss of life and property on a massive scale. In northern areas of India, catchment areas have deteriorated due to increasing deforestation and urbanization leading to the reservoirs getting silted, their storage capacity reduced, and life span cut short. The 1998 floods also affected large areas of northern and eastern states with Upper Assam being the worst affected. Nearly 5,000 villages were submerged, and a total of 3.6 million people were affected by the fury of the Brahmaputra river. Majuli, the largest river island in the world, was completely submerged and over 100,000 people living on the island had to be evacuated. In West Bengal, more than half the total population of Malda were rendered homeless–1.5 million people. Large areas of Murshidabad were inundated by the Bhagirathi river. Army and the Border Security Force personnel assisted the State administration in the rescue and relief operations. The Navy also sent boats and a team of 50 people including doctors to Malda. In Bihar, a total of nearly 12 million people in over 7,200 villages in 28 districts in north and central Bihar were affected. Army personnel assisted in relief works in Katihar and Darbhanga districts. There were floods in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya also. The severity of flooding in these states was comparatively less in the strategic sense, but no less serious to the victims. Cyclones in Gujarat and Orissa Gujarat state was lashed by a severe cyclonic storm on June 9, 1998. About 1,250 people were killed while over one thousand were reported missing. There was devastation on a large scale in the districts of Kutch, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Porbandar, Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Banaskantha, Surat, Bharuch, Valsad and Navsari. Nearly 66 hectares of agricultural land was eroded and thousands of trees were uprooted. 6 The gateway along the Gulf of Kutch became a graveyard of vessels with 40 ships having run aground and five of them actually sinking. The Gujarat government reacted with a “caterpillar-like pace,” according to India Today magazine. In the State Assembly, the Congress members, during discussions on the tragedy, harped on the point that a majority of lives lost on June 9, 1998 along the Saurashtra-Kutch coastline could have been saved had the State Government implemented a sound disaster management plan. The Union Home Minister conceded that the cyclone forecast of the Meteorological Department had gone awry as there was no mention in its forecast that Kutch district, which was worst affected, would be hit. There was also lack of communication between the Kandla Port Trust Authorities and the district administration. It also came to light that the Kandla Port Trust had been repeatedly warned about the consequences of tampering with coastal ecosystems and building too many new projects in the Kandla Port area. Political considerations had led to project after project being cleared. The Government of Gujarat had even altered the Coastal Management Plan to facilitate projects in the Coastal Regulation Zone. In recent years, construction of chemical facilities, petroleum complexes, cement factories, ports and jetties had stripped the coastal natural barriers formed by coral outcrops, sand banks, mangrove plants and dunes. Nothing remained to impede the 200 km/h cyclonic winds and four-meter tidal waves—a large number of innocents died. In response, the Government of India decided to give assistance to the maritime states in the Ninth Plan for the protection of critical reaches of coastal areas. Under this scheme, the coastal areas would be protected by constructing sea walls. The Coastal Protection and Development Advisory Committee has prepared a comprehensive National Coastal Protection Project estimated to cost Rs. 16 billion. The cyclone which lashed Orissa on October 29, 1999 has been described by Sitakant Mahapatra as “perhaps the greatest tragedy Orissa has faced since the Kalinga war that converted... Ashoka to Buddhism.” The death toll was over 10,000 and the total loss of property has been estimated at Rs. 10 billion. Landslides On August 18, 1998, a massive landslide wiped out the entire Malpa village in the Pithoragarh district of Uttar Pradesh, killing about 210 people. Earlier, 76 people were killed in devastating landslides in the 7 Ukhimath block of Rudraprayag district on August 12. There were landslides in the Ukhimath area again on August 19, killing 26 people. A total of nearly 400 people are estimated to have been killed and 12 villages were wiped out in a series of landslides spread over a period of ten days in the hill regions of Uttar Pradesh. A team of 200 personnel from the Army, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Pradeshik Armed Constabulary and Border Security Force was rushed to Malpa to carry out the relief operations. The State Government announced an ex gratia of Rs. one hundred thousand each to the next of kin of those killed in the tragedy, Rs. 50,000.00 each to the injured, and Rs. 25,000.00 for the reconstruction of damaged houses. The community response was spontaneous. A correspondent who toured the region commented that the Ukhimath community set a stellar example in altruism. Every family fed at least one person affected by the landslides. “We take it that every family has one more member to look after,” as a student of the Garhwal University said. The Yuvak Mangal Dal and the Mahila Mangal Dal, voluntary associations of youth and women in the region, did yeoman’s service in rushing to the unsafe areas with succor. The Himalayan Environment Studies and Conservation Organization, an NGO, sent medicines and relief materials. In spite of recurring landslides in the region, adequate attention has not been paid to planning and preventative measures. The cumulative effects of deforestation, erosion, water-logging, salinity and nutrient depletion all over the country have led to a loss of approximately Rs.232 billion. Technological Disaster–Long-term Effects Remain The Bhopal gas tragedy, which took place on December 3, 1984, was the worst technological disaster of the country. It was the result of faulty design, poor maintenance and unsatisfactory plant operation. Union Carbide, a U.S.-based multinational company, had a plant manufacturing Sevin and other pesticides at Bhopal. On the night of December 2, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas escaped into Bhopal’s night air. It is estimated that as as many as 18,000 human deaths resulted from the incident, and large numbers of livestock perished. Today, some 15 years after the event, relatively few people have been properly compensated for their losses, and there are perhaps as many as 125,000 people who are in an acute state of ill health as a result of a whole range of diseases like breathlessness, eye problems, 8 neurological disorders, menstrual and other reproductive abnormalities, anxiety, depression and obstructive pulmonary disease. The Bhopal experience has provided a number of lessons, such as the need to regulate the growth of industries producing hazardous products. The most important of these is suggested by Dr. R. B. Sharma, Director of the Disaster Management Institute in Bhopal: The basic point of disaster management recovery is the human dimension. We are too concerned with the material. There is little attention to what happens after the disaster. The cyclones, earthquakes, floods, and landslides of 1998 and 1999, as well as the lingering effects of the Bhopal tragedy, suggest the grand dimensions of India’s disaster management challenge. It also suggests the capabilities and capacities for disaster management in India today. THE FUTURE FOR INDIA’S DISASTER MANAGEMENT The overall trend is towards more disaster-related deaths and losses. Some reasons for this are: • Continuing population growth which will overload the available infrastructure and services, even without the advent of disasters; • Increasing pressure on a land that will have to feed the world’s most populous nation but, year after year, is vulner\u0002able to the vagaries of weather; • Uneven economic growth that may result in a better life for some sectors while leaving oth\u0002ers destitute and unable to ward off hazards; • Interdependence of countries and regions whereby hazards in one region impact directly on others, such as low-land flooding caused by denudation of upland forests, or a nuclear accident in one region which casts fallout on another. 9 Bhopal: The Union Carbide Plant as it Appears Today. Experience shows that in the event of a disaster, the government response is generally tardy. Critics suggest that this is because the bureaucracy, which was once considered the “steel frame” of administration, has over the years become inefficient and corrupt. Millions are spent on flood protection schemes and drought relief measures, but only a fraction really shows. Analyzing disaster management in India, Times of India commentator Rajiv Desai recently wrote: Lives are lost, families ruined and property is destroyed. The only survivors are those who govern: politicians, bureaucrats and their retinue. ...no one is held accountable for public safety. Thus, the very minimum requirement of governance is waived. Never mind disaster management, the government itself is the disaster. The Government of India has the requisite structure to cope with disasters. There are detailed orders and manuals on related subjects, particularly at the state level. However, the Central Government has yet to publish a national emergency management plan and lacks the formal and official framework for strategic guidance and doctrinal development. Nevertheless, the confluence of effort by professionals associated with organizations such as the National Center for Disaster Management, Disaster Management Institute, Indira Gandhi National Open University, and so on, has developed a body of knowledge relevant to India’s situation. The universal themes which have evolved from this effort suggest the following doctrinal imperatives for future initiatives: • A strong focus on disaster prevention and mitigation; • Long-term measures to fight earthquake–economic and technical effort; • Control of economic development to reduce the impact on the land and resulting changes to the flow of water run-off; • Setaside funding by the states for disaster emergencies, aug\u0002mented by Central Government grants; • The need for networking among disaster management organiza\u0002tions, government agencies, and non-government volunteer or\u0002ganizations; 10 • An emphasis on training and publishing the professional body of knowledge; • Emphasis on the human dimension of disasters, particularly the social, medical, and psychological aspects of long-term recovery. Given India’s constitutional guidelines of state responsibility for disaster management, a ponderous bureaucracy, an historical preference for devolving responsibility to regional levels of government, it seems likely that India’s forthcoming National Disaster Management Plan will provide generalized policy constructs. The locus of disaster prevention and relief will remain with state governments, with the primary burden carried by the District Magistrate. Under siege by the current onslaught of cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides, nuclear weapons bring an added dimension to India’s disaster management challenge. The confrontation between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir problem poses a proximate threat to peace and stability in the sub-continent. The acquisition of nuclear capability by both India and Pakistan has added a new and unwanted component to disaster prevention and assistance. As some Indian disaster specialists suggest, there remains some comfort in what seems to be India’s almost unlimited capacity to absorb shocks. There have been waves of invasion from across the north-west frontier through the centuries, but the spirit of India was never vanquished. India always reasserted itself, and with this spirit of certitude India will approach the coming challenges of disaster response in the new millennium. 11",

Reached after years of negotiations to resolve a military standoff that began in eastern Ladakh, the agreement is a testament to the complex yet critical nature of bilateral ties between the two Asian giants and appears to have thawed the otherwise fraught relationship. The two countries [held 21 rounds of corps commander level meetings](https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/37645/21st+round+of+IndiaChina+Corps+Commander+Level+Meeting) seeking complete disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and restoration of normalcy and peace. The pact allows for the [resumption of patrols](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-china-have-arrived-border-patrolling-pact-indias-top-diplomat-says-2024-10-21/) along the [disputed border](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-china-complete-80-90-pc-disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh/articleshow/114696063.cms?from=mdr), enabling both states to underscore their territorial claims while ensuring adherence to the agreed terms. While the triangular dynamics between India, China, and Pakistan have been complex, the India-Pakistan [ceasefire](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/world/asia/pakistan-india-ceasefire.html) in 2021 left India to largely focus on its standoff along the LAC and broader competition with China. The resolution of this border standoff indicates that India’s threat perception of China have shifted beyond a purely security calculus to focus on other considerations, such as the resumption of economic ties, and operate independently of its relationship with the United States. However, even though this agreement assuages India’s perceptions of a two-front threat, tensions between India and Pakistan will still persist. The resolution of this border standoff indicates that India’s threat perception of China have shifted beyond a purely security calculus to focus on other considerations, such as the resumption of economic ties, and operate independently of its relationship with the United States. ## Terms of the Agreement The agreement [includes](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-india-china-border-patrol-agreement-and-why-it-is-important-6844560) provisions for both countries to withdraw troops from specific areas of contention along the LAC, to avert risks of any further confrontations. It also outlines structured patrolling arrangements, intended to maintain the status quo and prevent any unilateral changes to the LAC. The agreement also calls for a continuous monitoring system to verify the status of troop withdrawal and patrolling activities, outlining a framework for resolving any future disagreements or stand-offs through dialogue at various levels, from local military commanders to diplomatic channels. It also acknowledges that the broader territorial dispute remains unresolved and opens the door for continued diplomatic engagement to resolve these longstanding issues. The timing of the announcement by India and China – just before both countries were set to attend the [BRICS summit](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/22/russias-brics-summit-whats-on-the-agenda-and-why-does-it-matter) – is noteworthy. The subsequent meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the summit materialized their political alignment to ease tensions and pave the way for improved political and economic ties. ## Impact on India’s Threat Perceptions While there is a sense of relief that the standoff – which had escalated tensions and led to the loss of lives – has moved towards [de-escalation](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg0gwy0nlyo), there is skepticism concerning the agreement’s durability, especially given Indian mistrust of Beijing due to previous [India-China](https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/Bilateral-Brief-Updated_21-August-2023.pdf) border disputes. Thus, the agreement might not necessarily indicate that India and China have completely moved past historical grievances, especially since the lack of detailed public information on the deal’s terms suggests that negotiations may still be ongoing. However, overall, the agreement suggests a shift in India’s perception of China as a threat. A stabilized border [frees up resources](https://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-china-defrost-ties-at-brics-summit-key-expectations-34920.html/) and fosters economic growth. China is India’s [largest trading partner](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/china-beats-us-to-emerge-as-largest-trading-partner-of-india-in-fy24-gtri-124051200126_1.html), and trade between the two countries [surged](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/indias-top-trade-partner-china-regains-spot-on-higher-imports-9324553/) from USD $65 billion in 2020 to over USD $118 billion in 2024. India [relies on Chinese imports](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-23-times-in-15-years-indias-chinese-import-bill-to-rise-further/article68118302.ece) for industrial goods, electronics, machinery, and pharmaceuticals, highlighting the mutual economic reliance that complicates their outright rivalry. In fact, both states have signaled with this agreement that they prioritize pragmatic reasons to seek a temporary peace over strategic concerns. For China, it may diffuse some of the [economic and diplomatic pressure](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/india-china-ties-at-a-crossroads-as-security-economic-pressures-clash-3201218) from the unresolved conflict along the LAC coupled with a slowing domestic economy, real-estate challenges, and Western restrictions on Chinese goods. By easing relations with India, China also seeks to prevent New Delhi from imposing further restrictions on Chinese investments or hardening existing policies. The agreement signals to the West that bloc politics is rendered void when economic considerations come into play. ## U.S. Factor and Triangular Dynamics The border agreement poses a significant question as to its potential impact on the budding relationship between the United States and India. Since the early 2000s, the U.S.-India partnership has [deepened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/21/joint-fact-sheet-the-united-states-and-india-continue-to-expand-comprehensive-and-global-strategic-partnership/), especially considering India’s participation in initiatives like [the Quad](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/tag/the-quad-alliance-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/) and [I2U2](https://www.state.gov/i2u2/). Their cooperation in the realms of defense, technology, and economic issues reflects shared concerns over China’s regional assertiveness. Consequently, India’s agreement to this deal with China demonstrates India’s desire to bolster its economy, its self-confidence in taming its strong neighbor and securing its borders, and practicing an independent foreign policy from the United States. While India has indicated that it intends to keep working with the United States, its individual handling of its border crisis with China exhibits its desire to keep a multialigned foreign policy. Although the United States applauded the pullback of Chinese and Indian forces from the border, it underlined that it had [no role](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/us-india-china-border-breakthrough-ladakh-standoff-patrolling-deal-resolution-2625358-2024-10-30) in resolving the India-China border dispute. Nonetheless, the improvement in the India-China relationship may also benefit the United States by reducing the risk of conflict in South Asia and allowing for Washington to focus on China’s role in other regions around the world. ## What About Pakistan? The India-China border agreement has a mixed impact on Pakistan **.** Reduced tensions between New Delhi and Beijing facilitate an environment of peace in the region, which bodes well for Islamabad. However, the success of India’s negotiations with China does not indicate a similar improvement in the India-Pakistan relationship. The possibility of any analogous border agreement on the LOC is fraught with challenges that are multifaceted and deeply entrenched, primarily revolving around territorial disputes over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism. However, the success of India’s negotiations with China does not indicate a similar improvement in the India-Pakistan relationship. The possibility of any analogous border agreement on the LOC is fraught with challenges that are multifaceted and deeply entrenched, primarily revolving around territorial disputes over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism. Despite Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar’s [recent visit to Islamabad](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/s-jaishankars-historic-visit-to-pakistan-sco-meeting-internet-calls-him-boss-the-real-hero/articleshow/114249012.cms?from=mdr) for a conclave SCO meeting, his visit did not pertain to the bilateral relationship and has not shown any signs of purposefully engaging to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and other lingering bilateral issues. Strategically, India’s construction of the [INS Varsha, the development of K-4 naval capabilities in the eastern coast](https://issi.org.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IB_Abu_Hurrairah_July_15_2024.pdf), and its cooperation with the U.S.’s Indo-Pacific Strategy raises concerns for Pakistan’s strategic threat perceptions regardless of the border agreement. Nonetheless, reduced tensions on the LAC may ease India’s threat perceptions of a two-front challenge from China and Pakistan, which could indirectly suggest greater Indian appetite for enduring crisis risks on the LOC. In conclusion, the recent India-China border agreement is a positive development in the short term that provides a framework for de-escalation and the resumption of normal patrolling activities. However, the long-term prospects for peace and stability will depend on continuous efforts to address the underlying issues and build a durable framework for conflict resolution and cooperation. The world awaits to see if this agreement will be a harbinger of a new era in India-China relations or just another interlude in a long-standing rivalry. ## Recent & Related Video [South Asian Perspectives on Critical Cyber Threats, Law, and Norms](https://www.stimson.org/2025/south-asian-perspectives-on-critical-cyber-threats-law-and-norms/) Commentary [SAV Q&A with Bidushi Dhungel: Nepal’s Political Revolution and Quest for a More Equitable Future](https://www.stimson.org/2025/sav-qa-with-bidushi-dhungel-nepal/) Commentary [Implications of the SCO Summit Week in China](https://www.stimson.org/2025/implications-of-the-sco-summit-week-in-china/) Daniel Markey • Asfandyar Mir • Peter Slezkine... ## About Stimson ## Transparency ## People ## Contact General - 202.223.5956 - 1211 Connecticut Ave NW, 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 - Fax: 202.238.9604 Media Inquiries - 202.478.3437 - [Caiti Goodman](https://www.stimson.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3b585c54545f565a557b484f52564854551554495c) - [Communications Dept.](https://www.stimson.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9bf8f4f6f6eef5f2f8faeff2f4f5e8dbe8eff2f6e8f4f5b5f4e9fc) - [News & Announcements](https://www.stimson.org/about/stimson/media-announcements/) Copyright The Henry L.

In April, a widespread [power outage in Spain](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) showed how quickly a nation’s energy infrastructure can be stressed. If a similar outage were to occur in the UK and stretch beyond 24 hours, the effects would escalate from inconvenience to systemic risk for financial services: payment flows could seize up, trading could be disrupted, and millions could lose access to banking services. For a sector built on real-time settlement and continuous connectivity, this is a severe but plausible scenario that deserves active monitoring. These vulnerabilities are amplified by mounting pressures on the UK’s power system. Electricity demand is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centres, the electrification of transport and heating. Much of the grid infrastructure is aging, with uneven investment in upgrades. Winter peaks are increasingly shaped by extreme weather, and longer spells of low wind or sun can tighten operating margins just as demand surges. Findings Against this backdrop, the Swift Centre Forecasters were asked: **_Will the UK experience an electricity blackout lasting over 24 hours before December 31st 2026 that severely disrupts financial services?_** ## **Findings** On average, the Swift Centre forecasters put the probability of the UK experiencing a blackout lasting more than 24 hours before the end of 2026 at 7.8%. This means roughly a one-in-twelve chance of a systemic disruption to the UK’s financial services within the next two years. And this figure only covers the most severe case – outages lasting more than 24 hours. Shorter blackouts, which can still disrupt payments and trading, are supposedly more plausible. Behind this headline number, views diverged. A group clustered at the higher end, around 17-18%, emphasising severe weather and infrastructure fragility. Others leaned much lower (0.5-5%), pointing to the historical rarity of such long outages and the grid’s proven resilience. The gap reflects different judgments about what could plausibly drive a multi-day blackout, as well as competing views on the UK’s ability to withstand shocks. Those on the lower end argued that blackouts lasting more than 24 hours are historically rare in the UK and that the grid has generally proven resilient. One noted: “ _We have events that can be considered ‘major’ UK blackouts… However, few if any lasted longer than 12 hours_.” Another gave a 2% estimate but said this would rise to 5-10% if shorter outages were considered. In their view, the most plausible drivers of a multi-day blackout would be supply shortages rather than extreme weather. While storms and floods regularly cause localised outages, these are usually resolved in under 24 hours. By contrast, past rolling blackouts were linked to fuel constraints, and the UK’s relatively small gas storage capacity still represents a vulnerability: > “ _We currently store 12 days’ worth of winter gas demand, compared with 89 days in Germany and 103 days in France._” Even so, they judged that interconnectors to Europe and imports from the U.S. and Middle East make outright shortages unlikely in the forecast period. Cyberattacks were also downplayed as a plausible trigger. The grid remains relatively isolated from the internet, and past incidents (such as the [2019 lightning strike](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d96100340f0b61743bd4cc3/20191003_E3C_Interim_Report_into_GB_Power_Disruption.pdf)) have been rapidly contained: > “A _long, nationwide blackout won’t occur, in spite of the Grid’s finer supply and response time margins._” Others in the low-probability camp nudged their estimates slightly higher (up to 5%), emphasising recent close calls and the challenges of managing a system with more variable renewables. One observed that “ _risk is higher than in the past with increased share of volatile renewables._” Another pointed to the [near-blackout in January 2025](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/09/britain-came-within-whisker-blackouts-national-grid/): “ _Such close calls do make one wonder if the system is sufficiently resilient. But at the same time, that the situation at worst would have resulted in planned blackouts of about three hours._” By contrast, those at the higher end placed more weight on weather and infrastructure fragility. One reasoned that “ _blackouts in the UK are not particularly frequent and almost all of them \\[…\\] are related to severe weather,_” and identified 3-6 instances in the past three decades where outages lasted over 24 hours, leading them to a double digit estimate. Another highlighted specific cases – the [2013 Christmas storms](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c5576e5274a1b0042311a/DECC_-_Festive_disruption_review_-_Final__2_.pdf), [2015 floods](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-35020049), and storms [Arwen (2021)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storm-arwen-electricity-distribution-disruption-review) and [Eunice (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Eunice#:~:text=The%20UK%20was%20particularly%20hard,km%2Fh)%20were%20recorded.) – and concluded that “ _large towns going out for more than 24 hours is quite common._” A third, giving a 17% probability, focused on infrastructure risk, pointing to [Heathrow’s 18-hour outage in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-into-the-north-hyde-substation-outage-terms-of-reference) as a sign of weak redundancy: > “ _The recent shutdown of Heathrow due to a substation fire showed a weakness in ability to quickly shift to alternative sources._” They also added a small premium for cyberattacks, accounting for around 1.5% of their estimate. ## **If Winter Bites Harder** Forecasters were also asked to assess how their probabilities would change in the event of a severe winter in 2025 or 2026. In this scenario, severe winter was defined as record-low temperatures, low renewable generation, tight gas supplies, or extreme storms. Across the board, forecasters agreed that harsh winter conditions would make a long blackout more likely. Most described the effect as roughly doubling their baseline estimate, though the results varied widely depending on where they had started from. Justifications also differed: some emphasised the compounded stress on gas and renewables, others the physical damage caused by storms, and a few highlighted the risk of global energy supply constraints. For some, the increase was modest in absolute terms. One forecaster, for example, raised their probability from 2% to 4%, explaining: > “ _Even given a severe winter, I think the probability is very low as long as parts of the large town or region have power restored in under 24 hours, so I'm increasing my estimate by only two percentage points._” Another echoed this view, stressing that “ _Individual weather events like blizzards can cause blackouts without mounting to an extreme winter, so I go with a moderate increase._” Others arrived at higher final estimates. One calculated that roughly “ _47% of years with a major outage… would have resolved positively_” under the severe winter condition, leading them to double their baseline estimate to 40%. Another, who considered the combined risks of high winds, low temperature, major snow or ice storm, argued that resilience would be lower in such circumstances: > “ _Even the loss of a couple of power stations would be a major concern to the UK’s power grid._” They concluded that the probability would be about double their baseline, at 9.8%. Several forecasters pointed to infrastructure fragility and gas reliance as the key vulnerabilities exposed by severe winter conditions. One noted: > “ _The UK increasingly relies on natural gas and renewables. Given such reliance, a period of extreme cold along with low winds could \\[cause\\] selective power outages_.” Another cited National Energy System Operator projections showing “ _the strongest electricity operational margins for the UK grid since 2019,_” but still allowed for the possibility that an unusually cold winter could coincide with global demand pressures and LNG import shortages, settling on a 20% estimate. A final forecaster placed their probability at 25%, reasoning that while severe weather is rare in the UK, it can be very difficult to repair quickly when it does occur: > “ _Ice storms are very rare in the UK, but if they occur, can be devastating to power lines and time-consuming to repair. … I expect that loss of power to a medium-sized city for 24 hours is a relatively low bar and would be difficult to solve without repairs of numerous transmission lines._” ## **Knock-On Effects on Banking Services** Forecasters were also asked to estimate the likelihood that such a blackout would prevent at least 100,000 people in the UK from accessing their bank accounts before 2027. All forecasters judged this outcome to be plausible, with estimates ranging from 30% to 75% and averaging 58%. That implies better than even odds that a major blackout would leave more than 100,000 people unable to access their bank accounts. While confidence levels varied, the consensus was clear: a prolonged outage would almost certainly disrupt financial services on a large scale. At the top end, one forecaster assigned a 75% probability, arguing that the scale of disruption in a 24-hour+ blackout would inevitably capture this many people. Others supported this view with slightly lower estimates. One (62%) explained: > “ _If it lasts for more than 24 hours, it’s likely a nationwide blackout… This very likely means that more than 100,000 people would be unable to access their bank accounts or make payments for at least 12 hours._” Another (63%) stressed that “ _branches and ATMs would naturally be down… The last break point could be the one that matters the most, since an increasing number of people rely on the internet to bank._” Several other forecasters converging around the 50-60% range, emphasised that mundane banking services would fail under these conditions. One wrote: > “ _Should a blackout happen, just about everyone affected by a blackout will lose online access to bank accounts. The main banks may function OK for some time but \\[the\\] majority of the cashpoints will be down. And of course 99% of stores of all kinds will not be able to receive card payments._” Another added that “ _even for those with access to banking by phone app and laptop, cell tower operation, internet service, and the ability to recharge devices are likely to put the number over 100,000._” The only forecaster at the lower end (30%) argued that the internet is not always disabled during power outages, and that people might continue using phones and other battery-operated devices, limiting the number directly affected. Despite these differences, the consensus was clear: once a 24-hours blackout occurs, cascading failures across ATMs, payment systems, telecommunications, and local infrastructure make it highly likely that at least 100,000 people will lose access to their bank accounts. ## **Conclusion** Forecasters judged a multi-day UK blackout to be relatively unlikely – in the single digits under normal conditions – yet the aggregated estimate of 7.8% (with highs of 18%) is still concerning. For a risk that could paralyse payments, trading, and customer access to banking services, even single-digit probabilities amount to a material threat. The risk also rises further under severe winter conditions, with several forecasters effectively doubling their baseline estimates in that scenario. And the consensus was clear: if such a blackout were to occur, the impact on the financial system would be severe.

In April, a widespread [power outage in Spain](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) showed how quickly a nation’s energy infrastructure can be stressed. If a similar outage were to occur in the UK and stretch beyond 24 hours, the effects would escalate from inconvenience to systemic risk for financial services: payment flows could seize up, trading could be disrupted, and millions could lose access to banking services. For a sector built on real-time settlement and continuous connectivity, this is a severe but plausible scenario that deserves active monitoring. These vulnerabilities are amplified by mounting pressures on the UK’s power system. Electricity demand is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centres, the electrification of transport and heating. Much of the grid infrastructure is aging, with uneven investment in upgrades. Winter peaks are increasingly shaped by extreme weather, and longer spells of low wind or sun can tighten operating margins just as demand surges. Findings Against this backdrop, the Swift Centre Forecasters were asked: **_Will the UK experience an electricity blackout lasting over 24 hours before December 31st 2026 that severely disrupts financial services?_** ## **Findings** On average, the Swift Centre forecasters put the probability of the UK experiencing a blackout lasting more than 24 hours before the end of 2026 at 7.8%. This means roughly a one-in-twelve chance of a systemic disruption to the UK’s financial services within the next two years. And this figure only covers the most severe case – outages lasting more than 24 hours. Shorter blackouts, which can still disrupt payments and trading, are supposedly more plausible. Behind this headline number, views diverged. A group clustered at the higher end, around 17-18%, emphasising severe weather and infrastructure fragility. Others leaned much lower (0.5-5%), pointing to the historical rarity of such long outages and the grid’s proven resilience. The gap reflects different judgments about what could plausibly drive a multi-day blackout, as well as competing views on the UK’s ability to withstand shocks. Those on the lower end argued that blackouts lasting more than 24 hours are historically rare in the UK and that the grid has generally proven resilient. One noted: “ _We have events that can be considered ‘major’ UK blackouts… However, few if any lasted longer than 12 hours_.” Another gave a 2% estimate but said this would rise to 5-10% if shorter outages were considered. In their view, the most plausible drivers of a multi-day blackout would be supply shortages rather than extreme weather. While storms and floods regularly cause localised outages, these are usually resolved in under 24 hours. By contrast, past rolling blackouts were linked to fuel constraints, and the UK’s relatively small gas storage capacity still represents a vulnerability: > “ _We currently store 12 days’ worth of winter gas demand, compared with 89 days in Germany and 103 days in France._” Even so, they judged that interconnectors to Europe and imports from the U.S. and Middle East make outright shortages unlikely in the forecast period. Cyberattacks were also downplayed as a plausible trigger. The grid remains relatively isolated from the internet, and past incidents (such as the [2019 lightning strike](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d96100340f0b61743bd4cc3/20191003_E3C_Interim_Report_into_GB_Power_Disruption.pdf)) have been rapidly contained: > “A _long, nationwide blackout won’t occur, in spite of the Grid’s finer supply and response time margins._” Others in the low-probability camp nudged their estimates slightly higher (up to 5%), emphasising recent close calls and the challenges of managing a system with more variable renewables. One observed that “ _risk is higher than in the past with increased share of volatile renewables._” Another pointed to the [near-blackout in January 2025](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/09/britain-came-within-whisker-blackouts-national-grid/): “ _Such close calls do make one wonder if the system is sufficiently resilient. But at the same time, that the situation at worst would have resulted in planned blackouts of about three hours._” By contrast, those at the higher end placed more weight on weather and infrastructure fragility. One reasoned that “ _blackouts in the UK are not particularly frequent and almost all of them \\[…\\] are related to severe weather,_” and identified 3-6 instances in the past three decades where outages lasted over 24 hours, leading them to a double digit estimate. Another highlighted specific cases – the [2013 Christmas storms](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c5576e5274a1b0042311a/DECC_-_Festive_disruption_review_-_Final__2_.pdf), [2015 floods](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-35020049), and storms [Arwen (2021)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storm-arwen-electricity-distribution-disruption-review) and [Eunice (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Eunice#:~:text=The%20UK%20was%20particularly%20hard,km%2Fh)%20were%20recorded.) – and concluded that “ _large towns going out for more than 24 hours is quite common._” A third, giving a 17% probability, focused on infrastructure risk, pointing to [Heathrow’s 18-hour outage in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-into-the-north-hyde-substation-outage-terms-of-reference) as a sign of weak redundancy: > “ _The recent shutdown of Heathrow due to a substation fire showed a weakness in ability to quickly shift to alternative sources._” They also added a small premium for cyberattacks, accounting for around 1.5% of their estimate. ## **If Winter Bites Harder** Forecasters were also asked to assess how their probabilities would change in the event of a severe winter in 2025 or 2026. In this scenario, severe winter was defined as record-low temperatures, low renewable generation, tight gas supplies, or extreme storms. Across the board, forecasters agreed that harsh winter conditions would make a long blackout more likely. Most described the effect as roughly doubling their baseline estimate, though the results varied widely depending on where they had started from. Justifications also differed: some emphasised the compounded stress on gas and renewables, others the physical damage caused by storms, and a few highlighted the risk of global energy supply constraints. For some, the increase was modest in absolute terms. One forecaster, for example, raised their probability from 2% to 4%, explaining: > “ _Even given a severe winter, I think the probability is very low as long as parts of the large town or region have power restored in under 24 hours, so I'm increasing my estimate by only two percentage points._” Another echoed this view, stressing that “ _Individual weather events like blizzards can cause blackouts without mounting to an extreme winter, so I go with a moderate increase._” Others arrived at higher final estimates. One calculated that roughly “ _47% of years with a major outage… would have resolved positively_” under the severe winter condition, leading them to double their baseline estimate to 40%. Another, who considered the combined risks of high winds, low temperature, major snow or ice storm, argued that resilience would be lower in such circumstances: > “ _Even the loss of a couple of power stations would be a major concern to the UK’s power grid._” They concluded that the probability would be about double their baseline, at 9.8%. Several forecasters pointed to infrastructure fragility and gas reliance as the key vulnerabilities exposed by severe winter conditions. One noted: > “ _The UK increasingly relies on natural gas and renewables. Given such reliance, a period of extreme cold along with low winds could \\[cause\\] selective power outages_.” Another cited National Energy System Operator projections showing “ _the strongest electricity operational margins for the UK grid since 2019,_” but still allowed for the possibility that an unusually cold winter could coincide with global demand pressures and LNG import shortages, settling on a 20% estimate. A final forecaster placed their probability at 25%, reasoning that while severe weather is rare in the UK, it can be very difficult to repair quickly when it does occur: > “ _Ice storms are very rare in the UK, but if they occur, can be devastating to power lines and time-consuming to repair. … I expect that loss of power to a medium-sized city for 24 hours is a relatively low bar and would be difficult to solve without repairs of numerous transmission lines._” ## **Knock-On Effects on Banking Services** Forecasters were also asked to estimate the likelihood that such a blackout would prevent at least 100,000 people in the UK from accessing their bank accounts before 2027. All forecasters judged this outcome to be plausible, with estimates ranging from 30% to 75% and averaging 58%. That implies better than even odds that a major blackout would leave more than 100,000 people unable to access their bank accounts. While confidence levels varied, the consensus was clear: a prolonged outage would almost certainly disrupt financial services on a large scale. At the top end, one forecaster assigned a 75% probability, arguing that the scale of disruption in a 24-hour+ blackout would inevitably capture this many people. Others supported this view with slightly lower estimates. One (62%) explained: > “ _If it lasts for more than 24 hours, it’s likely a nationwide blackout… This very likely means that more than 100,000 people would be unable to access their bank accounts or make payments for at least 12 hours._” Another (63%) stressed that “ _branches and ATMs would naturally be down… The last break point could be the one that matters the most, since an increasing number of people rely on the internet to bank._” Several other forecasters converging around the 50-60% range, emphasised that mundane banking services would fail under these conditions. One wrote: > “ _Should a blackout happen, just about everyone affected by a blackout will lose online access to bank accounts. The main banks may function OK for some time but \\[the\\] majority of the cashpoints will be down. And of course 99% of stores of all kinds will not be able to receive card payments._” Another added that “ _even for those with access to banking by phone app and laptop, cell tower operation, internet service, and the ability to recharge devices are likely to put the number over 100,000._” The only forecaster at the lower end (30%) argued that the internet is not always disabled during power outages, and that people might continue using phones and other battery-operated devices, limiting the number directly affected. Despite these differences, the consensus was clear: once a 24-hours blackout occurs, cascading failures across ATMs, payment systems, telecommunications, and local infrastructure make it highly likely that at least 100,000 people will lose access to their bank accounts. ## **Conclusion** Forecasters judged a multi-day UK blackout to be relatively unlikely – in the single digits under normal conditions – yet the aggregated estimate of 7.8% (with highs of 18%) is still concerning. For a risk that could paralyse payments, trading, and customer access to banking services, even single-digit probabilities amount to a material threat. The risk also rises further under severe winter conditions, with several forecasters effectively doubling their baseline estimates in that scenario. And the consensus was clear: if such a blackout were to occur, the impact on the financial system would be severe.

America’s power grid is straining under the weight of a fast-changing energy landscape. Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore. This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough. ## **A Demand Surge Few Anticipated** For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected. Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about [4.4% of U.S. electricity](https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it), and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment. Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”— [now handles 70% of global internet traffic](https://oxfordamerican.org/oa-now/how-data-center-alley-is-changing-northern-virginia), pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need [500,000 more electricians](https://www.ciphernews.com/hot-take/500000-electricians/) in the next decade. Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth [equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities](https://www.nwcouncil.org/fs/18720/2024_05_3.pdf) within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from [4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/elec_coal_renew.php), with similar gains to follow. And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records. ## **The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement** Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power. [The EIA projects](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64604) 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace. Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 [Resource Adequacy Report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/DOE%20Final%20EO%20Report%20%28FINAL%20JULY%207%29_0.pdf) warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem. Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others [told Congress bluntly](https://www.powermag.com/nations-power-operators-warn-congress-of-a-coming-reliability-shortfall/) in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.” ## **Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage** Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks. Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions. As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, [DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/department-energy-awards-42-million-guard-power-grid-cyber-threats), including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy. Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. [Homeland Security now classifies grid protection](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors) alongside nuclear and water infrastructure. ## **Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays** Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish. Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress. As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. [faced delays](https://www.wapa.gov/supply-chains/) of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion. Even bipartisan efforts like the [CIRCUIT Act](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/circuit-act)—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns. Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow. ## **What’s Being Done** Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes. DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles. In 2025, [DOE launched $32 million](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/15/us-doe-invests-32-million-for-grid-edge-technology-and-smart-charge-management/) in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in. ## **Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium** For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states. Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment. Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management. With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” [Deloitte estimates](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/funding-growth-in-us-power-sector.html) the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit. ## **Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?** The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system. Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility.

After all, it marked the rise of a Hindu woman, celebrated for her work against corruption. However, such an interpretation is extremely superficial and overlooks a crucial factor in serious geopolitical analysis: geography – both physical and human. Nepal is an overwhelmingly Hindu nation, with Muslims making up around 5% of the population. In such a country, any radical uprising or coup is unlikely to come from religious minorities. On the contrary, the only plausible path to radicalization would be through Hindutva nationalism – the extremist political wing of Hinduism, also present in India but institutionally restrained by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While Modi is often portrayed in the West as a “Hindu radical,” the reality is far more complex. He does rely on Hindutva sentiment for political support, but he governs with caution and moderation. Modi skillfully manages internal pressures and avoids opening external conflict fronts that could destabilize India – as demonstrated by his restrained stance in response to the massacre of Hindus in Bangladesh and the recent war with Pakistan. Nepal’s instability, however, adds another dangerous piece to the problem in India’s immediate neighborhood. First came the ousting of Imran Khan’s moderate government in Pakistan, paving the way for chaos and war. Then, a coup in Bangladesh opened the door to Wahhabi extremism and led to the persecution of Hindus. Now, Nepal becomes a new geopolitical pawn, with the rise of a radicalized force disguised as democratic change. The notion that this scenario benefits India by strengthening Hinduism is short-sighted. In fact, India is being encircled. Nepal’s radicalization not only escalates religious tensions within India – which also has a vast Muslim population – but also opens a new anti-China front in the Himalayan region. Nepalese Hindu nationalists are, in most cases, openly anti-Beijing and could be used as a tool to sabotage Chinese stability in Tibet and western provinces. This is where the key point arises: India and China are rivals, but not existential enemies. Both understand that as long as NATO exists, they need one another. India’s participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) illustrates that both Asian giants grasp the gravity of the threat posed by the Collective West. A weakened India would expose China’s vulnerable southwestern flank – especially if India were to fragment into pro-Western microstates. Likewise, an unstable China would collapse Eurasian containment strategies and inevitably trigger a crisis along Russia’s eastern borders. In short, what is happening in Nepal is not just a local political rearrangement. It is another strategic move in the encirclement of India and China – a direct attempt to destabilize South Asia and, indirectly, the very heart of Eurasia to prevent the consolidation of a multipolar world order. It’s no coincidence that this crisis erupted amid heightened diplomatic tensions between India and the U.S., and even more tellingly, after Modi engaged in deep cooperation initiatives with both China and Russia. As long as NATO remains the world’s dominant imperialist military alliance, the great Eurasian civilizations must join forces, setting aside historical and regional rivalries. The alternative is a cascading collapse. The so-called “democratic coup” in Nepal is a warning: the West understands the stakes – and it’s playing hard to block the rise of a multi-civilizational Eurasian alliance.

Wikimedia Commons A map of the India- China border in Ladakh, depicting the 1956 and 1960 claim lines of China, as well as lines of actual control before and after the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Wikimedia Commons [Sushant Singh](https://caravanmagazine.in/author/sushant-singh) 30 September, 2022 **FOR THE FIRST TIME** in forty-five years, on 15 June 2020, India and China recorded the death of Indian soldiers on the Line of Actual Control—the contested border between the two countries, which stretches from the Karakoram Pass in the west to Myanmar in the east. The deaths occurred in the Galwan Valley, in Ladakh, and these were the first military casualties in the territory since the 1962 Sino-India War. The full details of the incident are shrouded in ambiguity, but it involved Chinese soldiers pitching tents around the Galwan Valley and their forceful eviction by the Indian Army—there is little clarity on whether China’s People’s Liberation Army had agreed to abandon these positions. This led to a clash which claimed the lives of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four PLA soldiers. More than seventy Indian soldiers were injured while nearly a hundred more, including some officers, were taken captive by the Chinese. No Chinese soldier was in Indian captivity. “We were taken by surprise by how well prepared they were for the clash,” a top officer at the army headquarters in Delhi, who was part of the decision-making in the Ladakh crisis, told me. The LAC has neither been delineated on the map nor demarcated on the ground by either side. The last attempt to do so failed nearly two decades ago. The difference in the two sides’ understanding of it is so vast that New Delhi claims the border between the two countries is 3,488 kilometres long while China says it is only around two thousand. It is the world’s longest disputed border. As the two countries do not agree on where the “actual control” exercised by either side ends, both are engaged in an uncompromising contest of asserting control over small parcels of land in a desolate Himalayan wasteland. The demonstration of territorial claims can take several forms, including soldiers patrolling up to certain points, building infrastructure along the border and controlling the limits to which people in border villages are allowed to graze their animals. The unforgiving terrain and harsh weather have not dissuaded India and China from deploying around fifty thousand additional soldiers each on the 832-kilometre LAC in Ladakh since the summer of 2020. The deadly Galwan clash occurred at patrolling point PP14—an area that was not until then disputed, and which the Indian Army patrolled regularly. Days after it, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared in Delhi that the Chinese had not “intruded into our border, nor has any post been taken over by them”—an attempt at saving face that China gleefully seized upon as proof that it had not encroached upon Indian territory. The clamour around the deaths and the release of captive Indian soldiers, however, had blown the lid off the government’s attempts to play down the crisis in Ladakh. The situation had already come to public notice in India a month earlier because of massive physical clashes on the north bank of Pangong Lake, also in Ladakh. There were severe injuries on both sides, but no deaths. These major episodes marked the border crisis of the summer of 2020, even though tension had been building for months before that. Two and a half years later, the state of ties between the two neighbours can be aptly described as “No War, No Peace.” This was an expression used by military officers more than two decades ago to describe the situation on the border in the restive Kashmir region between India and Pakistan—the Line of Control. The two situations are materially different, but the terminology makes a connection that was pointed out to me by a senior Indian military commander who was involved in handling the Ladakh crisis. When I asked him about the thinking that impelled military actions leading into the crisis in the summer of 2020, he said, “Do not treat China on the LAC like Pakistan on the LoC.”",

With the new set of US tariffs on India, the total has now climbed to 50 per cent. In its first response, India has called the additional tariffs “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,” expressing deep disappointment over what it described as a “misguided and discriminatory” action. Meanwhile, PM Modi too responded to the US tariffs on India, saying India will “never compromise” on the interests of its farmers and dairy sector, and declared he was prepared to bear a significant personal cost if necessary.

GTRI, in its analysis, has categorised India's export segments in three categories- very high impact sectors (exports may be down by 50-70 per cent), high-impact sectors (exports may be down by 30-50 per cent), and low or no impact areas. 7 Aug 2025, 07:52:07 PM IST ## Trump Tariffs India LIVE: US will not dominate like India in long term, says Gujarat businessman “The affected sectors are the textile and chemical sectors, which we excel at exporting to the US... Regarding the spices sector, in the short term, we are losing some business from the US, but in the long term, they have to purchase spices from India... We also consider the diamond and jewellery market in the US. India is the largest exporter of diamonds and jewellery. So it affects the market. However, in the long term, I believe the US will not dominate like India.

The trade deal has been struck over the US demand for greater access to India's agricultural and dairy market. It wants reduced tariffs on products like corn, soybeans, apples, almonds and ethanol, as well as increased access for US dairy products. New Delhi is, however, resisting these demands as these will have a direct bearing on farmers. But before a US-India deal could be reached, Trump launched a scathing attack on India over New Delhi's business dealings with Russia – Russia launched a war on Ukraine over three years ago. Frustrated over not being able to end the war – as Trump portrays himself as a peacemaker – Trump has started targeting the countries that have business deals with Moscow. As more details have started to emerge and anticipating more ‘sanctions’ on countries over their businesses with Russia, LiveMint is running a LIVE blog.

Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

This year, a leading engineering society [graded](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2025/05/the-urgent-need-for-energy-infrastructure-improvements) the country’s energy system a D+; 70 percent of transmission lines are more than 25 years old, 55 percent of transformers are near end of life, and the average lead time for new transformers is over a year. On top of all that, hotter and more frequent heat waves are degrading the grid. Despite these deficiencies, new demands are being made of the system, from massive new “hyperscale” data centers and more electric vehicle charging stations to the onshoring of manufacturing. Additionally, as temperatures rise and cyberattacks boosted by artificial intelligence (AI) become more potent, the United States needs to invest in a more resilient grid—or risk an energy insecure future. #### Past and future risks to grid reliability Threats to electricity systems include many new and evolving digital and physical risks to companies, cities, and individuals, including disruptions to technological and communications services. On the physical side, floods, fires, and extreme heat events, which are [increasingly posing physical threats](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/weather-related-power-outages-rising) to energy infrastructure. Digital threats come in the form of ransomware and other cyberattacks, and sometimes arise simply out of the enormous complexity of today’s systems. For example, the [2024 CrowdStrike disruption](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/delta-crowdstrike-global-it-outage-explained)—which was caused by a faulty software update that crashed Windows systems worldwide—affected US Department of Energysystems as well as those at a number of [electric utilities](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/outage-management/widespread-technology-outage-disrupts-flights-banks-media-outlets-and-companies-around-the-world/), and stranded or otherwise impacted 1.3 million airline passengers. When these events occur, disruptions to commerce and society follow and highlight the obligations that infrastructure planners and defenders have to limit harm from such incidents—obligations that simply cannot be deferred. And yet, upgrades to some of the most important parts of US critical infrastructure arebeing deferred. Today, on average, large US grid transformers, which are essential to electricity reliability, are [past their designed lifespan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/EXEC-2022-001242%20-%20Large%20Power%20Transformer%20Resilience%20Report%20signed%20by%20Secretary%20Granholm%20on%207-10-24.pdf), and the backlog for replacements is [often three years or more](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/reshore-electrical-equipment-backlogs-transformer-breaker-nema/749265/). Grid operators—and all who depend on the grid—are forced to rely on this old equipment. Meanwhile, [rising temperatures are aging grid components faster](https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/climate-and-natural-catastrophe-risk/impact-of-climate-on-electric-grids.html#:~:text=Global%20warming%20projections%20of%202,(%3E%204%C2%B0C)) by increasing chemical and mechanical stress on them, which leads to reduced efficiency, faster degradation, and increased failure rates. In addition to these long-standing challenges, three major trends have recently emerged that place additional pressure on the electric system: electricity-hungry, AI-powering data centers; the increasing number of electric vehicles and charging stations; and the electrification of everything, perhaps best represented by [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces) replacing oil and gas-burning furnaces. At the same time, the nation is confronted with operational risks and constraints that US grid managers are struggling mightily to manage, such as how to handle increasing shares of non-dispatchable renewable generation as well as rapid policy changes like executive orders to keep coal plants running and restart shuttered nuclear plants. #### Disruption drives agile solutions There is a way forward, inspired by past grid failures and wartime emergencies. When challenged with disruptions, grid operators have not only responded with agility but also applied lessons learned to greatly reduce the potential for future cascades. The Northeastern blackout of 2003, for example, provided a major wake-up call. It affected [50 million people and cost about $6 billion](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2003-blackout-five-years-later/). While numerous improvements followed, three in particular did much to improve the [US grid’s resilience posture](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/blackout-2003-blackout-final-implementation-report) via enhanced communications: the installation by the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Committee (NERC) of a new conference bridge to greatly enhance communications during crises; the creation of a new set of procedures and protocols for reliability coordinator hotline calls; and enhancements to the decentralized system data exchange network with automated hourly uploads of outage data. Another example—a far more devastating one—is Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in Ukraine. Under heavy attacks aimed at knocking out civilian infrastructure, Ukrainians, in a show of unity, deployed backup generators and battery packs in unprecedented numbers, adhered to strict schedules for electricity usage set by the utilities, and—as much as possible—decentralized power generation. Although the United States is not at war, the impacts of climate change and cyberattacks could have similar effects on infrastructure and require similar solutions. To address the growing demand for electricity, the United States must generate and deliver much greater quantities of electricity reliably, safely, and securely, all while limiting emissions. Enhanced demand management, as practiced with precision in Ukraine, is one tool that may help. #### Anticipating future challenges The truth is that the US electric system is not operating the way it was designed. That’s because its developers did not anticipate the arrival of such dynamism. Meeting new challenges will require leadership and collective will, and for society to make itself more resilient by preparing in advance for more and longer-duration outages with backup generators and microgrids. To meet the challenges of a future where energy demand keeps rising, warming temperatures place new pressures on critical infrastructure, and cyber criminals threaten to cause massive disruption, the United States must leverage its collective imagination to rally its businesses and citizens to prepare for a less reliable grid. This is accomplished, in part, by full-scale exercises like NERC’s biennial [GridEx](https://www.nerc.com/pa/CI/ESISAC/Pages/GridEx.aspx) series, as well as through regional resilience summits. The property of resilience isn’t required until there is scarcity, a stressor, or other forms of adversity. It comes into play when an entity doesn’t have all that it needs or is under assault, but, by prior preparation, is not defeated. _[Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) is the senior grid strategist for Idaho National Laboratory’s National and Homeland Security directorate._ ## About the author Former fellow ### [Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Former Nonresident Senior Fellow](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Global Energy Center](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/our-programs/global-energy-center/) [Cybersecurity](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/cybersecurity/) [Energy & Environment](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/energy-environment/) ## Stay Connected #### Sign up for PowerPlay, the Atlantic Council’s bimonthly newsletter keeping you up to date on all facets of the energy transition ## related content [EnergySourceAug 28, 2025\\ \\ **Overheated and underbuilt: How to fortify the US grid in the face of heat waves** \\ \\ ByFrank Willey\\ \\ As demand for electricity rises across the United States—and in the Mid-Atlantic in particular—to cool homes and power data center growth, so does its cost.

To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade.

Cyclone Hudhud, earthquake in China, monsoon floods in India and Pakistan led to loss of over 7000 lives in Asia in 2014, with a total cost of disaster events estimated at USD 52 billion. Globally, total economic losses from all disaster events were USD 110 billion in 2014, where Asia contributed 47% to the total global losses. Out of the total loss, only USD 5.2 billion worth of losses were insured in Asia. There still lies a big protection gap with the lack of insurance cover in many countries in Asia. Economic development, population growth, a high concentration of assets in exposed areas and a changing climate are increasing the economic cost of natural disasters. These, if not accompanied by a commensurate increase in insurance penetration, will likely result in a widening protection gap over the long term. [Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6cbsSDuMRmPCIgXS2t) Heavy monsoon in northern India and Pakistan In early September, monsoon rains in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir in India and the neighbouring region in Pakistan resulted in the worst flooding in 60 years. At least 665 perished and over 200 000 houses were destroyed. However, the rural communities were hit harder as the floods came at harvest time for rice and apple crops, the livelihood of many farmers. Together, the total losses in India and Pakistan were USD 5.9 billion, and insured losses were at least USD 0.2 billion.The total losses from the destruction of housing in India were at USD 4.4 billion. Cyclone Hudhud caused the largest loss from a tropical cyclone The biggest storm of the Pacific and Indian Ocean season was Cyclone Hudhud in October. Hudhud made landfall near the port city of Visakhapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh with winds of up to 200 km/124 miles per hour and a storm surge of up to three metres in some areas. The storm brought heavy rains and flooding in neighbouring states also. With a population of 2 million, Visakhapatnam is the third largest city on India's east coast. The total losses were estimated at USD 7 billion, the largest of all natural catastrophes in the world in 2014. However, the insured losses were a fraction of the total at just USD 0.6 billion. The cyclone claimed 68 lives but the number could have been much higher. Early warning and evacuation of up to 400 000 people ahead of the storm saved many lives. ### Also Read [**Asia Pack reports standalone net loss of Rs 0.12 crore in the December 2014 quarter**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-reports-standalone-net-loss-of-rs-0-12-crore-in-the-december-2014-quarter-115021001278_1.html) [**Asia Pack reports standalone net loss of Rs 0.09 crore in the September 2014 quarter**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-reports-standalone-net-loss-of-rs-0-09-crore-in-the-september-2014-quarter-114111300121_1.html) [**Reuters poll - Asia easing views hurt FX sentiment**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/reuters/reuters-poll-asia-easing-views-hurt-fx-sentiment-115020500537_1.html) [**Asia Pack to hold board meeting**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-to-hold-board-meeting-114110600357_1.html) [**Asia Pack to hold board meeting**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/asia-pack-to-hold-board-meeting-115013100492_1.html) [**US to offer smart transport solutions for Allahabad, Ajmer and Visakhapatnam**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/us-to-offer-smart-transport-solutions-for-allahabad-ajmer-and-visakhapatnam-115040900957_1.html) [**Indian Railways' Freight Loading Up By 4.18 Per Cent During Fiscal 2014-15**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/indian-railways-freight-loading-up-by-4-18-per-cent-during-fiscal-2014-15-115040900956_1.html) [**Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy Launches Human Resource and Skill Requirement Reports for 24 Priority Sectors**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/shri-rajiv-pratap-rudy-launches-human-resource-and-skill-requirement-reports-for-24-priority-sectors-115040900771_1.html) [**Ind-Ra: Decline in Gas Prices to Drive a Marginal Reduction In Urea Subsidy**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/ind-ra-decline-in-gas-prices-to-drive-a-marginal-reduction-in-urea-subsidy-115040900769_1.html) [**Union Tourism Minister Dr Mahesh Sharma launches the 'Visit Kerala 2015' Initiative of Kerala Tourism**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/union-tourism-minister-dr-mahesh-sharma-launches-the-visit-kerala-2015-initiative-of-kerala-tourism-115040900768_1.html) Bulk of convective storm activity in India and Bangladesh In Asia, the bulk of the severe convective storm activity occurs in India and Bangladesh, most often in the pre-monsoon period from March-May. The storms are classified by wind speed, with speeds of 42 meters per second/151 km per hour or higher referred to as tornadoes, and below that as nor'westers. The four deadliest tornadoes on sigma records were all in Bangladesh and the fifth and sixth in India. Total economic losses were lower in 2014 Global insured losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters were USD 35 billion in 2014, down from USD 44 billion in 2013 and well below the USD 64 billion-average of the previous 10 years. Around 12,700 people lost their lives in all disaster events, down from as many as 27,000 in 2013, making it one of the lowest numbers ever recorded in a single year. The number of victims of disaster events in 2014 was one of the lowest recorded. Improvements in early warning systems and emergency preparedness meant fewer victims than otherwise may have been.

In a fiery post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that while India is a “friend”, it has imposed some of the “highest tariffs” on the United States and maintained “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers.

Donald Trump's 25% tariff announcement was met with strong criticism from Opposition leaders. Indian trade bodies have also voiced disappointment, with leaders in India’s gems and jewellery sector warning of short-term disruptions, job losses, and higher prices for US buyers, reported ANI.

So, there's a lot at stake here for both countries...The President is not signalling a lack of confidence or a lack of interest in this strategic partnership. He's simply deploying a negotiating tactic that he has used in the past with very close partners and allies...I hope that our Indian friends will keep that in mind as well as they work through these issues,\" says former US Assistant State Secretary, Nisha Biswal. 31 Jul 2025, 06:49:57 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Trump tariff on India can cut full year GDP rate by 20 bps, says expert “The 25% tariff rate is certainly a negative development as it compares to lower rate for peers such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines which compete with India in a similar category of labour-intensive products and electronic goods. The currency market had clearly priced this eventually as the USDINR pair moved by more than 70 paise today. The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by Sept-October, we see a downside to full year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 bps,” says Garima Kapoor, Economist and Executive Vice President, Elara Capital. 31 Jul 2025, 06:33:27 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: Trump says India willing to cut tariffs ‘substantially’ “We had a tremendous trade deficit.

They have one of the highest tariffs in the world. Now, they are willing to cut it very substantially. But we will see what happens. We are talking to India now. We will see what happens.

So it's partially BRICS and it's partially trade,” Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday. 31 Jul 2025, 12:23:39 AM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: 'This is India’s moment to scale up,' says PHDCCI Chief CEO and Secretary General of PHDCCI, Ranjeet Mehta, said: \"We are now entering an era of new alignments in the global supply chain. The US is also recalibrating its trade policy by imposing tariffs on major exporting economies like China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India. There will be a momentary impact on our MSMEs, but we see this as an opportunity, also. This is the time that India scales it up.

We will have many more options for exporting to other countries. It will hurt us as the US is a big market for the Gem and Jewelery industry. It will affect us, but it will not hamper us,\" Gupta told ANI. 30 Jul 2025, 11:52:10 PM IST ## Trump’s Tariffs on India LIVE: 'We’ve got options' - India industry leader hits back at US \"Given the current scenario, India has already found alternative routes.

    "full_text": "Search # Is India being forced closer to China and other BRICS nations by US tarrifs? / MOFA - People's Republic of China By bno Chennai OfficeAugust 22, 2025 India’s economic relationship with China has evolved in uneven but persistent ways since 2005, when both sides agreed that boundary disputes would not obstruct broader cooperation. That principle allowed trade to flourish despite recurring standoffs in Ladakh, Doklam, and Galwan. According to a new report by _Carnegie India_, [bilateral trade](https://www.intellinews.com/india-china-move-to-restart-border-trade-after-five-year-gap-396286/?source=india) grew from $17bn in 2005 to nearly $120bn by 2024, with China becoming India’s largest trading partner and the trade deficit swelling to almost $100bn. Attempts to narrow the gap by boosting Indian exports ran into Chinese non-tariff barriers in pharmaceuticals, IT, and procurement, leaving India structurally dependent on Chinese goods. Through these years, even the most violent clashes along the Line of Actual Control did not dent the trajectory of imports; only global shocks such as the 2008 financial crisis, the 2018 trade war, and the 2020 pandemic briefly slowed the deficit’s rise. Investment flows tell a more complex story. Chinese commitments in manufacturing and infrastructure spiked after 2014, riding Xi Jinping’s outbound investment liberalisation and Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” campaign. According to the _Carnegie India_ report, big-ticket deals, such as Fosun’s acquisition of Gland Pharma, signalled growing comfort with cross-border capital. But momentum was cut short by Beijing’s clampdown on outbound flows in 2016 and India’s abrupt policy pivot in 2020 after Galwan. The introduction of mandatory screening for investments from land-bordering countries effectively shut down new Chinese capital. Venture investment, which had funneled billions into India’s booming internet economy, was also caught in the crossfire. By 2019, nearly two-thirds of India’s unicorns counted Chinese investors, but the subsequent app bans and policy shifts triggered rapid unwinding. What was once a deepening digital partnership was dismantled within half a decade, leaving only a few residual stakes by 2025. Public procurement emerged as another battleground. A July 2020 order barred bidders from border-sharing countries without special clearance, effectively targeting Chinese construction and engineering firms. While this halted new government contracts, ongoing projects continued to generate billions in revenue for Chinese companies, and Indian contractors still relied heavily on Chinese input for railways and power equipment. This contradiction highlighted the limits of punitive procurement policies in a market where domestic substitutes remain underdeveloped. The broader calculus grew even more complicated in 2025 as India’s relationship with the US has hit turbulence during Donald Trump’s second term. Early in the year, both sides announced ambitious trade targets, but optimism soured quickly. Trump imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports under the banner of “reciprocity,” escalating the measures within weeks. He further linked a hike in tariff to penalties on India’s continued imports of discounted Russian oil, casting the issue as one of strategic loyalty. New Delhi dismissed the tariffs as unjustified and bristled at Washington’s attempts to dictate its energy policy. The trade war spilled into defense, with reports of procurement delays feeding speculation about a deeper chill in ties. The friction with Washington also carried political consequences at home. Modi’s government, once keen to frame India as a natural US partner in countering China, now faced a difficult balancing act. Public opinion turned skeptical of the reliability of American commitments, while business lobbies fretted over lost export markets. The sudden reversal in tone from Washington reinforced India’s instinct to hedge, looking beyond its Quad partnership to [options within BRICS](https://www.intellinews.com/the-unintended-consequence-of-trump-s-tariffs-is-pushing-brics-together-396138/?source=india) and other multilateral formats. For Beijing, the cracks in the US-India relationship presented an opening to soften its own posture and explore areas of cooperation despite the lingering shadow of Galwan. Taken together, these dynamics underscore the paradox at the heart of India’s economic statecraft. Trade with China remains indispensable but lopsided. Investment ties can be throttled or revived depending on political calculations. Procurement restrictions reveal dependency even when couched in national security terms. And now, India must contend with an uncertain partner in Washington, where tariff wars and energy disputes have cast doubt on the stability of what was once touted as a defining partnership. The result is an India forced to refine its playbook, seeking flexibility, developing layered tools of retaliation and deterrence, and ensuring that neither neighbor nor ally can dictate the terms of its economic future.

Year after year we hear of the same hazards seemingly striking in the same places, [be it floods in northern India or Pakistan](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6304/war-is-boring-afghan-forces-deploy-for-pakistan-flood-relief), droughts in the Horn of Africa or typhoons in the Philippines. Yet, far from the media glare, localized and low-intensity recurrent disasters wear down the resilience of communities around the world through displacement and the loss of livelihoods. Unlike in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 Pakistan earthquake or [the 2010 Haiti earthquake](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6089/haiti-relief-aid-comes-with-sovereignty-setback-attached), no foreign military assistance has been requested to respond to natural disasters in the past three years—nor forcefully offered, as happened after Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar in 2008. Nor did any disaster claim tens of thousands of lives in 2012. But even in the absence of “mega-disasters,” the human and financial consequences are massive: More than 30 million people were displaced worldwide by natural disasters in 2012; the total cost of damages was estimated at $140 billion. Meanwhile, the World Bank warns that the population of large cities exposed to tropical storms and earthquakes will more than double, from 680 million in 2000 to 1.5 billion in 2050. ## Keep reading for free Already a subscriber?

The objective of the program is to help India mitigate the risks and vulnerability of its people to natural disasters, especially cyclones. The first phase is financed through a Credit from the IDA (International Development Association), complemented with **$64 million** from the Government’s budget. India is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly earthquakes, floods, droughts, cyclones and landslides. Studies indicate that natural disaster losses equate up to 2 percent of India’s GDP and up to 12 percent of federal government revenues. About 5,700 kilometers of India’s coastline is exposed to severe cyclones and approximately 40% of India’s population lives within 100 km of the coastline. Analyzed data for the period 1980-2000 indicates that on an average, annually, 370 million people are exposed to cyclones in India. The aim of the project (NCRMP-I) is to improve early warning and communication systems; enhance capacity of local communities to respond to disasters; improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation, and protection against cyclone related hazards such as wind storms, flooding and storm surge in high risk areas; and strengthen disaster risk management capacities at the central, state and local levels. The program is expected to include at least three phases. Phase I includes the states of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Phase II will be open to the remaining high risk states or other coastal states that are ready to join. Rest of the coastal states will be covered under phase III. Each of the new phases will be appraised and approved separately to confirm the implementation readiness. This phased approach will help incorporate lessons from the earlier phases as well as include new ideas and advancements in technology in the management of risks. _“As climate change and variability become more pronounced, hazard events are set to grow, both in terms of frequency and intensity. Globally, the understanding of the role of disaster risk mitigation and preparedness initiatives in reducing the overall impacts of a disaster, has grown,”_ said **N.V.V. Raghava, World Bank Senior Infrastructure Specialist and Project Team Leader.** _“The project aims to mitigate the risks and vulnerability of coastal communities to cyclone and other hydrometeorological hazards by reducing the social, economic and financial impacts of future disasters.”_ India’s response to two of the biggest disasters in this current decade, the Gujarat earthquake and the Asian tsunami, has been efficient and very effective. Through this period, India has made great strides in moving from reactive emergency response to being proactive in implementing disaster preparedness and risk reduction initiatives. India enacted the Disaster Management Act in 2005 and established the National Disaster Management Authority and State Disaster Management Authorities. The credit is provided by the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s concessionary lending arm and has 35 years to maturity and a 10-year grace period. * * * ###### Media Contacts In Delhi Nandita Roy Tel : 91-11-41479220 [nroy@worldbank.org](mailto:nroy@worldbank.org) In Delhi Mohamad Al-Arief Tel : 91-11-41479210 [malarief@worldbank.org](mailto:malarief@worldbank.org) Karina Manasseh Tel : Manasseh [kmanasseh@worldbank.org](mailto:kmanasseh@worldbank.org) * * * ###### RELATED - [India National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (1)](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P092217?lang=en) * * * * * * - [India](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/india) - [South Asia](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar) - [Climate Change](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange) - [Fragility, Conflict and Violence](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/fragilityconflictviolence) Api ![](https://www.worldbank.org/etc/designs/wbr/clientlibs/img/loaderwb.svg) Api ![](https://www.worldbank.org/etc/designs/wbr/clientlibs/img/loaderwb.svg) * * * ###### Newsletters [Welcome](https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/bold-new-worldbankorg)",

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

The United States’ power grid, once a marvel of 20th-century engineering, is now teetering on the edge of collapse. As demand surges from emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles, an aging infrastructure struggles to keep up. Recent blackouts, escalating costs, and regulatory bottlenecks are painting a picture of a system pushed to its limits. This article explores the crisis, what investors should watch for moving forward, and the ripple effects on everyday consumers, drawing on expert analysis and recent data. ### The Cracks in the Foundation: Why the Grid is Failing ### [Are you Paying High Taxes in New Jersey, New York, or California?](https://energynewsbeat.co/invest/) America’s electrical grid was largely built in the mid-20th century, with much of its transmission and distribution infrastructure now over 50 years old. According to recent reports, the grid faces unprecedented stress from a combination of factors. Electricity demand is skyrocketing: AI data centers alone consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure projected to triple by 2028. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts electricity sales to climb from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, equivalent to adding the power needs of seven Seattle-sized cities in the next decade. Extreme weather exacerbates the vulnerabilities. Heatwaves in Texas and storms in California have triggered widespread blackouts, reminiscent of the 2003 Northeast blackout that left 50 million people in the dark. Cybersecurity threats and physical attacks on substations are on the rise, with the Department of Homeland Security emphasizing the grid’s critical status. Supply chain issues further compound the problem: lead times for large power transformers have stretched beyond 30 months by mid-2025, delaying essential upgrades. Regulatory hurdles add to the chaos. Transmission projects face five-to-seven-year delays due to permitting issues, jurisdictional disputes between utilities, states, and federal agencies, and policy gridlock. The CIRCUIT Act, introduced in February 2025 to boost domestic transformer production, remains stalled in Congress. Deloitte estimates that the U.S. power sector will require $1.4 trillion in new capital investments between 2025 and 2030 just to maintain reliability. ### Investment Opportunities: Where to Look as the Crisis Unfolds For investors, this gridlock isn’t just a headache—it’s a goldmine of opportunities. The push for modernization and reliability will favor certain sectors over others. Here’s what to watch: ### Behind-the-Meter Solutions and Companies As the centralized grid falters, decentralized “behind-the-meter” technologies—such as battery storage, microgrids, and rooftop solar—are gaining traction. These solutions allow businesses and households to generate and store power independently, reducing reliance on the main grid. Companies like Fluence Energy, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are poised for growth, with demand surging for their storage systems to handle peak loads from data centers and EVs. The Department of Energy (DOE) is allocating $32 million in 2025 for smart EV charging and distributed energy integration, signaling federal support. Investors should eye firms innovating in energy management software and modular storage, as these could see explosive adoption in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, which handles 70% of global internet traffic. ### Natural Gas and Oil Companies Reliability is king in a strained grid, and fossil fuels still provide the backbone. With coal plants retiring (e.g., Utah’s 1,800 MW Intermountain Power Project), natural gas and oil are stepping in as “bridge” fuels. The DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants to avert shortages. Natural gas firms benefit from their flexibility and lower emissions profile compared to coal, while oil companies could see upticks in backup generation demand. Look for integrated energy giants with strong midstream assets, as they can capitalize on rising wholesale prices in deregulated markets like Texas and Arizona, where cooling demands are surging. Grid UtilitiesTraditional utilities are investing heavily to shore up the system. The DOE aims to boost long-distance transmission capacity by 16% by 2030 through 7,500 miles of new lines. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion Energy, and Avangrid are leading the charge—Avangrid, for instance, plans $20 billion in investments across 23 states through 2030. These regulated utilities offer stable dividends and exposure to rate hikes as costs pass through to consumers. Independent power producers like NRG Energy are also attractive, profiting from elevated wholesale electricity prices amid supply constraints. In summary, a diversified approach makes sense: behind-the-meter for growth potential, natural gas/oil for reliability plays, and utilities for steady returns. However, risks like regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions loom large—focus on companies with strong balance sheets and innovation pipelines. ### How Consumers Will Feel the Pinch The grid’s woes will hit consumers hardest through higher bills and unreliable service. As utilities pass on upgrade costs, residential electricity prices are climbing nationwide—up about 6.5% from May 2024 to May 2025. Blackouts could become more frequent, disrupting daily life, work, and safety, especially in vulnerable areas prone to weather extremes. The impact varies by state, with some already facing exorbitant rates due to reliance on imported fuels, geography, or high demand. Below is a table of the top 10 most expensive states for residential electricity, based on EIA data for June 2025 (in cents per kWh). These states, often coastal or isolated, illustrate the uneven burden. Consumers in these states could see monthly bills exceed $200 for average usage, prompting shifts toward energy efficiency, solar adoption, or even relocation. Nationally, a Microsoft and Google-backed report warns of a shortage of 500,000 electricians in the next decade, further delaying home upgrades and EV installations. ### Looking Ahead: A Call for Action America’s grid crisis demands urgent investment and policy reform to avert catastrophe. While challenges mount, they also herald a transformation toward a smarter, more resilient energy system. Investors who position themselves wisely—balancing innovation with reliability—stand to benefit, but only if policymakers act swiftly. For consumers, the message is clear: prepare for higher costs and potential disruptions by exploring personal energy solutions today. ## [Avoid Paying Taxes in 2025](https://energynewsbeat.co/investinoil/) [Crude Oil, LNG, Jet Fuel price quote](http://energynewsbeat.co/tradingdesk/) [ENB Top News](http://energynewsbeat.co/top-news/)[ENB](http://energynewsbeat.co/) [Energy Dashboard](https://dashboard.energynewsbeat.com/?_gl=1*ij4iab*_ga*NTEyODgzNzk5LjE3MjM3Mzk2NjU.*_ga_JDVH4V200Q*MTcyNTU2OTQ3MC4xMzMxLjEuMTcyNTU2OTQ5Ny4zMy4wLjA.)

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

And what I mean by that \\[is\\] it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.”_ – Rahm Emanuel One of the great mysteries of our time is why so few media outlets or geopolitical analysts incorporate energy as a core input to their explanations of contemporary events and predictions of the future. While no single parameter is all-encompassing, energy is among the most powerful, and exploring where significant oil and gas resources and infrastructure exist often yields useful insights that defy consensus. Consider Argentina. As early as September 10th, we [postulated](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/mosaic-theory) that the US might be tempted to bail out the country, largely because it is home to one of the largest and most exciting shale oil and gas plays in the world: > “ _The Trump administration may feel compelled to mount a rearguard action in Argentina on behalf of loyal ally President Javier Milei, whose political party was roundly defeated in local elections over the weekend. Although the results do not directly impact his standing at the federal level, the electoral setback is spooking markets just as oil and gas production in the country’s massive Vaca Muerta shale resource is taking off. The country’s bonds and currency both plunged on the news._” Less than two weeks later, [things evolved](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/politics/us-argentina-bessent-javier-milei.html) as we anticipated: > “ _The Trump administration pledged on Monday to do whatever is necessary to support Argentina’s struggling economy, throwing a lifeline to the country’s embattled president, Javier Milei, ahead of legislative elections there next month._ > > _Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the United States is prepared to offer loans to Argentina’s central bank, direct currency purchases and purchases of U.S. dollar-denominated Argentine government debt from Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund to keep Argentina’s economy afloat. The value of Argentina’s currency, the peso, has fallen in recent weeks amid concerns about Mr. Milei’s political grip on government._” A deal in progress \\| Getty Over at CNN, the news unsurprisingly was framed through the lens of raw partisan politics. In an analysis titled “ [The Argentina bailout is all about propping up a Trump ally](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/business/argentina-bailout-trump-milei),” the words “oil,” “gas,” and “Vaca Muerta” don’t even merit an appearance. Instead, it all comes down to ideology: > “ _The US’s sudden love for Argentina’s economy ‘doesn’t make any sense from a realist, strategic perspective,’ Nate Schenkkan, an independent international relations expert, said in an interview. ‘This kind of stuff only really makes sense within an ideological framework.’_” If one eschews Mr. Schenkkan’s ideological framework and turns instead to brute physics and finance, the potential for significant deals to be struck between Argentina and the Trump administration appears clear. If we are right, the impact on geopolitics and energy will be substantial. Let’s make a few predictions based on the pattern of evidence. ## This post is for paid subscribers [Subscribe](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/subscribe?simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter.doomberg.com%2Fp%2Fenergy-bind%3Futm_source%3D%252Finbox%26utm_medium%3Dreader2&utm_source=paywall&utm_medium=web&utm_content=174682665) [Already a paid subscriber? **Sign in**](https://substack.com/sign-in?redirect=%2Fp%2Fenergy-bind%3Futm_source%3D%252Finbox%26utm_medium%3Dreader2&for_pub=doomberg&change_user=false) PreviousNext",

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

webchat available at **http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion** We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can.

In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. #### Tails If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called [Tails](https://tails.boum.org). Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.

Please review these basic guidelines. #### 1\\. Contact us if you have specific problems If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please [contact us](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/10/1042535_-ct-india-country-brief-111118-.html#submit_help_contact). In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations. #### 2\\. What computer to use If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer. #### 3\\. Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. #### 2\\. Act normal If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. #### 3\\. Remove traces of your submission If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion. #### 4\\. If you face legal action If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at [https://www.couragefound.org](https://www.couragefound.org). # Submit documents to WikiLeaks WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "full_text": "Financial turmoil at the Adani Group, an Indian conglomerate with close ties to the government, is unlikely to trigger a broader financial crisis in India because its total financial liabilities seem to be relatively small, though the episode may hurt Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government politically. India's Adani Group conglomerate, controlled by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, saw the value of its listed companies plunge dramatically in late January and early February after investment research suggested that Adani's businesses had used a web of shell entities to manipulate stock prices in order to issue more debt. The Adani Group has denied the allegations. This decrease in value forced the company to cancel its $2.4 billion share sale on Jan. 31, and on Feb. 6-7, Adani announced his intention to pre-pay loans, including loans backed by Adani Group shares, to calm investor sentiment and demonstrate that the conglomerate has sufficient liquidity.

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) In early fall, we examined the implications of increasing energy prices, including their potential to generate social unrest. Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Thus far, only sporadic violent plots and a few low-level attacks have targeted AI infrastructure like data centers. For the most part, pushback has taken the form of rhetoric and some nonviolent protests. The muted response reflects the fact that, for now, AI has yet to significantly demonstrate the type of grand promises or perils forecast by its dreamers or doomsdayers. This will not last. As AI ripples across societies and workplaces, upending daily life, labor markets and politics, the upheaval will inevitably spark backlash -- and at least some of the aggrieved will resort to violence.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=China%E2%80%99s+Great+Firewall+Now+Orbits+Earth %0A%0A https://stratnewsglobal.com/china/chinas-great-firewall-now-orbits-earth/) China has taken its model of digital control beyond Earth’s atmosphere with the launch of the world’s first prototype “Satellite Internet Firewall,” a development that rights advocates say represents the extension of Beijing’s Great Firewall into orbit. According to Human Rights in China (HRIC), a New York-based nongovernmental organization founded in 1989, the payload was launched on September 5, 2025, aboard a Ceres-1 (Yao-15) carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The project was developed by the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and integrates a mix of artificial intelligence, anomaly detection, on-board inspection, autonomous decision-making, and even “intelligent deception” designed to mislead potential attackers. HRIC described the launch as a milestone in China’s vision of cyber-sovereignty, with far-reaching implications for both national security and global internet governance. “By embedding censorship, surveillance logic, and active defense techniques directly into space infrastructure, China is shaping the rules of the satellite internet race in ways that challenge open-network models such as Starlink,” the group said. In a detailed account, Beiyou News, the university’s news platform, reported that the firewall payload was one of three satellites launched on September 5. The “Satellite Internet Firewall” was independently developed by the National Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications at BUPT, under the leadership of Professors Zhao Yongli and Zhang Jie, and guided by Academician Guo Shize. Beiyou News said the project marked “a historic step forward” for China in satellite internet security, describing it as the world’s first multi-dimensional integrated security payload capable of protecting both the physical and network layers of satellite internet systems. The payload integrates several advanced technologies: - Multi-dimensional rule engine for filtering and detection. - AI-powered abnormal behavior sensing to detect suspicious activity. - Onboard inspections conducted in real time. - Large-scale autonomous decision-making models capable of running 14-billion-parameter optimization tasks. - Intelligent trapping mechanisms designed to lure and study attackers. This combination allows the satellite to detect and block cyberattacks in real time, safeguarding critical business and government communications. The system reportedly has the capacity to manage traffic at 10 Gbps concurrency, with more than 70,000 threat detection rules embedded. The firewall is designed to act as the first line of defense for satellite-to-ground and intersatellite communications. By providing onboard computing power and a real-time defense orchestration environment, the payload creates what Beiyou News called “an in-orbit firewall” that protects against high-volume and sudden traffic surges. The system also conducts automatic health checks of satellite ports and key services every minute, ensuring constant monitoring and protection. By linking network-layer threat detection with physical-layer monitoring, the firewall establishes a closed-loop defense mechanism. Beiyou News emphasized that the payload represented “a comprehensive improvement” of China’s satellite internet security capabilities, blending artificial intelligence and cybersecurity technologies into a lightweight but powerful defense system. HRIC warned that the satellite firewall extends the reach of China’s censorship and surveillance regime. Unlike traditional ground-based systems, which operate within national borders, the deployment of firewalls in orbit could impact global information flows, especially if China offers “secure” satellite internet to partner states under its Belt and Road Initiative or other strategic frameworks. “Who gets to decide what information flows freely in orbit?” HRIC asked in its analysis. The group argued that embedding such technology into the very infrastructure of space networks could consolidate Beijing’s control over not only its own population but also foreign users who depend on Chinese satellite services. The rights organization also highlighted the potential conflict between China’s satellite firewall and open-network systems like SpaceX’s Starlink, which are premised on unrestricted access to the internet. The deployment of censorship logic in orbit, HRIC said, could reshape competition in the satellite internet sector by making “secure but restricted” services an exportable model. For Beijing, the launch signals both a scientific breakthrough and a political statement. The successful development of the prototype firewall demonstrates China’s ability to integrate artificial intelligence into space-based cybersecurity systems despite limited onboard resources. It also reflects the government’s long-standing goal of fusing technological advancement with national security priorities. Beiyou News noted that the project was achieved after “repeated program demonstrations, technical breakthroughs, and payload optimization.” The team overcame challenges such as limited computing power in space and the need for real-time intelligent decision-making. The news outlet described the achievement as supporting China’s mission of “serving national needs, targeting international frontiers, focusing on scientific and technological innovation, and supporting major scientific and technological projects and national security needs.” HRIC underscored the symbolic dimension of the launch: the export of the “Great Firewall” from terrestrial networks to orbital systems. What began in the 1990s as a domestic mechanism for controlling access to foreign websites has now, with the September 5 launch, reached beyond Earth’s atmosphere. By moving censorship into orbit, China is positioning itself not just as a global power in space technology but as a rule-setter in the future governance of the satellite internet. As HRIC noted, “This is a milestone in China’s vision of extending cyber-sovereignty into orbit.” ##### [Ramananda Sengupta](https://stratnewsglobal.com/author/ramananda-sengupta/) [\\+ postsBio ⮌](https://stratnewsglobal.com/stratnewsglobal.com) In a career spanning three decades and counting, Ramananda (Ram to his friends) has been the foreign editor of The Telegraph, Outlook Magazine and the New Indian Express.

(PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Political obstacles and increased winter precipitation will slow U.S. federal and state officials' response to the decline of the Colorado River until at least after the November 2024 election. Cities in the U.S. Southwest will thus initially be forced to take the lead on water restrictions, which will further undermine the desert region's attractiveness in the face of climate change and rising living costs, and negatively impact its labor market for defense and technology industries. On April 11, the U.S. Department of the Interior released three options to address the critical water shortages in the Colorado River. The first, which the Department of Interior itself suggested is unfeasible, is to allow the river to continue to decline without water cuts or adjustments in the levels of reservoirs. The second is to impose cuts equally for the seven states that utilize the river, which includes Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada,...

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ...",

The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices.
