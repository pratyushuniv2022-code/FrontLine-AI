[Articles](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/recent) India’s Prime Minister identifies the Maoist (or “Naxalite”) insurgency as India’s “single biggest internal security challenge.” The insurgency is today severe in scale and violence with 2,212 violent incidents in 2010 causing 1,175 casualties (713 civilian, 285 security force and 171 guerilla), a 63% increase since 2008. [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn1) Today, about 10,000 – 40,000 full-time insurgents wage a protracted peoples war to overthrow the Indian state across a vast “Red Corridor,” affecting 20 of India’s 28 states. India is currently waging a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoists, deploying 70,000 paramilitary police in November 2009, many to the insurgent heartland in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, where 50 percent of all attacks were recorded in 2010. [\\[ii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn2) The Maoists benefit from “two Indias living side by side.” [\\[iii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn3) India is rapidly modernizing, but many inequalities are also widening – between rich and poor, town and country and upper and lower castes. Conditions for large swathes of rural India still compare with the worst of sub-Saharan Africa, and in many remote areas the state has long been absent. However, economic grievances alone do not correlate with Maoism, and in net terms, the Indian state has tremendous internal legitimacy – only 26 of India’s 100 poorest districts, and 20 of its 100 most illiterate are Maoist afflicted. [\\[iv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn4) In truth, Maoist legitimacy is restricted to the extreme end of India’s deprivation scale – amongst the adivasis (tribals) and dalits (“untouchables”) – where in addition to extreme human misery, a broader set of social and status grievances are being inflamed. Analyst Eric Randolph astutely noted on the issue that, “People can put up with a great deal of structural violence in their lives \\[…\\] particularly when it is all they have known. Instead, what tends to trigger acts of violent rebellion are specific flashpoints of injustice.” [\\[v\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn5) For the adivasis and tribals, there are plenty such flashpoints. India’s tribals – in particular the Gonds of Central India [\\[vi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn6) – are under intense assault from state and private corporate interests, and are being pushed off their forestlands by giant hydro, logging and mining projects for little compensation and rehabilitation. The dalits, already the bottom rung of landless agricultural farmers, are similarly disproportionately impacted by the tumultuous changes of modernization on the Indian countryside, and discriminated against daily despite legislation. Tribals make up the core fighting strength of the Maoist insurgency – their narrow eight percent share of the population is still sizeable given India’s 1.2 billion peoples. The Maoist insurgency follows on a long history of peasant and tribal rebellion against predatory state structures on the subcontinent. It originated in its present form in a small village in Naxalbari, West Bengal, where in 1967, villagers armed with bows and arrows resisted police and feudal landlords with bows and arrows. [\\[vii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn7) The incident galvanized the Indian Communist movement, which found a fertile audience for its Chinese-inspired Maoist rhetoric of land reform and overthrow of feudal class structures. Militant Communism has since waxed and waned for the past half century, crushed by security forces and de-legitimized by the Indo-Chinese War of 1962, but the current phase of escalation is the strongest and most violent in history. In 2004, the two largest insurgent groups – the People’s War Group and the Maoist Communist Center – merged to form the new Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI-M). The merger elevated security hardliners in insurgent command, reiterated their commitment to violent and large-scale “peoples war,” and immediately increased insurgent kinetic activity. Today, the CPI-M accounts for 90% of attacks and 95% of fatalities from “left-wing terrorism,” according to the Indian Home Ministry. [\\[viii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn8) Maoist insurgents are tactically effective and intimately familiar with their jungle terrain. They employ classic guerilla tactics, dispersing in the face of organized force and prioritize their links with the population –often through violent intimidation. Their dispersed organizational structure mitigates the risk of being decisively impacted by targeted counterinsurgent (CI) operations. Local cells have tremendous autonomy, reflected in the fact that since 2007, six of the fourteen members of the Politburo, the highest echelon of insurgent command, have been arrested, to little discernible impact in the field. [\\[ix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn9) Unusual in COIN campaigns, Maoist guerillas have the tactical advantage over Indian security forces, and have demonstrated the ability to conduct sophisticated large-scale operations. Insurgents assault training centers and police stations to capture weaponry, attack jails to break out captured comrades and target judges and state functionaries to weaken state presence. Their lethality has grown with the use of IEDs, which now result in the majority of CI casualties. Despite a total lack of external support, the Maoists have ready access to funding – territories under their control are resource-rich and the insurgents maintain an extensive and lucrative extortion network that may net them as much as 14 billion rupees ($300 million) annually. [\\[x\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn10) Part of the insurgent “tax” is explosives used in the mining sector, which companies are often in no position to refuse. [\\[xi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn11) **A Military-Centric Response** India has grown acutely aware of the Maoist threat, but the effort to date remains vastly inadequate, both in mobilizing capacity and in implementing policy. The current counterinsurgent (CI) strategy is typically Indian – manpower-intensive and enemy-centric. It emphasizes building up force numbers to “saturate” areas with government forces and prioritizes kinetic action to suffocate the insurgency by attrition. Only lip service is paid to Western-style population-centric strategy; CI forces are present to target insurgents, not secure the population. The resultant flood of ill-trained and ill-equipped soldiers conducting large-scale sweep and commando operations has exposed civilian populations to collateral damage and abuse, increased Maoist legitimacy and recruitment, and left populations open to reprisal attacks by insurgents. As such, it likely that the scale and intensity of violence will increase in the short-term, but over the longer-term, the sheer mass of government capacity may tip the balance. Even so, brute military force is unlikely to ever fully extinguish an insurgency that is driven primarily, if not exclusively, by social and status grievances. In India’s federalist structure, states assume primary responsibility for combating Maoism, but their inadequacy has forced central “paramilitary” police forces to assume the leading COIN role. “Operation Green Hunt” launched in November 2009 deployed about 70,000 Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) personnel (split roughly evenly between combat and support staff) to reach a 2011 end-strength of 73 battalions across Maoist-affected states. [\\[xii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn12) The CRPF is India’s largest internal security force and is a resource provider of sorts for the central government – sending emergency infusions of armed police to insecure areas across the country. [\\[xiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn13) The nomenclature of “paramilitary” typically attributed to the CRPF may overestimate its true capabilities – it is nowhere close to being a specialized CI force. [\\[xiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn14) In Kashmir, some CRPF units received intensified resourcing and training allowing them to independently secure key terrain districts, [\\[xv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn15) but in net terms, the CRPF is subject to all the problems of the Indian police sector including chronic shortfalls of equipment, training, leadership, and logistical and administrative support. It struggles in basic constabulary operations – let alone open combat against a tactically proficient insurgent on home terrain. Symbolic of the challenge, some CRPF units’ still lack protective vests, even while deployed in frontline combat roles! [\\[xvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn16) For anti-Maoist operations, the CRPF is supported by other state armed police forces, i.e. those state police units trained for higher grade law and order problems, including India Reserve Battalions (IRB). These forces are more competent than the regular police, but there is generally a net decline in combat capacity, discipline and professionalism down the hierarchy of security institutions. Scale, capacity and terrain challenges severely hamper the CI force. 70,000 troops cannot by themselves realistically expect to affect any measurable difference over a population of at least 450 million people across 1.86 million square kilometers of tough, remote terrain [\\[xvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn17) – especially without adequate support from effective civil police for regular law and order functions. The UN recommends a peacetime police-to-population ratio of 222 policemen per 100,000 members of the population, which India – and especially its insurgency-affected areas – falls far short of. [\\[xviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn18) In the Maoist heartland of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, new figures show their police-to-population ratios at 226 and 206 in 2010, [\\[xix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn19) a dramatic improvement (at least on paper) from 2000, when the ratio was a mere 50! [\\[xx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn20) Other states lag far behind. Orissa remains at 136, West Bengal at 100, and Bihar at just 74. [\\[xxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn21) Numbers tell only part of the story. Indian police are notoriously corrupt and brutal by Western standards. Draconian sedition laws punish even the semblance of sympathy for the Maoist cause, [\\[xxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn22) and anti-Maoist operations regularly leave behind a trail of destruction – including serious abuses such as torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and rape. [\\[xxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn23) In the field many units – other than some elite forces – are tactically outmatched. Maoists benefit from the guerilla’s ability to choose the time and place of engagement, allowing them to confront the state at its weakest points. Coordinated attacks have penetrated high-security areas with relative impunity, but most notable was the 2010 Maoist ambush in Dantewada that killed 76 soldiers of the 62nd CRPF Battalion, the single largest loss of life in Indian COIN history. The event deeply undercut the Indian government’s claims of progress, and revealed systemic failures. 62 Bn. had served previously in anti-Naxal operations in Bihar, but like other CRPF units was shifted in an ad hoc manner on the basis of availability rather than suitability for the mission. As a result, it failed to acclimatize to the local physical and human terrain, evident when the force found itself trapped on a narrow jungle path. An IED was able to halt the entire column by disabling the lead vehicle, and well-positioned guerillas prevented any retaliatory maneuver. [\\[xxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn24) Chronic deficiencies in leadership were also evident – not uncommon in a force that sees its best officers poached by other agencies. [\\[xxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn25) The unit commander reportedly lied about his position to avoid a long-range field patrol, and failed to report a lost radio that likely allowed guerillas to track to column over several days. [\\[xxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn26) Insurgent intelligence dominance was easily evident – the Maoists were able to maneuver 1,000 men into place without detection, no doubt benefiting from at least some local support. Dantewada was an exceptional incident, but there are a legion other equipment and training challenges that limit CI abilities. Drastic expansion in force size has come without a commensurate emphasis on building up an adequate support base. Troops are barracked in terrible living conditions and there is widespread resentment at the perceived lack of political support, as well as the lack of clarity and resources with which to conduct their missions. Force protection is low, especially against IEDs. Deployed counter-IED equipment is limited [\\[xxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn27) and current armored vehicles provide inadequate protection, forcing a reliance on vulnerable dismounted patrols. New armored vehicles are being introduced – but Maoists have generally adapted by increasing the size of their bombs. [\\[xxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn28) Unsurprisingly, morale is low. One soldier angrily declared to an embedded reporter, “Have you ever seen a war being fought like this? We don’t know if we are here to assist the state police on law and order or to flush out Naxals, or merely to oscillate between troubled territories, getting our jawans (soldiers) killed for no fault of theirs.” [\\[xxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn29) He went on to point out various shortcomings including inadequate and sporadic rations, virtually no support for injured and killed soldiers, and points out that even “when I go on leave or when I am on my way back home \\[from camp\\], I travel that distance at the mercy of God or the Naxals. What morale are you talking about?” [\\[xxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn30) Despite their tactical capabilities, Maoists adhere to classic guerilla tactics, readily ceding territory in the face of organized state offensives, even “liberated areas” such as Lalgarh district. Their mobility and trans-bordered nature allows them to exploit weak intra-state cooperation, making border areas between states particularly troublesome. Some states such as Chhattisgarh have multiple tri-junctions – where the borders of three states meet – allowing insurgents to mount attacks across state lines before retreating to safe havens. [\\[xxxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn31) Success in one state – such as Andhra Pradesh – may only displace insurgents into others; the neighboring states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh have seen significant spikes in violence since. Several initiatives have been unveiled to overcome the jurisdictional conflicts that plague effective trans-border policing, most notably by creating unified commands in insurgency-affected states. Designed to act as ‘fusion centers’ to facilitate cooperation between states, between state and federal forces, and between civilian and military personnel, their result has so far been underwhelming, not least because of the pushback from many state and local governments. On the local level, a political-criminal interface ensures that many politicians are eager to collude with Maoists and profit from their control of mines and resources. In some states – such as Jharkhand and Bihar – political rivalries mean that states refuse to cooperate with federal efforts, and in others, leaders collude with the Maoists for self-preservation. In West Bengal, the state government has greatly slowed CI activity and all but allowed a Maoist sanctuary earning them greatly reduced levels of violence in the state, but damaging the overall COIN effort. [\\[xxxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn32) The easy availability of central forces has also resulted in many states neglecting their own police modernization efforts. Unsurprisingly, simply augmenting force numbers has not paid dividends. Chhattisgarh and Jharkand both saw insurgent attacks rise despite a police surge, whereas in Andhra Pradesh, the state which has most effectively combated Maoists, the police force in population terms remained constant. Credit for reversing insurgent momentum is generally given to the state’s elite ‘Greyhound’ force built to live and operate in the jungle as the guerilla did, and fight the Indian jungle equivalent of a “bush war.” The force’s 1,000 personnel across 30 “assault units,” benefited from rigorous training and superior equipment (particularly communications technology) and were able to rapidly deploy and effectively operate on Maoist terrain. The Greyhounds have been extremely effective, but they did not operate in a vacuum. Beyond elite forces, Andhra Pradesh pursued an effective state police capacity-building effort, spreading tactically trained personnel across the force, and building synergistic relationships between the district police, intelligence assets and the Greyhounds. [\\[xxxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn33) The state also benefited from focused efforts to improve its COIN doctrine. It coordinated police strategies, created fortified police districts in vulnerable areas, improved intelligence sharing between security agencies, [\\[xxxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn34) cross-trained regular police units with elite police commando forces, and measurably implemented well-crafted community development programs. Unfortunately through the militarized lens of India’s COIN campaign, only the warfighting elements of Andhra Pradesh’s strategy have been replicated with earnest. The CRPF is raising ten Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA) battalions to reach an envisioned end-strength of about 10,000 men. [\\[xxxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn35) COBRA battalions are expected to be some of the best-equipped paramilitary troops in the country, and are trained specifically for the Maoist fight. They are armed like a regular Army infantry platoon and are trained in counter-guerilla and jungle warfare operations at the elite Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS), the Indian Army’s premier unconventional warfare training institution. State police forces – such as the India Reserve (IR) battalions are also are tasked with raising two companies of specialized ‘commando’ forces per battalion [\\[xxxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn36) \\- and more state police forces are being given at least some advanced warfare training. This militarization of the police may yield results in terms of removing insurgents from the field, but comes with the tradeoff in diverting attention and resources away from the equally crucial task of increasing and professionalizing regular policing capacity to “hold” cleared territory. Another worrying trend has been the outsourcing of security responsibilities to auxiliary non-state militias that operate with little oversight, training or accountability, and yet are deputized under the aegis of ‘Special Police Officers’ (SPOs) with official government sanction. Most prominent was the Salwa Judum (literally translated to “Purification Hunt” in the local Gondi dialect), a Chhattisgarh government-sponsored and equipped militia of about 5,000 lightly armed tribal people. Salwa Judum may have benefited from support and funding from mining companies, and was widely accused of extreme human rights abuses including forcible displacements of villages, killings and rape. In response, in July 2011, the Indian Supreme Court declared SPOs illegal and unconstitutional and ordered their disbandment. Indian security officials had routinely justified these forces as helping them ‘localize’ their force presence, build up human intelligence networks and provide alternative employment opportunities for tribal youth. They came, however, with substantial tradeoffs including the militarization of tribal society and the emergence of ‘warlords’ who maintain control over refugee camps and swathes of territory – making disbandment and reintegration difficult. [\\[xxxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn37) However, despite their record, SPOs did provide an important “force multiplier” for culturally foreign CI forces, and their replacement with regular police will take time – by some accounts at least a year. [\\[xxxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn38) Moreover even if SPOs are abandoned fully – itself a dubious prospect – other shadowy vigilante groups also exist, including the several “Cobra” organizations in Andhra Pradesh that retaliate against Maoist violence, particularly if committed against military and government officials. [\\[xxxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn39) As detailed, Indian CI forces suffer many capacity shortfalls that impede their operational effectiveness, but major reforms are currently ongoing that could significantly increase the quality of anti-Maoist CI forces. Israeli assault rifles are being purchased, [\\[xl\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn40) helicopters being redeployed back from peacekeeping missions ostensibly for anti-Maoist operations, [\\[xli\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn41) and retired army soldiers being recruited as trainers. [\\[xlii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn42) Two of three sanctioned UAVs have been inducted to improve ISR capabilities and detect massed insurgent forces – although forested terrain restricts their utility [\\[xliii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn43) \\- and a variety of other new equipment is being inducted. All these if utilized effectively can improve the CI capacity to kill insurgents, but it is less certain that they can strategically end the insurgency. **Inadequate Social, Political and Economic Redress** The Indian state has focused on combating the insurgency by military means, but addressing the legitimate economic and social grievances of tribal peoples has been less forthcoming. Rural development in India comes with significant scale challenges, affecting 1/3rd of the entire world’s poor and traversing remote areas where the government has traditionally been absent. Improving tribal welfare is a component of the broader growth and modernization of India, and as such competes with a host of other priorities. Development projects come with sizeable time-lags that must be factored in – effective policy will require sustained funding and attention over a period of years without immediately apparent results. Development must be recognized for the offensive weapon that it is – both in attacking insurgent legitimacy and in binding tribals to the Indian state by destroying their earlier forms of social existence. [\\[xliv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn44) Moreover, it is not a panacea. Efforts to raise economic and human welfare standards must come alongside broader reforms in social justice and local governance to mitigate predatory and corrupt local administrative structures. It is not for nothing that the insurgent heartland in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand corresponds with the two worst governed states in the country. [\\[xlv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn45) Tighter regulation of private industry is also necessary, including measures to ensure rehabilitation for those displaced by mining projects, and efforts to compensate for and mitigate the ecological and social impacts of extraction. India has admittedly prioritized rural development – elevating its ministry to a cabinet level position in 2011 – and significantly increased allocations to Maoist-affected areas through targeted entitlements. However, rural development to date has been superficial and ineffective, with emphasis on increased allocations obscuring problems in implementation and a lack of progress towards desired outcomes. The Maoist Integrated Action Plan for example provided 250 million rupees in 2010, and 300 million in 2011 in discretionary funds for quick-impact human welfare projects including building facilities for drinking water, sanitation, health clinics, roads etc. Data to date, however, suggests that only a quarter of allocated money has been spent and only 15 percent of projects completed. [\\[xlvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn46) This is despite the obvious fact that sincere development is appreciated – in February 2011 the Maoist abduction of a district collector known for being an efficient and honest administrator led to tribal rallies and protests, forcing his release [\\[xlvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn47) There is, however, a prevalent belief that current patterns of insecurity dictate that stabilization must precede development. This is not an unreasonable view – it is obviously difficult to develop territory you do not control and the Maoists recognize that development can erode their control. As such, insurgents have targeted 1,241 ‘economic targets’ between 2007 and 2011, including roads, power plants, telephone towers etc. [\\[xlviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn48) Such targeting is entirely self-interested, seeking to keep communities isolated and insulated from the relief efforts and ensuring that Maoists are the sole providers of social services. Human Rights Watch for example details how Maoists shut down rural schools to create captive recruiting pools for their Bal Sangam child-brigades. [\\[xlix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn49) Government agents are prime Maoist targets, severely complicating outreach. CI forces have attempted to mitigate this problem by recently unveiling plans for seven new battalions of “specialized forces” that integrate engineering and security personnel. [\\[l\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn50) There are islands of success, but overall reconstruction and aid delivery efforts in Central India leave much to be desired. Plans look good on paper; the Saranda Action Plan for example seeks to build on successful clear operations with a series of entitlement plans – including issuing ration cards for the poor, creating rural work schemes and developing infrastructure to connect isolated communities. [\\[li\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn51) Unfortunately, many of these policies fail to be implemented effectively and a large proportion of allocated funds are leaked to inefficiency, corruption and the incompetence of the state machinery. Corruption in particular is not a side effect that can be ignored – the nexus between corrupt politicians, private industry and Maoists is a key driver of both tribal alienation from the state, as well as a major facilitator of insurgent freedom of action. Much development money is also believed to flow to Maoist hands in the form of protection money paid by reconstruction firms. **Lessons Learned** 1) Skewed priority of effort – The mission fails to integrate military and civilian efforts, and prioritizes tactical military decisions that may in many cases have strategic tradeoffs. Development and political outreach is tainted by police brutality, and ineffective military operations are a major driver of Maoist mobilization. Military missions must be designed and conducted carefully to minimize civilian alienation, and must be viewed as precursors for post-“clear” development and reconstruction. Civilian and military coordination must improve and emphasis must be placed on improving the conduct of security forces. 2) Over-Militarization of Police – The emphasis on building up paramilitary forces capable of taking the fight to the Maoists should not detract from efforts to build up competent civil police. Kinetic operations must be merely a prelude to a viable rule of law, which will require building up capacities in not just the civil police, but also the supporting justice and detention sectors. 3) Mobilize Scarce Assets – The Indian Army has rightly assessed that it is not trained or equipped to combat its own people, but it is the only Indian institution with the specialized capacity that could tip the Maoist fight. Aerial assets can improve ISR coverage, equipment such as counter-IED kits and armored vehicles can reduce police casualties, and Army trainers and facilities are the best available resource to build up small-unit combat capabilities and disseminate tactical lessons learnt from other theaters. 4) Improve unity of effort – The insurgency crosses borders, and so must the CI effort. Focus must be given to improving coordination between the many state and central agencies involved, and between states. The goal should be to create effective border management protocols that prevent insurgents from locating safe havens to regroup. 5) Attack insurgent legitimacy – CI actions should best sell their mission, but strategic communications can highlight Maoist complicity in corruption, extortion, and violent abuse at the expense of tribal communities. This is most viable if CI forces themselves adhere to tighter ethical codes of conducts than insurgents – not currently true. 6) Empower non-state actors with care – Actors such as Salwa Judum deeply de-legitimize the state and taint it by association. Especially in India, the population cannot easily distinguish between police branches or between formal and informal forces, and brutalities reinforce the predominant image of the Indian state as callous and predatory. 7) Improve the effectiveness of aid delivery – There must be a focus on outcomes over allocations. Emphasis should be paid on ensuring that projects are completed on time and to standard, and continual oversight should mitigate leakages. Projects should be visible and have immediate impact, and local communities must be involved from project design to completion. 8) Governance reform – Corruption and local predatory state structures are drivers of Maoist legitimacy and mobilization. A major facilitator of the insurgency is the willingness of local politicians to collude with Maoists and/or private industry at the expense of their constituents, and to enact self-interested policies that weaken the mission. Measures such as the sedition laws would be better suited to tackle direct support such as this, rather than human-right workers and ordinary civilians whose only crime is to extend moral support. 9) Aid is insufficient – Aid and quick-impact projects can only alleviate immediate needs. Broader economic and social reforms must be tackled with real urgency. A culture of impunity and blatant corruption must end; for politicians, police, and business elites, and inequalities between rich and poor and town and country must ease. Targeting Maoist-affected areas with increased funding and attention is probably good policy, but it is likely not an overstatement to say anti-Maoist success will correlate significantly with India’s progress in caring for its poorest peoples. * * * [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_ednref1) “Annual Report 2010-2011,” _Ministry of Home Affairs Republic Of India_, Available at [www.mha.nic.in](http://www.mha.nic.in/); “2010 bloodiest year for India’s Maoist rebellion,” _AFP,_ January 5, 2011.

This amorphous group of self-proclaimed \"Maoist\" revolutionaries known collectively as Naxalites was dedicated to the armed overthrow of the existing system of government. Their use of violence taxed the resonrces of the security forces. The Naxalite movement contained several often-competing organizations that were tied together only by common rejection of the existing social and gcvernmental systems in India and reliance on violence to achieve their goals. T he Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. The modus operandi of the Naxalites typically consisted of organizing the very poor and the landless and goading them into acts of terrorism or the forceable occupation and cultivation of land held usually by large, but sometimes by small landowners. Peasants were encouraged to \"annihilate\" class enemies and to engage in other activities to \"render ineffective the state apparatus\" in their areas. The Naxalites refuse to participate in the parliamentary process and denounce all groups, including other Communist parties, that do. In their thinking, \"the only way to achieve liberation is by force of arms to overthrow the four main enemies -- US imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, their bureaucratic,and bourgeoise lackeys, and the feudal landlords.\" The number of India's youthful, educated unemployed continued to increase, and, paradoxically, the success of the \"green revolution\" in agriculture pointed up the growing disparities between landed peasants who were benefiting from better harvests and poor peasants whose prospects for acquiring land were practically nil. Both students and peasants had become increasingly impatient with the unfulfilled promises of the traditional political parties and, by the same token, are more easily seduced by the call to violent revolution and the immediate, tangible rewards it seems to offer. The Naxalites made a calculated effort to demolish national heroes - Mahatma Gandhi in particular - as a demonstration of their contempt for \"bourgeois ideas.\" These iconoclastic actions plus their hit-and-run tactics and their spectacular exploits -- bombings; murders; book burnings; attacks upon police stations, movie houses, and libraries -- gave the Naxalite movement newspaper headlines from which it derived both inspiration and new recruits. In December 2020, the Chhattisgarh government reported that 216 Maoist fighters were killed in the state over the course of three years, and 966 surrendered. A battle in India�s central Chhattisgarh state left 22 security personnel dead and 31 wounded, according to police. The Times of India (TOI) newspaper, meanwhile, reported that 32 were injured and one officer was missing following the firefight. According to the TOI, more than 2,000 officers went on an anti-Maoist raid on 02 April 2021. The government force included elite CoBRA jungle warfare unit, which is part of the police. On September 15, 2011, news media reported that the Indian Union Home Minister stated that left-wing extremism (Naxalism) is the most violent movement in the country and that the Communist Party of India (CPI Maoist), the primary Naxalite group, is the most violent organization in the country. The Naxalites have a long history of conflict with state and national authorities, including frequent attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials. Inspired by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung, the insurgents, called Naxals, have been fighting in eastern and central India for decades, demanding more jobs and resources for farmers and the poor, using violent acts including bombings, and hit and run attacks against authorities. India�s Maoist groups have their roots in the peasant movement of Andhra Pradesh following independence, but were later radicalized with the introduction of Maoist ideologies. Several groups merged in 2004 to form India�s Maoist Communist Party, which seeks to overthrow the government and bring about their definition of a classless society. Although that group is banned, India has several other communist parties that are regularly elected to positions in parliament and the legislature. Since the Maoist/Naxal threat was not secessionist, but rather one of law and order the police and state governments, and not the military, bore the responsibility for addressing the challenge. The military could, and is, working on a limited basis with the police in an advisory or training capacity, but they are not involved in active, kinetic operations. However, the military is monitoring the threat to ensure that it does not get out of hand. Disputes over land and natural resources are pervasive in India. The courts are clogged with unsettled land disputes. In the eastern and northeastern states of India, conflicts over forests and agricultural lands have their roots in longstanding inter-communal, ethnic and separatist conflicts. In Scheduled Tribes \\[ST\\] areas, disputes related to the illegal alienation of ST land to non-tribal people are common. In several central and northeastern states, large companies have purchased land and mineral rights from state governments, which has contributed to the growth of a well-armed Maoist insurgency known as the Naxalites. In India today there are many Maoist parties and organizations that either predate the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or emerged from factions when the CPI-ML split after the death of Charu Majumdar. Three of them, the CPI-ML (People's War), CPI-ML (Party Unity), and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC), are currently engaged in armed struggle. An inter-connected \"Naxalite belt\" stretches across central India, comprising Bihar, MP, Orissa, AP, Maharashtra and parts of Tamil Nadu. Those parts which were connected to the neighboring states came under the influence of Naxalism. Its members are called Naxalites after the eastern Indian town of Naxalbari, where their movement originated in 1967. The 25 May 1967 peasant uprising at Naxalbari in Darjeeling district of West Bengal began under the leadership of revolutionary communists belonging to the Communist Party of India - Marxist \\[CPI (M)\\]. The uprising was brutally suppressed by the CPI (M)-led United Front government of West Bengal at the behest of the Congress government at the Center. In reaction, communist revolutionary ranks rebel against the leadership of the party. The rebellion soon assumes an all India dimension. Entire state units of CPI (M) in Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir and considerable sections in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh joined this rebellion. On 22 April 1969 they formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). Since 1980 clashes between police and Naxalite Maoist revolutionaries have taken place in northwestern Andhra Pradesh. In areas under their control, Naxalites dispense summary justice in \"people's courts\" which in some cases condemn to death suspected police informers, village headmen, and others deemed to be \"class enemies\" or \"caste oppressors.\" The Naxalites extort money from business firms, and railway services in one area had to be canceled in July and August due to PWG destruction of stations, track and signaling equipment. Over the past few years, hundreds of policemen and suspected Naxalites have been killed, according to press reports and human rights organization. As of September 1998 police had killed 102 Naxalites in approximately 80 \"encounters.\" Decades of guerrilla-style conflict have led to serious human rights abuses by both sides. Human rights groups allege that \"encounters\" are usually faked by the police to cover up the torture and subsequent murder of Naxalite suspects, sympathizers, or informers. These groups cite as evidence the refusal of police to hand over corpses of suspects killed in \"encounters,\" which are often cremated before families can view the bodies. Andhra police have contributed to the establishment of an armed vigilante group known as the \"Green Tigers,\" whose mission is to combat Naxalite groups in the state. The NHRC is investigating some 285 reported cases so-called \"fake encounter deaths\" allegedly committed by the Andhra police in connection with anti-Naxalite operations. Between 1999 and 2001, several hundred deaths a year were attributed to Naxalite/ government fighting and activities. The revolutionaries sought to carve out a \"Compact Revolutionary Zone\"; however their efforts were suppressed by the Indian and Nepalese governments. In February, 2002 the Home Ministry held several rounds of talks with the state government of Andhra Pradesh and a representative of the Peoples War Group. In June 2002, the group withdrew from those talks following a police encounter. By May of 2003, tensions seemed to ease. The Naxalite revolutionaries had not been violently active in the preceding 4 months, and the Indian Government appeared committed to implementing the 1997 act which stipulated improvement for the Naxalite population. The government decided to reduce the number of police forces in the area, and agreed to unconditional talks with the revolutionaries. An assassination attempt against Chief Minster Naidu of Andhra Pradesh marked a serious downturn in the peace process and PWG and the police to step up their activities. In 2004 a government three month long cease-fire and a temporary lifting of a ban of the PWG failed to result in a long term peace agreement. More than 500 people were killed in 2004 in sporadic low-intensity conflict. 2004 also marked an important political development in the Naxalite movement. During the final months of 2004 the PWG merged with the Maoist Communist Center of India, creating the Communist Party of India (Maoist), becomming the largest Maoist rebel group with operations in over 9 states. This group also stepped up cross border relations with Nepal's Maoists. In the wake of the breakdown of the peace process between the PWG and the Andhra Pradesh state government in 2004, the fighting between government and Naxalite forces increased in 2005. While the fighting remained low-intensity and sporadic in nature, over 700 people were killed, a third of whom were civilians. In 2005 the Chhattisgarh state government enacted the Special Public Security Act (SPSA), which permits detention for as long as three years for loosely defined unlawful activities. Human rights groups voiced concerns that the law criminalizes any support given to Naxalites (Maoists), even support provided under duress. In July, 2006 violence between Naxalites and government forces increased significantly. On July 17, an armed group of approximately 800 Naxalites attacked a relief camp in Dantewada killing at least 25 people and wounding 80 more. It is believed that the Naxalites staged their attack from the Andhra Pradesh state. The relief camp targeted provided shelter to over four thousand internally displaced persons. Four Naxalites were reportedly killed in retaliatory fire. On July 23, 2006 in what was claimed as a major blow against Andhra Pradesh Naxalite forces, the Naxalite leader of the Andhra Pradesh state was killed in a raid along with seven other people by police in the Prakasam district. From 2002-2006 over three thousand people had been killed in Naxalite-goverment conflicts. In central and eastern India, armed conflicts between Naxalite (Maoist) insurgents and government security forces over land and mineral resources in tribal forest areas continued, affecting 182 of the country�s 626 districts in 20 of its 28 states. Most of the conflict areas overlap with the Dandakaranya forest, which covers parts of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The forest also has large deposits of mineral resources, such as bauxite, iron ore, and uranium, and is home to millions of tribal persons. The Ministry of Rural Development in 2009 estimated that up to 400,000 persons had been displaced since the conflict began. During the year �Operation Green Hunt,� the government�s initiative against Naxalites in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa, and West Bengal, continued. Human rights advocates argued that the operation sought not only to suppress the Naxalites but also to force these tribal persons off their land, allowing for commercial development. In central India, armed conflict over land and mineral resources in tribal forest areas continued into 2010. Fighting between Naxalite (or Maoist) insurgents and government security forces supported by Salwa Judum militia and Special Police Officers affected more than 200 of India�s 626 districts in 20 of its 29 states in mid-2010. By March 2009, the conflict had displaced 350,000 members of tribal groups, and over 100,000 were believed to have been displaced between mid-2009 and mid-2010. IDP camps that opened in Chhattisgarh for displaced tribal persons caught in fighting between Naxalites and the Salwa Judum in 2006 continued to operate. On 05 July 2011, the Supreme Court pronounced the state-sponsored militia Salwa Judum �illegal and unconstitutional� and directed the government of Chhattisgarh to disband the operation. In addition the court asked Chhattisgarh to immediately cease and desist from using as SPOs tribal persons who had been chosen from Salwa Judum camps against Naxalites in the state, and to recall all firearms issued to SPOs. The Chhattisgarh government was ordered to stop issuing funds in support of SPO recruitment. Following the July 5 judgment, the Chhattisgarh government claimed to have disbanded the Salwa Judum. By September approximately 50,000 tribal persons displaced by the Salwa Judum had returned to their villages. Approximately 15,000 tribal persons remained in 15 Salwa Judum camps. During 2011 India�s armed forces, individual states� security forces, and paramilitary forces continued to engage in armed conflict with insurgent groups in Jammu and Kashmir, several northeastern states, and the Naxalite belt in the central and eastern parts of the country. There was considerably less violence in Jammu and Kashmir than in previous years. Although army and central and state paramilitary forces remained deployed in some states of the northeast and in West Bengal�s Naxalite belt, by year�s end most of the northeast insurgent groups were involved in peace negotiations with the central government. In Naxalite (Maoist) affected districts, there were reports of excessive use of force by security agencies. For example, in the Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh, Koya Commandos, an armed wing of �tribals�--an indigenous group operating with the state government�s approval as SPOs--and CRPF personnel attacked three villages between March 11 and March 16 in search of Maoists. Civil society activists reported that three tribal members were killed and three women were sexually assaulted. The security forces also burned approximately 300 tribal homes. Initially the Chhattisgarh government refused to order a probe into the incident and transferred a top government official in Dantewada who tried to send relief material to the villagers. Human rights activist Swami Agnivesh and journalists who attempted to visit the villages were attacked by SPOs. After severe criticism in the media and a protest by human rights activists, the government responded by transferring a police officer involved in the attack on Agnivesh and ordered a judicial probe. On July 5, unsatisfied by the judicial probe and affidavits filed by the Chhattisgarh government, the Supreme Court ordered the CBI to probe the incident. The CBI did not complete the probe by the end of 2011. Naxalites abducted individuals during 2011. For example, on February 16, a group of 50 Naxals in Orissa kidnapped Indian Administrative Services officer RV Krishna and junior engineer Pabitra Majhi. They were released on February 24, after the Orissa government accepted the Naxalites� demands. There was no evidence that insurgent forces made attempts to prevent or punish human rights violations by their members. There were no reports of deliberate attacks on government hospitals, primary health centers, workers, ambulances, or patients, nor were there restrictions on accessing medical facilities in the Naxal areas of Chattisgarh and Maharashtra. However, there were recorded attacks and explosions at schools, roads and railways tracks. There were no attacks on medical services or Below Poverty Line ration shops. In Chhattisgarh Maoists continued to attack security forces and civilians, killing 13 CRPF personnel in Dantewada District on June 10 and 12. On 19 August 2011, Maoists killed 11 policemen and one civilian in Bijapur District. In Assam there were six incidents during the year of bomb explosions, although no deaths were reported. One explosion, in Kamrup (Rural) District, engineered by the Adivasi People�s Army, injured 100 persons. On 07 January 2011, in Netai Village, part of West Bengal�s Maoist-dominated West Midnapore District, nine persons died when armed Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) workers fired at 2,000 villagers gathering around the house of a CPI-M party leader. This was the bloodiest incident in West Bengal since March 2007, when police killed 14 villagers in Nandigram. The CBI investigated and charged several local and district CPI-M leaders. In response to allegations of Maoist involvement in the incident, the Maoist-backed People�s Committee Against Police Atrocities spokesman argued that the villagers organized themselves to destroy the �harmad� (armed goons) camps, something the administration failed to do. The South Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP), run by the nonprofit Institute for Conflict Management, database reported that during the year 2011 at least 480 persons--including 182 militants, 99 security force personnel, and 199 civilians--were killed as a result of Naxalite (Maoist) violence, a decrease from 2010, when 212 militants, 250 security force personnel, and 528 civilians were killed. According to the SATP database, in 2012 total terrorism or insurgency related fatalities continued to decrease from the previous year. The total deaths reported declined from 1,073 in 2011 to 804 in 2012 (252 civilians, 139 security personnel, and 413 militants). The SATP database reported that 368 persons--including 118 militants, 104 security force personnel, and 146 civilians--were killed during the year as a result of Naxalite (Maoist) violence, a decrease from 2011, when 199 militants, 128 security force personnel, and 275 civilians were killed. The Institute for Conflict Management reported that there were 117 fatalities in Jammu and Kashmir during the year, including 84 alleged terrorists, 17 members of the security forces, and 16 civilians. During the year 2013 the SATP reported 589 fatalities due to terrorism and insurgency (other than Maoist extremism), including 297 civilians, 192 security force members, and 390 terrorists. According to the SATP fatalities due to terrorist violence in the Northeastern States decreased from 316 deaths in 2012 to 271. Fatalities from terrorist violence in Jammu and Kashmir, however, increased from 117 deaths in 2012 to 181 as of December 29. The SATP database reported that 419 persons, including 110 security force personnel, 158 civilians, and 151 Maoist militants, were killed during the year as a result of Naxalite (Maoist) violence, an increase from 2012 when 104 security force personnel, 146 civilians, and 117 Maoist insurgents were killed. The Institute for Conflict Management reported 181 fatalities in Jammu and Kashmir during the year, including 61 security forces persons, 20 civilians, and 100 terrorists. In Naxalite (Maoist) affected districts, there were reports of excessive use of force by security agencies and insurgents. For example, on July 7, Maharashtra police killed six suspected Naxal women in Mendhari village, in Gadchiroli District. After a fact-finding mission, the human rights NGO Coordination of Democratic Rights Organization filed a complaint alleging that police killed the women in captivity after they asked to surrender. Police denied the allegation, and the government of Maharashtra ordered a judicial inquiry. On 25 May 2013, Naxalites killed 29 Congress Party activists in an ambush of the Chhattisgarh Congress� election convoy in Jhiram Ghati (Darbha Valley) in the Bastar region of South Chhattisgarh. Naxalites kidnapped and killed Chhattisgarh state President Nand Kumar Patel, Congress leader Mahendra Karma, and the founder of the disbanded anti-Naxal paramilitary force, Salwa Judum. This was the first Naxal attack on a political group in the Naxal-dominated region of central India. In Maharashtra 45 persons were killed, including seven security personnel, 10 civilians, and 28 insurgents. Insurgents killed three former Salwa Judum members in Chhattisgarh and one in Maharashtra during the year. (In 2011 the Supreme Court disbanded the Salwa Judum militia.) The Indian government vowed in January 2015 to unleash a massive offensive against Maoist rebels in five central and eastern Indian states, which had been most hit by the Maoist insurgency. But there were voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalised and largely indigenous populations in the worst-affected states. In July 2016 the insurgents killed 10 paramilitary soldiers in an ambush in eastern Bihar state. Eight of the officers were killed instantly when the rebels detonated several homemade explosives. A few months later Indian police forces tracked down and killed 24 Maoist rebels in a midnight gunfight in Odisha, the most casualties the group suffered that year. On 02 February 2017, authorities reported that Maoist rebels in eastern India are suspected in the deaths of at least eight police officers killed in a landmine blast. According to senior police officer K.B. Singh, another five officers sustained injuries after their vehicle was attacked in the Koraput region. Police sources said that four bodies were recovered at the scene, while four others died later at a hospital. The 13-man team of young recruits were on their way to Cuttack to be trained as police drivers. Seven Naxalites including two women were killed in an encounter with security forces in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur district on 12 December 2024. Personnel of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) from Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bastar and Kondagaon districts, Special Task Force (STF) of the state police, and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were involved in the operation. Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai hailed the security forces for the operation and said the fight against Naxalism will continue till it is completely eliminated. With this incident, at least 215 Naxalites have been killed in encounters so far this year in the Bastar division of the state. Naxalite movement appears to have lost its steam in Palamu, once known as the den of Maoists, who used to scare away innocents in the forested hinterlands of this Jharkhand district. Thanks to constant vigil and other strict measures, which are keeping the Naxalites and their sympathisers at bay. apart from a known method like combing operations, another strategy which clicked in taming the Naxalites is going for character certificates of suspected people. Cautious youth who want to land jobs to eke out a living for themselves are choosing to stay away from criminal activities and boycotting Naxals. In a significant statement marking a milestone in the fight against Naxalism, Jharkhand's newly appointed Director General of Police (DGP) Anurag Gupta announced 09 December 2024 that 95% of the Naxal issue in the state has been resolved. However, he acknowledged that the remaining 5% is concentrated in the Chaibasa district, where intensified operations are underway to eradicate the menace completely. Union Home Minister Amit Shah on 10 December 2024 said the BJP-led government at the Centre succeeded in bringing down violence in Jammu and Kashmir, North-East and Naxal-hit areas by 70 per cent in the last 10 years. Amit Shah visited Chhattisgarh from 13 to 15 December 2024. In an August 2024 meeting on anti-Naxal operations, Shah warned the Maoists, saying that they must either \"surrender or be ready to face dire consequences\". So far in 2024, at lesat 207 Maoists had been killed in Chhattisgarh, a significant rise from the 22 killed in 2023. Chhattisgarh police will be deploying at least four new battalions of the paramilitary forces, around 2,800 personnel, in a couple of months in the war-zone Bastar region, officials familiar with the development said 14 August 2024. Officials said that to counter Maoist violence in the region, these forces will be deployed mainly in the intersections of Sukma and Bijapur districts. �Four battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force have been sanctioned by the Union government, and we are planning to deploy them in Sukma and Bijapur districts. The aim is to counter the violence of Battalion number 1 of Maoists, which is responsible for all major attacks in the last 15 years,� said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity. One battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) consists of at least 700 personnel, which means around 2,800 personnel will be in this area in the next few months, officials said. �We believe that Naxalism is the biggest challenge for the democratic system in our nation. In the last four decades, 17,000 people lost their lives because of Naxalism. Since PM Modi-led BJP came to power at the Centre, we have accepted this as a challenge and tried to bring those who have weapons in the hands (Naxalites) into the mainstream,� Union Home Minister Amit Shah said at a briefing 24 August 2024. �100% saturation of Central govt and Chhattisgarh govt's schemes in the naxal affected areas, the progress of infrastructure projects in such areas and to remove the challenges faced during such projects, this meeting was for that,\" he added. �We have neutralised Naxal leaders, and have worked with two objectives - first was to establish Rule of Law in Naxal-affected areas and the second was to develop such areas,� the minister said. Shah said a �strong, ruthless strategy is required for launching last assault against Naxals�. Declaring that the last fight with Maoists is near, Shah declared 24 August 2024 that the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government \"will free India from Naxal violence by March 2026�. | | | --- | | **NEWS****LETTER** | | **Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list** | | **Enter Your Email Address** | Do Not Sell My Personal Information [Advertise with Us](https://www.globalsecurity.org/org/advertise.htm) \\| [About Us](https://www.globalsecurity.org/org/index.html) \\| [Site Map](https://www.globalsecurity.org/sitemap.htm) \\| [Privacy](https://www.globalsecurity.org/privacy.htm)",

    "full_text": "Since its independence in 1947, India has fought dozens of campaigns against four distinct and independent insurgencies on its soil—in Punjab, Kashmir, the Northeast, and the Maoist insurgents of central India—as well as one foreign campaign in Sri Lanka. While India has accumulated a wealth of counterinsurgency (COIN) experience that has varied in terms of terrain, insurgent goals, force structure(s), foreign involvement, and outcomes, most COIN scholars have focused on Western foreign incumbent experiences to the neglect of India and other indigenous incumbents.[1] Nevertheless, as both Iraq and Afghanistan move toward assuming greater responsibility for their internal security amidst continued insurgent activity, India’s COIN strategies can offer important lessons for these states and others that resemble its highly federalized political system, developing economy, and still evolving democracy. One analyst has argued that India has “one of the world’s most successful records in fighting insurgencies,” noting that “it has not yet lost a counterinsurgency campaign within the country.”[2] This claim, however, is puzzling given the current struggles of the Indian government to curb a raging Maoist insurgency. Today, while the insurgencies of the Northeast and Kashmir are largely contained, if not under control, and the Punjab insurgency soundly defeated, India has been earnestly testing different COIN strategies to combat a growing Maoist threat throughout its center and east known generally as the Naxalite insurgency. Since resurging in the last decade, the Naxalite uprising has been described by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as “a great national security threat” and the “biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”[3] This article will briefly describe some of the lessons of success and failure that can be drawn from India’s decades of COIN experience and their application in the current fight against the Naxalite insurgency. India’s Alternative Approach to COIN Generally speaking, the Indian take on COIN appears to depart from the approach advocated by Western doctrine that promotes a population-centric strategy to win “hearts and minds.”[4] Despite Indian official doctrine formally espousing this concept[5] and some contentions that India has always seen COIN as a “political rather than military problem,”[6] a closer look reveals that the Indian approach may be better characterized as a strategy of attrition[7] with the deployment of “raw state coercion”[8] and “enemy-centric” campaigns[9] to suffocate an insurgency through a “saturation of forces.”[10] At times it may involve the co-optation of elites to “buy-out” and contain an insurgency.[11] When the military has been deployed, it operates under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which includes “the power of the security forces to make preventative arrests, search premises without warrant, and shoot and kill civilians.”[12] In each major counterinsurgency campaign, the Indian state developed a number of innovative tactics and organizational capacities that yielded some success along with some negative fallout. During the Punjab campaign, India militarized the police and reversed their role with the military to harness local knowledge and legitimacy and lead kinetic operations.[13] As a result, the police structure remained highly militarized, bloated, inefficient, and incapable of investigative police work more than a decade later.[14] In Kashmir, the creation of a dedicated COIN force—the Rashtriya Rifles, integrating an army ethos into a paramilitary force especially equipped and trained to conduct counterinsurgency—achieved some success, but it ultimately had to be fully manned by army personnel and faced a number of operational and coordination problems with other forces.[15] The co-optation and transformation of insurgents into local assets was a tactic employed both in Punjab (called “CATs,” for Covert Apprehension Technique) and Kashmir (ikhwanis).[16] Turning insurgents was sometimes achieved through money[17] as well as abduction and torture,[18] but these tactics eventually led to new problems, such as increased criminal activity and corrupted security forces, for the respective governments.[19] Moreover, the highly kinetic approach of both campaigns entailed tremendous brutality, torture, disappearances, “encounter killings,” and mass graves that created a litany of human rights investigations and public disaffection, and today continues to fuel simmering resentment and potentially violence.[20] A slight variant of this approach—the buyout and political incorporation of insurgents—has enabled India to keep a lid on a whole host of insurgent separatist movements in the seven states of India’s eastern extremity, India’s Northeast, since 1956.[21] Yet while eliminating the prospect of separatism, it has perversely created spirals of insecurity, splinter groups (there are more than 100 distinct armed groups in the Northeast), and a dysfunctional insurgent political economy of violence, development aid, and interminable militia politics.[22] Overall, the Indian strategy of coercion, co-optation, and containment has achieved moderate success in mitigating the threat to the state, and this is being applied today against the re-emergent Naxalite insurgency. The Naxalite Insurgency The Naxalites first emerged in 1967 in the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal and spread throughout the central states of Bihar, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh until it was violently suppressed by state and paramilitary forces by 1972. This militant left-wing movement fractured into more than 40 distinct groups, which began to remobilize, consolidate and become more active in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly in the state of Andhra Pradesh.[23] Since 2004, with the merger of the two largest factions—the Peoples War Group and the Maoist Communist Center—to form the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-M), violence has climbed dramatically, with 2,200 incidents and 1,200 killed in 2010 alone.[24] It is estimated that Naxals have a presence in one-third of districts in India,[25] but with the strongest foothold in parts of seven states—West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The difference today is that this region also happens to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric potential.[26] While some parts of the left-wing movement in India are willing to partly or fully embrace parliamentary politics to address issues of class, inequality, and distribution, the hardcore Naxalites remain unwilling to countenance democratic politics and seek the violent overthrow of the state through a variety of tactics.[27] Although conventional accounts describe them as motivated by the broad economic deprivation and absence of the state in much of rural central India,[28] a more specific reason is resentment at the local exploitative power configurations—whether feudal landlords, land-expropriating state governments, or extractive corporations—that continue to dominate and suppress the lower castes and aboriginal tribes that reside in these areas and constitute the Naxalite support base.[29] The Naxalites, however, are a protean movement that has expertly exploited a variety of caste, ethnic, or sectarian cleavages in India.[30] Unlike some of the ethno-sectarian insurgencies of recent years, the Naxalite insurgency—posturing itself as a “people’s war”—comports more with classic COIN theory that was built on notions of competitive state building to address economic and governance deficiencies.[31] In step with their historical experience, however, the Indian state has generally favored a more kinetic approach to counterinsurgency over winning “hearts and minds.”[32] There appears to be an explicit awareness that the Western COIN model may not be the right fit for India. One Indian military analyst and practitioner praised the Andhra Pradesh approach for its “enemy-centric” character, an anathema in current Western COIN discourse.[33] Another well-regarded Indian analyst defended a kinetic focus and derided the hearts and minds “myth” by recalling that even Sir Gerald Templar regarded it as “that nauseating phrase I think I invented.”[34] Moreover, a well-known defense journalist wrote that a population-centric approach “has proved to be flawed.”[35] Indian State Response to the Naxalites State Strategies Given India’s federalist structure, the onus for responding to the rising Naxalite threat has fallen upon individual states, although with substantial federal support during the past five years.[36] The hardest hit states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh—where roughly half of Naxalite activity is concentrated and continues to escalate—have raced to scale up the manpower of their state and local police forces, while being supplemented with about 40 battalions of central paramilitary forces.[37] Meanwhile, states such as Bihar and West Bengal have also seen a rise in violence in recent years as their police manpower has declined or held steady. The composition of police is another variable that may adversely affect outcomes. The police forces of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Orissa are composed of a much higher percentage of paramilitary forces (as opposed to civil police) relative to the Indian average, potentially rendering them less locally knowledgeable or legitimate.[38] Central and state governments have been criticized for their paramilitary forces’ shortfalls in size, antiquated organizational structure and age profile, inadequate training (for instance, only firing 20 rounds per year), and most importantly the absence of coordination or a coherent strategy.[39] The Limits of Indian Responses True to its past history, the Indian central and state governments’ COIN responses have been heavily kinetic, disregarding local public perceptions. One Indian commentator wrote, “exceeding Maoist rebels they accuse of brutality, the police, paramilitary and Salwa Judum recruits continue to freely kill unarmed men and women. It has wrecked any short- to medium-term hope of winning tribals and forest dwellers back to the fold of the state.”[40] With the launch of additional major sweep operations and expansion of commando units, collateral damage of civilians caught in the crossfire and through retribution is expected to rise.[41] Violence, whether premeditated or spontaneous, “can be completely indiscriminate, leading to the burning of the homes of innocents and their torture, maiming, rape, and death.”[42] While there have been centralized efforts to coordinate the use of force and economic development, these have largely faltered due to poor coordination, misutilization, and co-optation by local elites and corporations.[43] The Indian government has repeatedly set up unified commands to better coordinate the use of central paramilitary forces, state armed (paramilitary) police, and state local or civil police, but these have been riddled with problems and at times hindered local innovation.[44] A major attempt was launched with Operation Green Hunt in late 2009, a massive search-and-destroy operation meant to clear out the Naxalite strongholds in the forests of central India. The fissures of this unified command, however, were exposed when a company of central paramilitary forces short on local police support and intelligence were ambushed and more than 80 killed after being tracked for three days by Naxalite insurgents.[45] The two states that appear to be relatively successful at reducing insurgent activity or keeping it at bay are Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra seems to have had a relatively higher police to population ratio at the beginning of the decade, potentially buffering it from the spillover of Naxalite insurgency from neighboring areas. While Andhra Pradesh’s manpower ratio rose somewhat over the past decade, its success in dramatically reducing Naxalite activity in its territory is generally attributed by Indian analysts to a rather different strategy of raising a special commando force known as the Greyhounds.[46] The Greyhound Force The Greyhound force, an elite anti-Maoist commando unit, was raised beginning in 1987 from within the Andhra Pradesh police to conduct small unit counterguerrilla offensives against Naxalite insurgents.[47] Roundly believed to have been tremendously successful, the Andhra Pradesh police have drawn inspiration from the infamous Selous Scouts of Rhodesia to prosecute the equivalent of a “bush war” against the Naxalites.[48] The 2,000-strong Greyhound force is better paid and equipped than federal or state paramilitary forces with state of the art weapons and technology, better trained in jungle warfare, and moves in nimbler, highly capable units to target, track, and destroy insurgent networks by modeling guerrilla tactics.[49] The Greyhounds are also well supported by the entire state police force.[50] Two companies of Greyhounds would be deployed at a joint operational base with two platoons of local home guards for intelligence and logistical support.[51] Between 2005 and 2008, they have been credited with bringing down the Maoist cadre in Andhra Pradesh from 1,200 to 500 and Naxalite activity in the state this decade has dropped from a peak of roughly 600 attacks in 2003 to around 100 in 2010.[52] Their success was attributed to signals intelligence exploitation, careful operational planning, jungle survival training, night operations, and decapitation of Maoist leadership.[53] The Greyhound model is perceived to be so successful that many states are starting to develop their own small unit commando police battalions. While the Indian central government continues to pour central paramilitary forces into the region (now on the order of about 70 battalions), it is also raising 10 Commando Battalions for Resolute Action (CoBRA) and deploying them alongside state and federal units.[54] Yet one should be leery of the triumphant claims made of Andhra Pradesh as well as the potential to model the Greyhound success. First, there is reason to believe that the Greyhounds did not defeat the Maoist insurgents outright but merely displaced them to neighboring states. This corresponds with data that shows Naxalite activity skyrocketed in neighboring Chhattisgarh as it declined in Andhra Pradesh.[55] Second, intelligence officers and other analysts believe gains in Andhra Pradesh are unsustainable and the state remains highly vulnerable to Maoist activity.[56] This fear was validated by a recent Times of India-IMMRB survey of five northern districts of Andhra Pradesh recently cleared of Maoist insurgents where the majority of those surveyed still sympathized with Naxalite motives, methods, and results, and viewed actions by state forces such as encounter killings as suspect and unjustified. Meanwhile, a plurality believed nothing had improved and exploitation had increased since their departure.[57] Even if the Naxalite presence and violence has been structurally reduced, the survey revealed that the strategy has certainly not relied upon winning hearts and minds to achieve this end. Finally, even if the Greyhound approach was actually successful, the background conditions required to achieve operational effectiveness are currently absent or underdeveloped in the rest of the country. Andhra Pradesh began raising the Greyhounds in 1987 but did not achieve marked success until almost two decades later. Despite the state having a relatively efficient policing system, both the Greyhound commandos and the state police and security force serving as the logistical and intelligence “tail” took substantial time to mature.[58] New police inductees served first in the Greyhound support unit for about four years before rotating to the district level where they might continue to support operations.[59] This gradually built up inter-organizational familiarity and cooperation within the state, and the substantial network of well-trained local police—features noticeably absent in the rest of Naxal-affected India—were able to funnel high quality intelligence for Greyhound targeting.[60] Conclusion Three points are worth noting about Indian counterinsurgency strategy. First, rather than abiding by a singular formula, strategies have varied over time and space depending on the context and nature of the insurgency. Second, India has routinely departed from the traditional “hearts and minds” or population-centric COIN for a highly kinetic and coercive enemy-centric COIN. Third, Indian successes are never “clean” and always involve uncomfortable tradeoffs, whether by way of criminal activity, organizational dysfunction and corruption, or further insurgency. These should all be expected as India faces down the Naxalite insurgency over what might be a full decade or more.[61] This third point is in part related to India’s democratic character. The mobilization capacity of insurgents creates perverse interests by political parties to harness these assets for their own ends.[62] In fact, for much of the earlier part of this decade, most Naxal-affected states “abdicated their authority over vast regions, as long as the semblance of normalcy could be maintained and the electoral interests of the dominant political party could be taken care of.”[63] Moreover, Indian counterinsurgency has been and will likely continue to look both brutal and incomplete (by Western standards) because the incumbent is unwilling to countenance the types of institutional overhauls needed to fully quell insurgent impulses. If the fundamental conflict is not over the distribution of resources that can be mended with economic development, but rather the distribution of power controlled by the state and elite cadres, then the disease is the system.[64] The cure then may deeply threaten not only India’s growth engine that has relied upon land appropriation and displacement for industrialization and mining, but also the power, composition, and identity of the Indian state stretching from the local level up to the state and national governments.

Achuthan, “Tackling Maoists: The Andhra Paradigm,” Indian Defence Review 25:2 (2010). [27] Naxalite insurgents have targeted “class enemies” (sometimes through beheadings), police and security forces, infrastructure such as police stations, schools, local government buildings, roads, power lines, railways, and economic targets like mining and energy infrastructure. They have been able to carry out these activities through the acquisition as well as indigenous production of a wide variety of weapons including automatic firearms, rocket launchers, and a whole host of mines for which they use to conduct IED attacks and small unit ambushes. See Ramana; Achuthan; Sudeep Chakravarti, “No End in Sight,” Seminar 605 (2010). The Naxalites are also reported to provide public goods to local residents such as security, swift justice in “people’s courts,” education, irrigation, community kitchens, medical units, and minimum wage enforcement in part through extortion and taxation of local government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.

    "full_text": "Even as India and China find themselves **[embroiled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/world/asia/india-china-border.html)** in yet another border standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), **[commentators](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/pakistan-factor-india-china-standoff-161021)** have sounded alarm on how Pakistan could seek to utilize the situation. Concurrently, **[some have observed](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/09/china-india-border-united-states-pakistan/)** that China’s transgression at the border is likely to push New Delhi closer to Washington, at a time when Sino-U.S. tensions are running high. A dyadic understanding of the security environment in Southern Asia, either through an India-Pakistan or India-China lens, is thus incomplete and does not account for the triangular dynamics that shape these interactions. To understand regional dynamics, it is critical to understand the India-Pakistan-China triangle and how it is impacted by the strategic chain, including the United States. The contemporary reality of these dynamics is grounded in an early Cold War history, and potential conflict scenarios involving these countries animate the geopolitics of Southern Asia. **A Triangle Made in History** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is mired in a convoluted history of unresolved border disputes, with military confrontations between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and India and Pakistan at the Line of Control (LoC) occurring intermittently. In 1947, Britain’s hasty withdrawal from the subcontinent as a result of post-war decolonization led to a haphazard redrawing of political boundaries in Southern Asia, leaving some territory contested. The four wars that India and Pakistan have fought since 1947, the Sino-Indian Border War of 1962, and recurrent India-China and India-Pakistan conflicts at the LAC and LoC trace their genesis back to this protracted history. The military dimension of this triangle evolved in the years after the 1962 Sino-Indian Border War, when Beijing and Islamabad signed the **[border delimitation agreement in 1963](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXzxLcF92cEC&pg=PA210&dq=China-Pakistan+border+delimitation+agreement+estranged+democracies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDydvUnNjpAhWCfH0KHQmRDKUQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=China-Pakistan%20border%20delimitation%20agreement%20estranged%20democracies&f=false)**. As part of this agreement, Pakistan handed over the Trans-Karakoram tract, a territory in Kashmir that India claimed, to China, turning the dispute into **[a trilateral one](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357716408444182?journalCode=caji19)**. Further, during the **[1965 India-Pakistan War](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DXY8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false),** Pakistan felt betrayed by a lack of U.S. support, and chose to strengthen relations with China. Pakistan **[had expected](https://www.amazon.com/Wages-Globalism-Lyndon-Johnson-American/dp/0195113772)** the United States to tilt to its side, due to the 1954 U.S.-Pakistan mutual defense agreement and Pakistan’s membership in U.S. engineered alliances like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization. However, during and after the 1962 war, the United States showed hitherto unseen willingness to aid and assist India’s military against Communist China, **[making it prudent](https://www.amazon.in/JFKs-Forgotten-Crisis-Tibet-Sino-Indian/dp/935177788X)** for China and Pakistan to join hands. Although Washington premised arming both Pakistan and India to achieve its Cold War objective to contain communism in Asia, neither side bought Washington’s assurances that its military supplies were not meant to be used against each other. Although China did not provide any direct military help to its new friend Pakistan during the 1965 war, it did engage in a **[psychological assault](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zcylFXH9_z8C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)** against India, repeatedly accusing New Delhi of showing aggression on the India-China border, and threatening Chinese reprisal. During and after the 1971 India-Pakistan War, the United States tilted towards Pakistan, because it needed Islamabad as a conduit to Beijing during the 1972 Sino-U.S. rapprochement talks. Beginning in 1979, Pakistan played a frontline role for the United States in Afghanistan, in the last Cold War tussle between the United States and Soviet Union. In this context, **[geopolitics trumped nonproliferation concerns](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Live-Bomb-Pakistan-1998-2016/dp/0199404569)** as Washington ignored intelligence that China was helping Pakistan develop a nuclear bomb. These conditions were hardly conducive for a healthy Indo-U.S. relationship, despite efforts at finding convergent points during the Reagan presidency. After the Cold War, the subsequent rise of China as a global power, followed by that of India, shifted dynamics of the India-China dyad, leading to heightened Sino-Indian competition, and tightening Sino-Pakistan military ties. Meanwhile, the India-Pakistan relationship remained volatile, taking an even more sinister turn as **[cross-border terrorism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413952?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)** emanating in Pakistan targeted India, becoming a lingering roadblock to normalizing ties. **The Triangle in Contemporary Times** What characterizes this triangle is the geographical proximity of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. Today, both **[capabilities and intentions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2538540?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)** play a significant role in shaping **[perceptions and misperceptions](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Perception_and_Misperception_in_Internat.html?id=qqAIuHgi2hoC&redir_esc=y)** within the India-Pakistan-China triangle. Specifically, Pakistan’s power asymmetry relative to that of India, and India’s power gap vis-à-vis China drive each state’s regional posture. Pakistan’s bid to enhance its capabilities, especially through nuclear deterrence and **[with Chinese assistance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01495933.2013.821850)**, is a means to counter India’s conventional superiority. Meanwhile, China’s growing military capabilities and defense modernization as well as **[its increasing role](https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/growing-chinese-influence-south-asia)** as a development and security partner for not only Pakistan but also a host of other states in India’s neighborhood foment concern in New Delhi. Additionally, what characterizes this triangle is also the **[geographical proximity](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=02XxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=India-China-Pakistan+nuclear+deterrence+and+geographical+proximity&source=bl&ots=Q4wFzhRuUe&sig=ACfU3U2oCZjw3dBhPI8LJeByW_pisUDVmw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwig59mAltjpAhVEgOYKHVz1CO4Q6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=India-China-Pakistan%20nuclear%20deterrence%20and%20geographical%20proximity&f=false)** of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. However, the Pakistani response to any India-China border confrontation, and a Chinese response to an India-Pakistan war or a military standoff at the borders, is **[more tacit than overt](https://theasiadialogue.com/2017/10/19/the-india-china-pakistan-triangle-strategic-ebbs-and-flows/)**, since the China-Pakistan strategic alliance does not have any unambiguous notion of the two countries coming to each other’s help in the event of a war. **More than a Triangle: The Strategic Chain** Strategic analysts **[increasingly agree](https://carnegieendowment.org/2013/08/05/strategic-triangle-pub-52584)** that the security dynamics of Southern Asia are best explained as a triangle, rather than as an India-Pakistan dyad. However, external players are crucial in shaping outcomes within this triangle, and so regional dynamics may be better depicted as a **[strategic chain](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/acnpi_201703_strategic_chain.pdf)** wherein the United States is the most prominent external agent of influence. The triangle and the strategic chain, as conceptual lenses to understand geopolitics in Southern Asia, are complementary rather than contradictory. While the **[inherent security dilemma](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/acnpi_201703_strategic_chain.pdf)** in the India-Pakistan-China triangle continues to be a major determining factor of the regional security scenario, looking at how the U.S. role complicates responses and counter-responses in this triangle, completes the picture. The emerging security environment in the region can be better explained by considering the concerns regarding China’s rise that drive the Indo-U.S. relationship, China and Pakistan’s threat perceptions vis-à-vis this partnership, and India’s worries emanating from the China-Pakistan alliance. As Chinese influence increases in India’s maritime and continental neighborhood, New Delhi has in turn **[reached out](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/india-act-east-policy-is-becoming-act-indo-pacific/389502/)** to China’s neighbors to build partnerships with countries in Southeast and East Asia. Rising Sino-Indian competition in both continental and maritime realms, along with the global power tussle between China and the United States, has led to a **[greater strategic embrace](https://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/32421/Joint_Statement_Vision_and_Principles_for_IndiaUS_Comprehensive_Global_Strategic_Partnership)** between New Delhi and Washington. Beijing, on the one hand, **[tries to convince](https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-india/)** New Delhi not to fully align with the United States against China, engaging India in a number of forums such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, Russia, South Africa (BRICS), Russia-India-China (RIC), Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and through bilateral top leadership **[summits](https://jamestown.org/program/india-china-relations-from-the-wuhan-spirit-to-the-chennai-connect/).** On the other hand, Beijing solidifies its strategic outreach to Pakistan, which inherently isolates India, through **[controversial projects](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/inclusion-of-cpec-under-obor-shows-lack-of-appreciation-of-india-s-concerns-on-sovereignty-119062601263_1.html)** like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The interlocking threat perceptions and responses in the triangle hence cannot be decoupled from the U.S. strategy in the region, making the strategic chain an effective complement to explain the geopolitics of Southern Asia. **Conflict Scenarios** The regional postures of China, India, and Pakistan and the U.S. strategy in Southern Asia intend to maximize interest by capability enhancement, either through internal or external balancing. This makes the security dilemma in the region more acute and creates the possibility of conflict, some scenarios of which are explored below. _Two-front war_ Since India’s border disputes with China and Pakistan are still unresolved and Beijing and Islamabad have a close strategic and military partnership, India perceives any conflagration with either Pakistan or China as raising the specter of a two-front war. The Indian military establishment is overt in asserting its recognition of and readiness to face such an eventuality. For example, General Bipin Rawat, currently India’s Chief of Defense Staff, while serving as the Indian Army Chief, **[commented](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-front-war-is-a-real-scenario-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/56324336.cms)**, “The two-front is a real scenario. Much has changed from before in terms of our capabilities…The Army, Navy and IAF are now jointly very much prepared for such an eventuality.” India’s military preparedness for a two-front war involves developing its overall deterrent capability and credibility, advances in terms of acquisition and production of military equipment, recalibrating its military strategy, relevant training efforts to meet exigencies, and border infrastructure development. Infrastructure building in the border areas and the issue of terrain advantage has been a [**major source of contention**](https://theprint.in/opinion/china-believes-india-wants-aksai-chin-back-thats-why-it-has-crossed-lac-in-ladakh/430899/), particularly, as seen in the current clashes between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh, or in the earlier Doklam standoff. While the Indian military establishment understandably **[projects its readiness](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-front-war-is-a-real-scenario-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/56324336.cms?from=mdr)**, others **[are more skeptical](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-sobering-arithmetic-of-a-two-front-war/)**. The case of Pakistan taking the opportunity of an India-China conflict and opening a second front at the LoC **[is seen as most probable](https://theprint.in/opinion/india-has-a-bigger-worry-than-lac-china-now-expanding-military-footprint-in-indian-ocean/439934/)**. Other scenarios include China opening a second front at the LAC or in the **[Indian Ocean region](https://theprint.in/opinion/india-has-a-bigger-worry-than-lac-china-now-expanding-military-footprint-in-indian-ocean/439934/)** in the event of an India-Pakistan conflict, or a more sinister case of a pre-planned China-Pakistan military assault against India. Indian Army Chief M M Naravane said earlier this year, “\\[…\\]Though it can take place at any level, Siachen and Shaksgam Valley are the places where territory of these two countries meet. Threat of collusivity is maximum in the strategically important glacier which forces us to keep our possession.” Talking about identifying a primary and secondary front in such a scenario, **[he added](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/01/11/how-will-india-handle-a-two-front-war-army-chief-general-naravane-explains.html)**, “For years, we have been focusing on western border on the basis of threats. Now, we have to rebalance our deployment towards northern sector.” Irrespective of how probable such a scenario is, the perception of such a threat is likely to dictate both the reality and signalling of India’s military preparedness. _Friction in the Strategic Chain_ The India-Pakistan-China triangle is determined by relative national power and mutual threat perceptions, further complicated by the regional implications of the growing confrontation between the United States and China. Pakistan remains the most steadfast ally of China in India’s neighborhood, while India remains the only country in the region that comes closest to competing with growing Chinese influence. Stress in the strategic chain may act as a contributing factor to conflict in the region. The potential for the India-China-Pakistan-United States strategic chain to complicate matters in Southern Asia can be seen in the case of India’s candidacy for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership. **[Washington supports](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/donald-trump-administration-urges-nsg-members-to-support-indias-application/articleshow/59796299.cms?from=mdr)** India’s bid while the **[Chinese oppose it](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-says-no-change-in-its-stand-on-indias-membership-to-nsg/articleshow/61964228.cms?from=mdr)**, citing India’s refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and equating India’s candidature to that of Pakistan. Moreover, Beijing **[has been resistant](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/why-china-changed-its-stand-on-masood-azhar/article27211058.ece)** to supporting international efforts to list Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the United Nations Security Council, and **[withdrew](https://www.axios.com/china-backs-terror-designation-for-masood-azhar-in-win-for-india-8af16a49-d93e-4632-a5c2-060f0831ee00.html)** their technical hold only last year. Additionally, Afghan security in the midst of American withdrawal is another issue impacting this strategic chain: China’s **[politico-economic role in Afghanistan](https://warontherocks.com/2020/04/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-afghanistan/)** passes through Pakistan. Islamabad has **[been instrumental in bringing](https://www.ft.com/content/66b0906a-993d-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d)** the Chinese establishment closer to the Taliban, as China hopes to checkmate links between Uighur separatists in Xinjiang Province and militants in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Such developments are significant from New Delhi’s view, as it needs to become **[more pragmatic](https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/does-india-have-a-new-playbook-for-a-new-afghanistan/)** to deal with all forces that are central to the future of Afghanistan. This should include talking to the Taliban, to secure its interest in Afghanistan, in the event of an American withdrawal, the return of the Taliban as a political force and Pakistan’s intention to undercut Indian influence. These frictions in the strategic chain exacerbate the inherent tensions in the India-Pakistan-China triad, making differences more intractable and protracted. **Conclusion** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is determined by relative national power and mutual threat perceptions, further complicated by the regional implications of the growing confrontation between the United States and China. Pakistan remains the most steadfast ally of China in India’s neighborhood, while India remains the only country in the region that comes closest to competing with growing Chinese influence. The power asymmetry between India and Pakistan in the former’s favor, and the **[growing power imbalance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-china-ladakh-lac-border-dispute-c-raja-mohan-6449294/)** between India and China in the latter’s favor will continue to reinforce the inherent security dilemma of the triangle, justifying China-Pakistan collusion, in order to checkmate India’s rise in the region. Moreover, Chinese perceptions of a U.S. containment strategy that involves India additionally impacts the triangle. The broad mistrust and zero-sum perceptions in the triangle will continue to determine the probability of crises and conflict playing out at the LAC and LoC. Besides the more volatile responses and counter-responses over the disputed borders, differences will simmer at global forums over issues such as counterterrorism and nonproliferation, and over the regional security situation in Afghanistan. Despite attempts at diplomatic maneuvers and confidence building measures to arrest uncontrolled escalation and inadvertent conflict in the triangle, the complex dynamics of the India-Pakistan-China triangle, further reinforced by the role of the United States in the region, make conflict a regular phenomenon that has to be managed, rather than eliminated.

Picture source: Depositphotos. _Prospects & Perspectives No. 28_ **The Shadow War: How the Pahalgam Terror Attack Redefined India-China-Pakistan Equation** By _Jagannath Panda_ The Pahalgam [terror attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl) of April 2025, executed by the Pakistan-backed group [The Resistance Front](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473) (TRF), was not merely another episode in the long-running saga of India-Pakistan hostility. It was a warning flare in a broader, more complex geopolitical theatre that now unmistakably includes China. By and large, India’s reaction was strong, swift, and assertive beyond the border against the terrorist outfits harbored in Pakistan. The launch of [Operation Sindoor](https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/39473), a precise military response targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), marked a defining evolution in India’s deterrence doctrine, pointing to a zero-tolerance strategy against terrorism. More than a tactical strike, it was a message — India will respond with resolve, not restraint, when its civilians are attacked. The operation drew clear parallels with the Balakot airstrikes of 2019, yet the context had shifted. The regional climate in 2025 is far more combustible, with trilateral tensions simmering in the Himalayas. The Pahalgam incident has exposed deep-seated fractures in the regional power matrix. China’s strategic posture in the aftermath — marked by conspicuous silence, selective language, and diplomatic hedging — underscores a growing contradiction between its self-styled image as a responsible global power and its operational behavior in South Asia. By refusing to acknowledge the terrorist dimension of such attacks or to pressure its close partner, Pakistan, Beijing reveals a troubling unwillingness to act as a genuine stabilizing force in the region. The contradictions in its stand are only growing and becoming more transparent to the world by the day. Is China truly committed to regional peace and stability, or is it bound by time-worn strategic alignments that prioritize geopolitical advantage over normative responsibility? Can a power that positions itself as an architect of global order afford to undermine its credibility by shielding a state associated with cross-border terrorism? What should be India’s strategic response to this shadow war? **Beijing’s Balancing Act: Neutrality or Strategic Collusion?** Following India’s retaliation, the world watched closely for diplomatic fallout. China’s response was a masterclass in studied ambiguity. Beijing termed India’s military action “ [regrettable](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/fyrbt/202505/t20250507_11616523.html)” while conspicuously omitting any condemnation of the terror attack itself. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made [no mention](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/lxjzh/202505/t20250509_11618305.html) of the victims in Pahalgam, nor TRF’s Pakistani connections. Instead, Beijing’s focus remained firmly on urging “restraint” and “dialogue,” echoing a playbook that has often shielded Islamabad from international censure. This is not entirely a new behavior on the part of the Chinese leadership. Beijing has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the UN Security Council to [block designations of known terrorists](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-china-at-un-for-blocking-move-to-designate-2611-accused-sajid-mir-as-global-terrorist/article66993043.ece) based in Pakistan, including Sajid Mir, a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander involved in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008. This pattern of diplomatic protection underscores China’s strategic calculus: Pakistan is more than an ally — it is a linchpin in Beijing’s South Asia strategy and a buffer against Indian regional ascendency. What makes China’s stance especially problematic is its persistent refusal to differentiate between India’s counterterrorism actions and aggressive behavior. Chinese state media and official discourse frequently conflate Indian responses along the LoC with assertive conduct along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), crafting a narrative in which India is portrayed as a regional aggressor. This distortion allows Beijing to simultaneously align with Pakistan’s security outlook while maintaining a superficial neutrality. Moreover, China’s behavior mirrors its broader geopolitical approach: internal threats such as “Uyghur separatism” are met with uncompromising state violence, while external threats that affect neighbors like India are compartmentalized or ignored. The selective outrage is a window into Beijing’s dual standards on terrorism and state sovereignty. **Proxy Wars and Silent Partners: Redrawing the Diplomatic Map** Beyond the rhetoric, Beijing’s alignment with Pakistan is rooted in hard interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This infrastructure project is not just about roads and pipelines — it’s about strategic depth. Any Indian challenge to the territorial status quo threatens both Pakistan’s and China’s investments, thereby sealing the logic of Beijing’s indirect complicity. This complicity extends into the diplomatic arena. In multilateral forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China has consistently [blocked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-rights-must-be-respected-india-after-skipping-xinjiang-vote/articleshow/94713915.cms) Indian attempts to highlight Pakistan’s role in sponsoring cross-border terrorism. Instead, China promotes counterterrorism frameworks that align neatly with its own domestic narratives, especially those concerning Xinjiang, while conveniently avoiding issues that implicate Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its [strategic silence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/22/asia/imran-khan-xinjiang-axios-intl-hnk) on China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, despite its self-styled image as a champion of the Islamic world. This tacit exchange of blind spots — on terrorism and human rights — has become the bedrock of the Sino-Pakistani axis. And India, despite walking a tightrope on sensitive Chinese issues like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, has received no reciprocation in the form of diplomatic neutrality or support. The geopolitical geometry is clear: while India and Pakistan battle over borders and ideology, China plays the dual role of facilitator and firewall for Islamabad. Whether in backchannel diplomacy or in global institutions, China consistently acts to dilute pressure on Pakistan, reinforcing a strategic triangle that disadvantages New Delhi at every turn. Beijing’s deliberate omission of Pakistani provocations and cross-border violence in its Operation Sindoor response press briefings suggests a calculated strategic posture. This silence reflects China’s continued alignment with Pakistan, indicating that broader geopolitical considerations outweigh any immediate concerns about regional instability. By not publicly addressing Islamabad’s role, China signals its intent to preserve and prioritize its long-standing strategic partnership with Pakistan. **A Call for India’s Strategic Realignment** In this increasingly tangled web of interests, India must reassess its China doctrine. The idea of Beijing as a potential stabilizer in South Asia has little basis in reality. Instead, China has shown a consistent willingness to prioritize its strategic partnerships and investments over regional peace or normative alignment against terrorism. One avenue for India is to adopt a strategy of normative reciprocity. If China insists on referring to Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory,” India could begin more openly addressing Chinese sensitive issues, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and potentially even Taiwan, revisiting its “One China” policy. Until now, India has largely upheld a principle of “mutual sensitivity” regarding core sovereignty concerns. While China has been increasingly assertive in internationalizing the Kashmir issue — whether through UN Security Council interventions, statements aligning with Pakistan, or selective cartographic provocations — India has avoided reciprocal commentary on China’s sensitive regions. This asymmetric restraint has allowed China to shape narratives unchallenged, while denying India the same deference on issues central to its national unity. Engaging Taiwan more openly — especially on trade, technology, and democratic solidarity — aligns India with other democracies like the U.S., Japan, and parts of Europe that have gradually normalized unofficial ties. Strengthening ties with Taiwan also offers India access to high-end manufacturing, especially in semiconductors, where Taiwan’s TSMC dominates global supply chains, critical for India’s tech and defense sectors. A closer India-Taiwan dynamic could be used as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance Chinese assertiveness in the region, especially when coupled with defense dialogues like the Quad. Explicit moves on Taiwan would likely provoke strong diplomatic and possibly economic retaliation from Beijing. This could take the form of border pressure along the LAC, trade restrictions, or cyber disruptions. Any move on Taiwan would have more impact if coordinated with partners like the U.S., Japan, or Australia. A unilateral shift may yield limited strategic gain while exposing India to disproportionate costs. It is therefore imperative that India must continue to invest more robustly in multilateral and minilateral coalitions that exclude or counterbalance China, such as the Quad, the India-Japan-Australia trilateral, and enhanced EU engagements. India’s aspiration to be recognized as a major international power, including in the “Global South,” depends not solely on its material capabilities but also on its normative influence, particularly in shaping global discourses on terrorism. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, New Delhi may need to recalibrate its approach by intensifying collaboration with global norm entrepreneurs, including middle powers across Europe and Asia, as well as transnational civil society and multilateral institutions. Moreover, India’s leadership roles in forums such as the G20 and BRICS present strategic platforms through which it can reframe regional security narratives and assert its vision for counterterrorism norms. Domestically, India must prepare for the long haul. The possibility of a coordinated two-front scenario — with Pakistan engaging in asymmetric warfare through proxy actors and irregular tactics and China providing strategic and diplomatic cover — is no longer hypothetical. Preparing for this evolving threat environment requires India to adopt a comprehensive and long-term security posture, encompassing military modernization, institutional resilience, and societal preparedness. Enhancing border infrastructure, upgrading intelligence and surveillance capabilities, and fortifying strategic deterrence must be non-negotiables in India’s defense roadmap. Sustaining a prolonged state of readiness requires a resilient defense-industrial base, robust supply chains, and financial planning. India must continue reforms to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, incentivize indigenous R&D, and create strategic reserves for critical materials. Further, building robust logistical networks, especially in border states and high-altitude regions, will improve troop mobility and sustain long-term deployments. Civil-military synergy in infrastructure projects such as roads, airfields, and telecommunications along both western and eastern frontiers is essential. The shifting threat landscape demands that India move beyond reactive postures. Both Pakistan and China are adept at leveraging information warfare and disinformation to influence public opinion and sow discord. India must invest in counter-disinformation capacities, strategic communication, and public awareness campaigns to build regional and societal resilience against foreign psychological operations, where Taiwan could emerge as a stronger partner. New Delhi must significantly enhance its capabilities in narrative warfare — a strategic effort to shape perceptions, control the discourse, and influence international opinion. This involves not only countering adversarial narratives but also proactively framing its own story in a manner that resonates with global audiences. India’s case against Pakistan-based terrorism, as well as China’s tacit support through diplomatic silence or selective framing, must be articulated with clarity, credibility, and moral authority. To be effective, this narrative must be disseminated across multiple global platforms — from the United Nations and international media to think tanks, academic forums, and digital diplomacy channels — to expose the regional destabilizing roles of both Pakistan and China, and to align international sentiment with India’s security concerns and normative positions. The decision to send [delegations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seven-all-party-delegations-to-take-indias-message-against-terrorism-to-key-partner-nations-government/article69586448.ece) to 32 nations is a strong first step. Publishing credible evidence, such as satellite imagery, financial trail disclosures, or intercepted communications, can further strengthen the factual basis of India’s narrative and pre-empt counterclaims. **Conclusion: Pahalgam as a Turning Point** The Pahalgam terrorist attack will be remembered not just for its human toll, but for what it revealed about the shifting tectonics of regional power complexities. It was a moment of clarity: India is not just facing a belligerent neighbor in Pakistan, but also contending with a cunning and double-standard power in China that is willing to obscure terrorism behind the veil of strategic self-interest. Increasingly, China’s actions — or calculated inactions — are rendering its strategic contradictions more visible to the international community, challenging the coherence of its South Asia policy and weakening its claim to impartiality in regional conflict resolution. The path ahead for India requires more than conventional military readiness; it calls for a fundamental reassessment of the strategic assumptions underpinning India's approach to China, particularly regarding Beijing’s role in shaping, enabling, or deferring regional crises. New Delhi’s challenge is two-fold. It must deter asymmetric threats from across the border, and it must decode and counteract the quieter, more insidious enablers of that threat. That means not just stronger borders, but sharper diplomacy. Not just better arms, but better arguments. Narrative warfare, if conducted strategically, allows India not just to defend its position but to shape the global agenda on terrorism and regional order, reinforcing its claim to normative leadership as a rising power. Pahalgam may have been a tragedy for India, but it is also an inflection point. A new foreign policy realism must follow. Because in this geopolitical theatre, the shadows are as dangerous as the swords.

New Delhi has sent 50,000 additional troops to the Himalayan areas of the undemarcated Line of Actual Control (LAC), according to recent Indian media reports. French-made Rafale fighter jets armed with long-range missiles will support soldiers on the ground in Ladakh, who are equipped with 105mm field guns and M777 howitzers. The M777s can be moved from one sector to another with Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. In addition, the military also has 100 K9-Vajra howitzers. Much of the equipment has been redirected from [India](https://www.scmp.com/topics/india?module=inline&pgtype=article)’s border with arch-rival [Pakistan](https://www.scmp.com/topics/pakistan?module=inline&pgtype=article). Meanwhile, [China’s People’s Liberation Army](https://www.scmp.com/topics/china-military?module=inline&pgtype=article) (PLA) has stepped up night drills and brought in more advanced equipment close to the Himalayan border, including new PHL-11 truck mounted self-propelled 122mm multiple rocket launchers. Last weekend, Indian army chief General Manoj Naravane, while on a visit to Leh, the capital of the northeastern region of Ladakh, told local media that the military was matching Chinese deployments and was “quite well poised to meet any eventuality”. Field trials of the K9-Vajra howitzers “were extremely successful”, he said, adding that the army had added an entire regiment of guns. Former military commanders and experts say the deployment signals India’s ongoing shift in posture towards China, from defensive to offensive, even as both sides say they are seeking to further ease tensions in the Himalayan heights of Ladakh. Earlier this year, New Delhi and Beijing agreed to disengage troops at two friction points – the Pangong Tso glacial lake in February, and Gogra in August. India’s focus for the upcoming talks would be for troops to retreat from the Hot Springs area. “It is a very significant shift on India’s part,” said D.S. Hooda, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in chief of the Indian army’s northern command.

Tensions led to a deadly clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15, resulting in fatalities on both sides. This year’s disengagement agreements have prevented the recurrence of major clashes, but Gautam Bambawale, a retired diplomat who served as India’s ambassador in China from 2017 to 2018, said the deployments showed “the situation is dangerous and can turn to conflict at a moment’s notice”. [![](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/10/06/24bb4dba-25c8-11ec-8f06-8f17bcf6e46a_972x_195122.jpeg)\\ \\ PLA soldiers have stepped up night drills and brought in more advanced equipment.

Hence, this is going to be a long-drawn-out situation and India will have to play all its cards adroitly,” he said. India has also begun publicising efforts to ramp up its border infrastructure, with government leaders inaugurating roads and bridges that can be used to facilitate troop movement. Hundreds of people are now working to drill tunnels and construct bridges to connect the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh – which shares borders with Pakistan and China. A 6.5km tunnel, the first of four, is already completed, the Associated Press reported, adding that experts said it would provide logistics flexibility to the military. Observers say this drive will be an irritant to Beijing, which maintains an advantage on its side of the border due to consistent infrastructure upgrades over the past two decades. Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, said New Delhi was also strengthening its deployment in the central sector of the LAC, along the Indian region of Uttarakhand. Indian media had reported that about 100 PLA soldiers had crossed into the Barahoti ridge in August, leading to questions on whether the central sector would also become an area of live bilateral conflict. _The Hindu_ newspaper on Sunday quoted Indian defence ministry officials as saying that the PLA’s pattern of large patrols was a way for China to assert its claim while also testing India across the LAC. The officials added that there was a need for better coordination between the army and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police to avoid surprises such as the Galwan clash. Joshi said China had always had “fairly extensive” claims in Uttarakhand, and while these had remained dormant, the intrusions were a reflection of recent developments, with both sides maintaining forward positions even as they discussed disengagement. India’s formation of two “strike groups” – detachments of between 30-50,000 combat troops – in Arunachal Pradesh, bordering China to the east, and Ladakh to the west signalled its “intention of fighting an aggressive battle should things go haywire,” he said.

Indian foreign ministry officials, however, blame the build-up of troops on China and say its refusal to disengage from border hotspots is the reason for rising tensions. Sushant Singh, a visiting professor of political science at Yale University and senior fellow at Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said the ongoing Sino-Indian tensions were part of the geopolitical context in which Beijing saw New Delhi as part of Washington’s camp. With the revival of the Quad security arrangement involving the United States, Australia, India and Japan, any trust that remained between China and India had “eroded”, he said. Singh argued that India’s deployments were meant to deter escalation, but acknowledged that these tactical moves were now being seen through a “strategic prism” by Beijing. “The limited offensive options being created are of deterrence value, as deterrence through existing defensive options had evidently failed in 2020,” he added. Hooda, the former army commander, said neither side was angling for conflict, but developments showed that both sides clearly needed a new set of confidence-building measures. He said the border with China was likely to become more “contested” in future, though not to the extent of India’s border with Pakistan where rival troops exchange fire at regular intervals. “Both sides clearly need to disengage from the remaining hotspots … avoid armed clashes and avoid patrolling in disputed areas,” he said. “The whole idea is to keep the situation calm along the LAC and avoid escalation.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Delhi ramps up border forces ahead of talks ![](https://assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif) 6",

Reached after years of negotiations to resolve a military standoff that began in eastern Ladakh, the agreement is a testament to the complex yet critical nature of bilateral ties between the two Asian giants and appears to have thawed the otherwise fraught relationship. The two countries [held 21 rounds of corps commander level meetings](https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/37645/21st+round+of+IndiaChina+Corps+Commander+Level+Meeting) seeking complete disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and restoration of normalcy and peace.

While the triangular dynamics between India, China, and Pakistan have been complex, the India-Pakistan [ceasefire](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/world/asia/pakistan-india-ceasefire.html) in 2021 left India to largely focus on its standoff along the LAC and broader competition with China. The resolution of this border standoff indicates that India’s threat perception of China have shifted beyond a purely security calculus to focus on other considerations, such as the resumption of economic ties, and operate independently of its relationship with the United States. However, even though this agreement assuages India’s perceptions of a two-front threat, tensions between India and Pakistan will still persist. The resolution of this border standoff indicates that India’s threat perception of China have shifted beyond a purely security calculus to focus on other considerations, such as the resumption of economic ties, and operate independently of its relationship with the United States. ## Terms of the Agreement The agreement [includes](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-india-china-border-patrol-agreement-and-why-it-is-important-6844560) provisions for both countries to withdraw troops from specific areas of contention along the LAC, to avert risks of any further confrontations. It also outlines structured patrolling arrangements, intended to maintain the status quo and prevent any unilateral changes to the LAC. The agreement also calls for a continuous monitoring system to verify the status of troop withdrawal and patrolling activities, outlining a framework for resolving any future disagreements or stand-offs through dialogue at various levels, from local military commanders to diplomatic channels. It also acknowledges that the broader territorial dispute remains unresolved and opens the door for continued diplomatic engagement to resolve these longstanding issues. The timing of the announcement by India and China – just before both countries were set to attend the [BRICS summit](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/22/russias-brics-summit-whats-on-the-agenda-and-why-does-it-matter) – is noteworthy. The subsequent meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the summit materialized their political alignment to ease tensions and pave the way for improved political and economic ties. ## Impact on India’s Threat Perceptions While there is a sense of relief that the standoff – which had escalated tensions and led to the loss of lives – has moved towards [de-escalation](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg0gwy0nlyo), there is skepticism concerning the agreement’s durability, especially given Indian mistrust of Beijing due to previous [India-China](https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/Bilateral-Brief-Updated_21-August-2023.pdf) border disputes. Thus, the agreement might not necessarily indicate that India and China have completely moved past historical grievances, especially since the lack of detailed public information on the deal’s terms suggests that negotiations may still be ongoing. However, overall, the agreement suggests a shift in India’s perception of China as a threat. A stabilized border [frees up resources](https://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-china-defrost-ties-at-brics-summit-key-expectations-34920.html/) and fosters economic growth. China is India’s [largest trading partner](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/china-beats-us-to-emerge-as-largest-trading-partner-of-india-in-fy24-gtri-124051200126_1.html), and trade between the two countries [surged](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/indias-top-trade-partner-china-regains-spot-on-higher-imports-9324553/) from USD $65 billion in 2020 to over USD $118 billion in 2024. India [relies on Chinese imports](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-23-times-in-15-years-indias-chinese-import-bill-to-rise-further/article68118302.ece) for industrial goods, electronics, machinery, and pharmaceuticals, highlighting the mutual economic reliance that complicates their outright rivalry. In fact, both states have signaled with this agreement that they prioritize pragmatic reasons to seek a temporary peace over strategic concerns. For China, it may diffuse some of the [economic and diplomatic pressure](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/india-china-ties-at-a-crossroads-as-security-economic-pressures-clash-3201218) from the unresolved conflict along the LAC coupled with a slowing domestic economy, real-estate challenges, and Western restrictions on Chinese goods. By easing relations with India, China also seeks to prevent New Delhi from imposing further restrictions on Chinese investments or hardening existing policies. The agreement signals to the West that bloc politics is rendered void when economic considerations come into play. ## U.S. Factor and Triangular Dynamics The border agreement poses a significant question as to its potential impact on the budding relationship between the United States and India. Since the early 2000s, the U.S.-India partnership has [deepened](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/21/joint-fact-sheet-the-united-states-and-india-continue-to-expand-comprehensive-and-global-strategic-partnership/), especially considering India’s participation in initiatives like [the Quad](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/tag/the-quad-alliance-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/) and [I2U2](https://www.state.gov/i2u2/). Their cooperation in the realms of defense, technology, and economic issues reflects shared concerns over China’s regional assertiveness. Consequently, India’s agreement to this deal with China demonstrates India’s desire to bolster its economy, its self-confidence in taming its strong neighbor and securing its borders, and practicing an independent foreign policy from the United States. While India has indicated that it intends to keep working with the United States, its individual handling of its border crisis with China exhibits its desire to keep a multialigned foreign policy. Although the United States applauded the pullback of Chinese and Indian forces from the border, it underlined that it had [no role](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/us-india-china-border-breakthrough-ladakh-standoff-patrolling-deal-resolution-2625358-2024-10-30) in resolving the India-China border dispute. Nonetheless, the improvement in the India-China relationship may also benefit the United States by reducing the risk of conflict in South Asia and allowing for Washington to focus on China’s role in other regions around the world. ## What About Pakistan? The India-China border agreement has a mixed impact on Pakistan **.** Reduced tensions between New Delhi and Beijing facilitate an environment of peace in the region, which bodes well for Islamabad. However, the success of India’s negotiations with China does not indicate a similar improvement in the India-Pakistan relationship. The possibility of any analogous border agreement on the LOC is fraught with challenges that are multifaceted and deeply entrenched, primarily revolving around territorial disputes over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism. However, the success of India’s negotiations with China does not indicate a similar improvement in the India-Pakistan relationship. The possibility of any analogous border agreement on the LOC is fraught with challenges that are multifaceted and deeply entrenched, primarily revolving around territorial disputes over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism. Despite Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar’s [recent visit to Islamabad](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/s-jaishankars-historic-visit-to-pakistan-sco-meeting-internet-calls-him-boss-the-real-hero/articleshow/114249012.cms?from=mdr) for a conclave SCO meeting, his visit did not pertain to the bilateral relationship and has not shown any signs of purposefully engaging to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and other lingering bilateral issues. Strategically, India’s construction of the [INS Varsha, the development of K-4 naval capabilities in the eastern coast](https://issi.org.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IB_Abu_Hurrairah_July_15_2024.pdf), and its cooperation with the U.S.’s Indo-Pacific Strategy raises concerns for Pakistan’s strategic threat perceptions regardless of the border agreement. Nonetheless, reduced tensions on the LAC may ease India’s threat perceptions of a two-front challenge from China and Pakistan, which could indirectly suggest greater Indian appetite for enduring crisis risks on the LOC. In conclusion, the recent India-China border agreement is a positive development in the short term that provides a framework for de-escalation and the resumption of normal patrolling activities. However, the long-term prospects for peace and stability will depend on continuous efforts to address the underlying issues and build a durable framework for conflict resolution and cooperation. The world awaits to see if this agreement will be a harbinger of a new era in India-China relations or just another interlude in a long-standing rivalry. ## Recent & Related Video [South Asian Perspectives on Critical Cyber Threats, Law, and Norms](https://www.stimson.org/2025/south-asian-perspectives-on-critical-cyber-threats-law-and-norms/) Commentary [SAV Q&A with Bidushi Dhungel: Nepal’s Political Revolution and Quest for a More Equitable Future](https://www.stimson.org/2025/sav-qa-with-bidushi-dhungel-nepal/) Commentary [Implications of the SCO Summit Week in China](https://www.stimson.org/2025/implications-of-the-sco-summit-week-in-china/) Daniel Markey • Asfandyar Mir • Peter Slezkine... ## About Stimson ## Transparency ## People ## Contact General - 202.223.5956 - 1211 Connecticut Ave NW, 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 - Fax: 202.238.9604 Media Inquiries - 202.478.3437 - [Caiti Goodman](https://www.stimson.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3b585c54545f565a557b484f52564854551554495c) - [Communications Dept.](https://www.stimson.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9bf8f4f6f6eef5f2f8faeff2f4f5e8dbe8eff2f6e8f4f5b5f4e9fc) - [News & Announcements](https://www.stimson.org/about/stimson/media-announcements/) Copyright The Henry L.

In April, a widespread [power outage in Spain](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) showed how quickly a nation’s energy infrastructure can be stressed. If a similar outage were to occur in the UK and stretch beyond 24 hours, the effects would escalate from inconvenience to systemic risk for financial services: payment flows could seize up, trading could be disrupted, and millions could lose access to banking services. For a sector built on real-time settlement and continuous connectivity, this is a severe but plausible scenario that deserves active monitoring. These vulnerabilities are amplified by mounting pressures on the UK’s power system. Electricity demand is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centres, the electrification of transport and heating. Much of the grid infrastructure is aging, with uneven investment in upgrades. Winter peaks are increasingly shaped by extreme weather, and longer spells of low wind or sun can tighten operating margins just as demand surges. Findings Against this backdrop, the Swift Centre Forecasters were asked: **_Will the UK experience an electricity blackout lasting over 24 hours before December 31st 2026 that severely disrupts financial services?_** ## **Findings** On average, the Swift Centre forecasters put the probability of the UK experiencing a blackout lasting more than 24 hours before the end of 2026 at 7.8%. This means roughly a one-in-twelve chance of a systemic disruption to the UK’s financial services within the next two years. And this figure only covers the most severe case – outages lasting more than 24 hours. Shorter blackouts, which can still disrupt payments and trading, are supposedly more plausible. Behind this headline number, views diverged. A group clustered at the higher end, around 17-18%, emphasising severe weather and infrastructure fragility. Others leaned much lower (0.5-5%), pointing to the historical rarity of such long outages and the grid’s proven resilience. The gap reflects different judgments about what could plausibly drive a multi-day blackout, as well as competing views on the UK’s ability to withstand shocks. Those on the lower end argued that blackouts lasting more than 24 hours are historically rare in the UK and that the grid has generally proven resilient. One noted: “ _We have events that can be considered ‘major’ UK blackouts… However, few if any lasted longer than 12 hours_.” Another gave a 2% estimate but said this would rise to 5-10% if shorter outages were considered. In their view, the most plausible drivers of a multi-day blackout would be supply shortages rather than extreme weather. While storms and floods regularly cause localised outages, these are usually resolved in under 24 hours. By contrast, past rolling blackouts were linked to fuel constraints, and the UK’s relatively small gas storage capacity still represents a vulnerability: > “ _We currently store 12 days’ worth of winter gas demand, compared with 89 days in Germany and 103 days in France._” Even so, they judged that interconnectors to Europe and imports from the U.S. and Middle East make outright shortages unlikely in the forecast period. Cyberattacks were also downplayed as a plausible trigger. The grid remains relatively isolated from the internet, and past incidents (such as the [2019 lightning strike](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d96100340f0b61743bd4cc3/20191003_E3C_Interim_Report_into_GB_Power_Disruption.pdf)) have been rapidly contained: > “A _long, nationwide blackout won’t occur, in spite of the Grid’s finer supply and response time margins._” Others in the low-probability camp nudged their estimates slightly higher (up to 5%), emphasising recent close calls and the challenges of managing a system with more variable renewables. One observed that “ _risk is higher than in the past with increased share of volatile renewables._” Another pointed to the [near-blackout in January 2025](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/09/britain-came-within-whisker-blackouts-national-grid/): “ _Such close calls do make one wonder if the system is sufficiently resilient. But at the same time, that the situation at worst would have resulted in planned blackouts of about three hours._” By contrast, those at the higher end placed more weight on weather and infrastructure fragility. One reasoned that “ _blackouts in the UK are not particularly frequent and almost all of them \\[…\\] are related to severe weather,_” and identified 3-6 instances in the past three decades where outages lasted over 24 hours, leading them to a double digit estimate. Another highlighted specific cases – the [2013 Christmas storms](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c5576e5274a1b0042311a/DECC_-_Festive_disruption_review_-_Final__2_.pdf), [2015 floods](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-35020049), and storms [Arwen (2021)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storm-arwen-electricity-distribution-disruption-review) and [Eunice (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Eunice#:~:text=The%20UK%20was%20particularly%20hard,km%2Fh)%20were%20recorded.) – and concluded that “ _large towns going out for more than 24 hours is quite common._” A third, giving a 17% probability, focused on infrastructure risk, pointing to [Heathrow’s 18-hour outage in 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-into-the-north-hyde-substation-outage-terms-of-reference) as a sign of weak redundancy: > “ _The recent shutdown of Heathrow due to a substation fire showed a weakness in ability to quickly shift to alternative sources._” They also added a small premium for cyberattacks, accounting for around 1.5% of their estimate. ## **If Winter Bites Harder** Forecasters were also asked to assess how their probabilities would change in the event of a severe winter in 2025 or 2026. In this scenario, severe winter was defined as record-low temperatures, low renewable generation, tight gas supplies, or extreme storms. Across the board, forecasters agreed that harsh winter conditions would make a long blackout more likely. Most described the effect as roughly doubling their baseline estimate, though the results varied widely depending on where they had started from. Justifications also differed: some emphasised the compounded stress on gas and renewables, others the physical damage caused by storms, and a few highlighted the risk of global energy supply constraints. For some, the increase was modest in absolute terms. One forecaster, for example, raised their probability from 2% to 4%, explaining: > “ _Even given a severe winter, I think the probability is very low as long as parts of the large town or region have power restored in under 24 hours, so I'm increasing my estimate by only two percentage points._” Another echoed this view, stressing that “ _Individual weather events like blizzards can cause blackouts without mounting to an extreme winter, so I go with a moderate increase._” Others arrived at higher final estimates. One calculated that roughly “ _47% of years with a major outage… would have resolved positively_” under the severe winter condition, leading them to double their baseline estimate to 40%. Another, who considered the combined risks of high winds, low temperature, major snow or ice storm, argued that resilience would be lower in such circumstances: > “ _Even the loss of a couple of power stations would be a major concern to the UK’s power grid._” They concluded that the probability would be about double their baseline, at 9.8%. Several forecasters pointed to infrastructure fragility and gas reliance as the key vulnerabilities exposed by severe winter conditions. One noted: > “ _The UK increasingly relies on natural gas and renewables. Given such reliance, a period of extreme cold along with low winds could \\[cause\\] selective power outages_.” Another cited National Energy System Operator projections showing “ _the strongest electricity operational margins for the UK grid since 2019,_” but still allowed for the possibility that an unusually cold winter could coincide with global demand pressures and LNG import shortages, settling on a 20% estimate. A final forecaster placed their probability at 25%, reasoning that while severe weather is rare in the UK, it can be very difficult to repair quickly when it does occur: > “ _Ice storms are very rare in the UK, but if they occur, can be devastating to power lines and time-consuming to repair. … I expect that loss of power to a medium-sized city for 24 hours is a relatively low bar and would be difficult to solve without repairs of numerous transmission lines._” ## **Knock-On Effects on Banking Services** Forecasters were also asked to estimate the likelihood that such a blackout would prevent at least 100,000 people in the UK from accessing their bank accounts before 2027. All forecasters judged this outcome to be plausible, with estimates ranging from 30% to 75% and averaging 58%. That implies better than even odds that a major blackout would leave more than 100,000 people unable to access their bank accounts. While confidence levels varied, the consensus was clear: a prolonged outage would almost certainly disrupt financial services on a large scale. At the top end, one forecaster assigned a 75% probability, arguing that the scale of disruption in a 24-hour+ blackout would inevitably capture this many people. Others supported this view with slightly lower estimates. One (62%) explained: > “ _If it lasts for more than 24 hours, it’s likely a nationwide blackout… This very likely means that more than 100,000 people would be unable to access their bank accounts or make payments for at least 12 hours._” Another (63%) stressed that “ _branches and ATMs would naturally be down… The last break point could be the one that matters the most, since an increasing number of people rely on the internet to bank._” Several other forecasters converging around the 50-60% range, emphasised that mundane banking services would fail under these conditions. One wrote: > “ _Should a blackout happen, just about everyone affected by a blackout will lose online access to bank accounts. The main banks may function OK for some time but \\[the\\] majority of the cashpoints will be down. And of course 99% of stores of all kinds will not be able to receive card payments._” Another added that “ _even for those with access to banking by phone app and laptop, cell tower operation, internet service, and the ability to recharge devices are likely to put the number over 100,000._” The only forecaster at the lower end (30%) argued that the internet is not always disabled during power outages, and that people might continue using phones and other battery-operated devices, limiting the number directly affected. Despite these differences, the consensus was clear: once a 24-hours blackout occurs, cascading failures across ATMs, payment systems, telecommunications, and local infrastructure make it highly likely that at least 100,000 people will lose access to their bank accounts. ## **Conclusion** Forecasters judged a multi-day UK blackout to be relatively unlikely – in the single digits under normal conditions – yet the aggregated estimate of 7.8% (with highs of 18%) is still concerning. For a risk that could paralyse payments, trading, and customer access to banking services, even single-digit probabilities amount to a material threat. The risk also rises further under severe winter conditions, with several forecasters effectively doubling their baseline estimates in that scenario. And the consensus was clear: if such a blackout were to occur, the impact on the financial system would be severe.

A final forecaster placed their probability at 25%, reasoning that while severe weather is rare in the UK, it can be very difficult to repair quickly when it does occur: > “ _Ice storms are very rare in the UK, but if they occur, can be devastating to power lines and time-consuming to repair. … I expect that loss of power to a medium-sized city for 24 hours is a relatively low bar and would be difficult to solve without repairs of numerous transmission lines._” ## **Knock-On Effects on Banking Services** Forecasters were also asked to estimate the likelihood that such a blackout would prevent at least 100,000 people in the UK from accessing their bank accounts before 2027. All forecasters judged this outcome to be plausible, with estimates ranging from 30% to 75% and averaging 58%. That implies better than even odds that a major blackout would leave more than 100,000 people unable to access their bank accounts. While confidence levels varied, the consensus was clear: a prolonged outage would almost certainly disrupt financial services on a large scale. At the top end, one forecaster assigned a 75% probability, arguing that the scale of disruption in a 24-hour+ blackout would inevitably capture this many people. Others supported this view with slightly lower estimates. One (62%) explained: > “ _If it lasts for more than 24 hours, it’s likely a nationwide blackout… This very likely means that more than 100,000 people would be unable to access their bank accounts or make payments for at least 12 hours._” Another (63%) stressed that “ _branches and ATMs would naturally be down… The last break point could be the one that matters the most, since an increasing number of people rely on the internet to bank._” Several other forecasters converging around the 50-60% range, emphasised that mundane banking services would fail under these conditions. One wrote: > “ _Should a blackout happen, just about everyone affected by a blackout will lose online access to bank accounts. The main banks may function OK for some time but \\[the\\] majority of the cashpoints will be down. And of course 99% of stores of all kinds will not be able to receive card payments._” Another added that “ _even for those with access to banking by phone app and laptop, cell tower operation, internet service, and the ability to recharge devices are likely to put the number over 100,000._” The only forecaster at the lower end (30%) argued that the internet is not always disabled during power outages, and that people might continue using phones and other battery-operated devices, limiting the number directly affected. Despite these differences, the consensus was clear: once a 24-hours blackout occurs, cascading failures across ATMs, payment systems, telecommunications, and local infrastructure make it highly likely that at least 100,000 people will lose access to their bank accounts. ## **Conclusion** Forecasters judged a multi-day UK blackout to be relatively unlikely – in the single digits under normal conditions – yet the aggregated estimate of 7.8% (with highs of 18%) is still concerning. For a risk that could paralyse payments, trading, and customer access to banking services, even single-digit probabilities amount to a material threat. The risk also rises further under severe winter conditions, with several forecasters effectively doubling their baseline estimates in that scenario. And the consensus was clear: if such a blackout were to occur, the impact on the financial system would be severe.

America’s power grid is straining under the weight of a fast-changing energy landscape. Beyond the usual summer hum of air conditioners, power demand is surging from electric vehicle chargers and sprawling new data centers. At the same time, the infrastructure built to deliver reliable electricity is aging and showing its limits. From Texas heatwaves to California blackouts, the warning signs are impossible to ignore. This isn’t a technical challenge—it’s an economic and political reckoning. If the grid fails, it won’t be because we lacked solutions. It will be because we didn’t act quickly enough. ## **A Demand Surge Few Anticipated** For nearly two decades, U.S. electricity demand was flat. Now, consumption is climbing, driven by technologies that arrived faster than planners expected. Artificial intelligence has unleashed a wave of data center construction. These facilities, dense with high-performance servers and cooling systems, are among the most power-hungry assets in the country. In 2023, AI data centers consumed about [4.4% of U.S. electricity](https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it), and that share could triple by 2028, according to Penn State’s Institute of Energy and the Environment. Northern Virginia—“Data Center Alley”— [now handles 70% of global internet traffic](https://oxfordamerican.org/oa-now/how-data-center-alley-is-changing-northern-virginia), pushing utilities like Dominion Energy to scramble for capacity. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google warn that a shortage of skilled electricians could delay expansion, with estimates that the U.S. will need [500,000 more electricians](https://www.ciphernews.com/hot-take/500000-electricians/) in the next decade. Electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electrified industry are adding further strain. The Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projects growth [equivalent to seven Seattle-sized cities](https://www.nwcouncil.org/fs/18720/2024_05_3.pdf) within ten years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. electricity sales to rise from [4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/elec_coal_renew.php), with similar gains to follow. And finally, there’s climate. As extreme heat events multiply, cooling demand in places like Texas and Arizona is surging—driving peak loads to new records. ## **The Supply Gap: Retirements Outpace Replacement** Just as demand is accelerating, the U.S. is retiring some of its most dependable sources of power. [The EIA projects](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64604) 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity will retire in 2025, a 65% jump over 2024. That includes 8.1 GW of coal, such as the 1,800-MW Intermountain Power Project in Utah, plus another 2.6 GW of natural gas. These plants provide round-the-clock power that intermittent sources cannot yet replace. Wind and solar capacity continue to grow, but not fast enough. The Department of Energy’s July 2025 [Resource Adequacy Report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/DOE%20Final%20EO%20Report%20%28FINAL%20JULY%207%29_0.pdf) warns that only 22 GW of firm generation is expected by 2030—well short of the 104 GW needed for peak demand. Transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and slow adoption of long-duration storage compound the problem. Grid operators from PJM, MISO, ERCOT, and others [told Congress bluntly](https://www.powermag.com/nations-power-operators-warn-congress-of-a-coming-reliability-shortfall/) in March 2025: “Demand is accelerating, supply is lagging, and current tools may not be enough to bridge the gap.” ## **Growing Vulnerabilities: Weather, Cyber, and Sabotage** Beyond the supply-demand imbalance, the grid faces mounting risks. Heatwaves, wildfires, and storms are stressing transmission systems nationwide. Events once considered rare—like the 2003 Northeast blackout that hit 50 million people—are now seen as precursors of larger disruptions. As smart grids and distributed resources proliferate, so do digital entry points for hackers. In 2024, [DOE funded 16 cybersecurity projects](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/department-energy-awards-42-million-guard-power-grid-cyber-threats), including Georgia Tech’s AI-based “DerGuard” system to monitor risks in distributed energy. Sabotage at substations and transmission lines is also rising. With more than 160,000 miles of high-voltage lines and 7,300 plants, much of it decades old, the system is a sprawling, exposed target. [Homeland Security now classifies grid protection](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors) alongside nuclear and water infrastructure. ## **Policy Gridlock and Infrastructure Delays** Despite the alarms, policy responses remain sluggish. Jurisdiction is a big part of the problem. Regional transmission operators manage the grid but don’t own generation or lines. Utilities do, while states control siting and permitting. The result is a patchwork that slows progress. As of mid-2024, transmission projects across the U.S. [faced delays](https://www.wapa.gov/supply-chains/) of five to seven years due to permitting hurdles, interconnection bottlenecks, and supply chain constraints. By mid-2025, lead times for large power transformers had stretched beyond 30 months, with some units requiring up to four years for delivery—posing serious risks to grid reliability and expansion. Even bipartisan efforts like the [CIRCUIT Act](https://www.maddox.com/resources/articles/circuit-act)—introduced in February 2025 to incentivize domestic transformer production through a 10% tax credit—remain stalled in committee, despite widespread industry support and urgent supply chain concerns. Meanwhile, subsidies continue to favor intermittent renewables over firm capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act accelerated clean energy deployment, but without parallel investment in balancing technologies, reliability risks grow. ## **What’s Being Done** Federal and private efforts are ramping up, though often as short-term fixes. DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants and issued reliability directives under the Federal Power Act. These measures keep the lights on but do little to build long-term resilience. DOE also aims to increase long-distance capacity 16% by 2030, adding 7,500 miles of new lines. But permitting delays and local resistance remain obstacles. In 2025, [DOE launched $32 million](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/15/us-doe-invests-32-million-for-grid-edge-technology-and-smart-charge-management/) in pilot projects for smart EV charging, responsive buildings, and distributed energy integration. These solutions could eventually scale, but utilities and regulators must buy in. ## **Investor Implications: Reliability as a Premium** For investors, grid instability is a risk, but also an opportunity. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion, and Avangrid are investing billions in grid modernization and diversified generation. Avangrid alone plans $20 billion through 2030 across 23 states. Independent power producers are also benefiting from the shifting landscape. NRG Energy, one of the nation’s largest competitive power suppliers, has seen its shares climb sharply as rising demand boosts wholesale electricity prices. Unlike regulated utilities, NRG and its peers compete in deregulated markets, where higher load growth and tighter capacity directly translate into stronger margins. That dynamic could make competitive generators an overlooked winner in a strained grid environment. Firms like Fluence, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are seeing growing demand for storage and microgrid solutions. Pilot programs backed by DOE may open new markets for software-driven load management. With coal exiting and renewables constrained, power generated by nuclear energy and natural gas retain a “reliability premium.” [Deloitte estimates](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/funding-growth-in-us-power-sector.html) the U.S. power sector will need $1.4 trillion in new capital between 2025 and 2030, with similar levels required through 2050. Firms able to supply firm generation or grid services stand to benefit. ## **Conclusion: Crisis or Course Correction?** The U.S. power grid isn’t collapsing—but it is under pressure like never before. Demand growth, baseload retirements, extreme weather, and policy paralysis are colliding to create a fragile system. Whether this moment becomes a crisis or a correction depends on how quickly policymakers, utilities, and investors adapt. The tools exist—firm generation, smart load management, and modern transmission. But without faster coordination and realistic incentives, the U.S. risks trading energy abundance for energy fragility.

Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters The loan will come from a commercial bank, backed by the Department for Business and Trade's (DBT) Export Development Guarantee (EDG), provided by export credit agency UK Export Finance, to be paid back over five years. The aim is to bolster JLR's cash reserves following the production shutdown since early this month in the wake of the hack to help support firms in the supply chain, many of them small and medium enterprises (SMEs) struggling to stay afloat. “This cyber-attack was not only an assault on an iconic British brand, but on our world-leading automotive sector and the men and women whose livelihoods depend on it,” said Peter Kyle, Business and Trade Secretary. “Following our decisive action, this loan guarantee will help support the supply chain and protect skilled jobs in the West Midlands, Merseyside and throughout the UK,” he said. The minister said it was a vote of confidence in the country's automotive sector, which stands to benefit in the long term through “landmark trade deals” including the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India. “Jaguar Land Rover is an iconic British company which employs tens of thousands of people – a jewel in the crown of our economy. \"Today we are protecting thousands of those jobs with up to 1.5 billion pounds in additional private finance, helping them support their supply chain and protect a vital part of the British car industry,” said Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The announcement follows a visit this week by Kyle and Industry Minister Sarah Jones to JLR's Gaydon headquarters in the West Midlands region of England and a tour of JLR's sunroof manufacturer Webasto to meet senior leaders and workers. “With plants in Solihull and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, plus Halewood in Merseyside, JLR is one of the UK's largest exporters and a major employer – employing 34,000 directly in its UK operations. \"It also operates the largest supply chain in the UK automotive sector, much of it made up of SMEs, and employing around 120,000 people,” DBT said. The department said it remains in daily contact with JLR and cyber experts to address concerns and offer support to get production back online, which is not expected until next month. In an update issued on Thursday, JLR said it is working to clear the “backlog of payments\" to its suppliers by increasing its processing capacity for invoicing. “As part of the controlled, phased restart of our operations, we have informed colleagues, suppliers and retail partners that sections of our digital estate are now up and running,” the JLR statement said. “The foundational work of our recovery programme is firmly underway. We have significantly increased IT processing capacity for invoicing. \"We are now working to clear the backlog of payments to our suppliers as quickly as we can,” it said. Britain's largest car manufacturer said the Global Parts Logistics Centre, which supplies parts to distribution centres for its retail partners in the UK and around the world, is returning to “full operations”. “This will enable our retail partners to continue to service our clients' vehicles and keep our customers mobile. \"The financial system we use to process the wholesales of vehicles has been brought back online and we are able to sell and register vehicles for our clients faster, delivering important cash flow,” it added. JLR said its teams continue to work around the clock alongside cybersecurity specialists, the UK government's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and law enforcement to ensure the restart of full operations takes place in a “safe and secure manner” following a “difficult time for all connected with JLR”. A group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is believed to have claimed responsibility for the hack. It was also behind a number of other high-profile attacks on UK retailers this year, including Marks & Spencer and Co-op. Most recently, London's luxury department store Harrods has reported a cyber-attack this week in which some customer data is said to have been stolen.

While the two sides have not engaged in significant cross-border clashes since 2020, they are maintaining large troop deployments, and sporadic encounters between opposing forces risk miscalculation and escalation into armed conflict,” states the annual threat assessment of the US intelligence community, released by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on Monday, as it talks about potential inter-state conflicts. The report highlights a fragile global order, China’s military expansion plans, its aggressive cyber operations and its possible attempt to influence the 2024 US presidential elections. It further talks about other conflicts including the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war. Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week inaugurated the strategic Sela tunnel, built at an altitude of 13,000 feet in Arunachal Pradesh, that will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang. Infrastructure projects near Indo-China border have gathered pace since a military standoff with China in Ladakh sector of the [Line of Actual Control](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-stern-warning-to-india-on-deploying-more-border-troops-won-t-ease-tensions-101709890661820.html)(LAC) began in May 2020. Both sides have arrayed close to 50,000 troops each in Ladakh sector and India has made it clear that bilateral relations cannot be normalised till there is peace and tranquility in the border areas. The report also points to possible armed conflict between India and Pakistan as well in case of any provocations from Islamabad. “New Delhi and Islamabad are inclined to sustain the current fragile calm in their relationship following their renewal of a cease-fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in early 2021. However, neither side has used this period of calm to rebuild their bilateral ties as each government has focused on more pressing domestic priorities including election perpetrations and campaigning and for Pakistan, concerns over rising militant attacks in its west,” the report underscores. “Pakistan’s long history of supporting anti-India militant groups and India’s increased willingness, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to respond with military force to perceived or real Pakistani provocations raise the risk of escalation during a crisis. There remains the potential for an event to trigger a rapid escalation,” it added. On China’s plans to create overseas bases in India’s neighbourhood and other areas, the report states that the [People’s Liberation Army (PLA)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/view-se-la-tunnel-will-allow-faster-indian-response-in-case-of-chinese-aggression-101709984264115.html) will “continue to pursue the establishment of overseas military installations and access agreements in an attempt to project power and protect China’s interests abroad”. “Beyond developing its military base in Djibouti and its military facility at Ream Naval base in Cambodia, Beijing reportedly is considering pursuing military facilities in multiple locations, including—but not limited to—Burma, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and the UAE,” it says. The report notes that Beijing will focus on building a fully modernized national defense and military force by 2035 and for the PLA to become a world-class military by 2049. “In the meantime, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) hopes to use the PLA to secure what it claims is its sovereign territory, to assert its preeminence in regional affairs, and to project power globally, particularly by being able to deter and counter an intervention by the United States in a cross-Strait conflict”, it adds.

The island-wide outage, which hit just after 9am local time on Wednesday, is believed to be linked to a malfunction at one of Cuba’s largest thermoelectric plants, the Ministry of Energy and Mines said. ## Recommended Stories list of 4 items - list 1 of 4 [Cuba restores power grid but planned outages to resume amid energy crisis](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/5/cuba-restores-power-grid-but-planned-outages-to-resume-amid-energy-crisis) - list 2 of 4 [Cuba forced to ‘paralyse economy’ amid desperate energy crisis](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/18/cuba-forced-to-paralyse-economy-amid-desperate-energy-crisis) - list 3 of 4 [Photos: Cuba struggles to get energy grid back online after blackout](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/10/19/cuba-struggles-to-get-energy-grid-back-online-after-nationwide-blackout) - list 4 of 4 [Cuba extends workplace, school shutdowns in wake of power blackouts](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/23/cuba-extends-workplace-school-shutdowns-in-wake-of-power-blackouts) end of list The ministry said crews had been dispatched to build a microsystem capable of providing basic services, and were prioritising the return of electricity to essential sites such as hospitals and food production plants. On Thursday, the national electricity company said power was restored to 11 of Cuba’s 15 provinces. The Cuban Electric Union said on X that 79.4 percent of households in the capital Havana have electricity again after a blackout that lasted nearly 24 hours. “The SEN (National Electric System) has been reconnected, with restoration still pending” in four provinces, the company added. Earlier, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero also made an appearance on state TV at Cuba’s state-run power company, asking Cubans for their trust and promising that electricity would be restored gradually. Cuba’s worsening economic and energy crisis has led to repeated daily blackouts and full grid outages. In March, a [breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/15/huge-power-outage-in-cuba-leaves-millions-in-darkness) at a substation in Havana led to rolling blackouts across the island, with three more blackouts [occurring](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/4/millions-without-power-as-cuba-hit-by-another-nationwide-blackout) late last year. Across Havana on Wednesday, traffic lights were down as people scurried around to buy groceries and basic goods before dark. Pumps supplying the capital’s apartments with water rely on electricity. Havana resident Danai Hernandez [told](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/9/10/cuba-hit-with-fifth-nationwide-blackout-in-less-than-a-year#flips-6379047661112:0) Al Jazeera she had left work to prepare her home for the blackout. “We just have to wait. There’s no other choice,” she said. “We’re cooking with wood and charcoal, so we have to adjust our schedules,” resident Ernesto Gutierrez told Al Jazeera. “It’s complicated, stressful, and frustrating, too.” Cuba’s energy supply crisis has deteriorated in recent years because of US sanctions, which prevent it from holding sufficient foreign currency to upgrade or repair fast-ageing plants that have been in use for more than three decades. Havana has tried to fill the gap by renting floating Turkish power ships and installing Chinese-funded solar parks. Some wealthier families have installed rechargeable devices and solar panels in their homes. Still, the blackouts have prompted rare [protests](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/18/cuba-hundreds-protest-long-blackouts-tight-economy), with crowds flooding the second-largest city of Santiago last year.",

This year, a leading engineering society [graded](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/issues/magazine-issue/article/2025/05/the-urgent-need-for-energy-infrastructure-improvements) the country’s energy system a D+; 70 percent of transmission lines are more than 25 years old, 55 percent of transformers are near end of life, and the average lead time for new transformers is over a year. On top of all that, hotter and more frequent heat waves are degrading the grid. Despite these deficiencies, new demands are being made of the system, from massive new “hyperscale” data centers and more electric vehicle charging stations to the onshoring of manufacturing. Additionally, as temperatures rise and cyberattacks boosted by artificial intelligence (AI) become more potent, the United States needs to invest in a more resilient grid—or risk an energy insecure future. #### Past and future risks to grid reliability Threats to electricity systems include many new and evolving digital and physical risks to companies, cities, and individuals, including disruptions to technological and communications services. On the physical side, floods, fires, and extreme heat events, which are [increasingly posing physical threats](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/weather-related-power-outages-rising) to energy infrastructure. Digital threats come in the form of ransomware and other cyberattacks, and sometimes arise simply out of the enormous complexity of today’s systems. For example, the [2024 CrowdStrike disruption](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/delta-crowdstrike-global-it-outage-explained)—which was caused by a faulty software update that crashed Windows systems worldwide—affected US Department of Energysystems as well as those at a number of [electric utilities](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/outage-management/widespread-technology-outage-disrupts-flights-banks-media-outlets-and-companies-around-the-world/), and stranded or otherwise impacted 1.3 million airline passengers. When these events occur, disruptions to commerce and society follow and highlight the obligations that infrastructure planners and defenders have to limit harm from such incidents—obligations that simply cannot be deferred. And yet, upgrades to some of the most important parts of US critical infrastructure arebeing deferred. Today, on average, large US grid transformers, which are essential to electricity reliability, are [past their designed lifespan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/EXEC-2022-001242%20-%20Large%20Power%20Transformer%20Resilience%20Report%20signed%20by%20Secretary%20Granholm%20on%207-10-24.pdf), and the backlog for replacements is [often three years or more](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/reshore-electrical-equipment-backlogs-transformer-breaker-nema/749265/). Grid operators—and all who depend on the grid—are forced to rely on this old equipment. Meanwhile, [rising temperatures are aging grid components faster](https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/climate-and-natural-catastrophe-risk/impact-of-climate-on-electric-grids.html#:~:text=Global%20warming%20projections%20of%202,(%3E%204%C2%B0C)) by increasing chemical and mechanical stress on them, which leads to reduced efficiency, faster degradation, and increased failure rates. In addition to these long-standing challenges, three major trends have recently emerged that place additional pressure on the electric system: electricity-hungry, AI-powering data centers; the increasing number of electric vehicles and charging stations; and the electrification of everything, perhaps best represented by [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces) replacing oil and gas-burning furnaces. At the same time, the nation is confronted with operational risks and constraints that US grid managers are struggling mightily to manage, such as how to handle increasing shares of non-dispatchable renewable generation as well as rapid policy changes like executive orders to keep coal plants running and restart shuttered nuclear plants. #### Disruption drives agile solutions There is a way forward, inspired by past grid failures and wartime emergencies. When challenged with disruptions, grid operators have not only responded with agility but also applied lessons learned to greatly reduce the potential for future cascades. The Northeastern blackout of 2003, for example, provided a major wake-up call. It affected [50 million people and cost about $6 billion](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2003-blackout-five-years-later/). While numerous improvements followed, three in particular did much to improve the [US grid’s resilience posture](https://www.energy.gov/oe/articles/blackout-2003-blackout-final-implementation-report) via enhanced communications: the installation by the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Committee (NERC) of a new conference bridge to greatly enhance communications during crises; the creation of a new set of procedures and protocols for reliability coordinator hotline calls; and enhancements to the decentralized system data exchange network with automated hourly uploads of outage data. Another example—a far more devastating one—is Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in Ukraine. Under heavy attacks aimed at knocking out civilian infrastructure, Ukrainians, in a show of unity, deployed backup generators and battery packs in unprecedented numbers, adhered to strict schedules for electricity usage set by the utilities, and—as much as possible—decentralized power generation. Although the United States is not at war, the impacts of climate change and cyberattacks could have similar effects on infrastructure and require similar solutions. To address the growing demand for electricity, the United States must generate and deliver much greater quantities of electricity reliably, safely, and securely, all while limiting emissions. Enhanced demand management, as practiced with precision in Ukraine, is one tool that may help. #### Anticipating future challenges The truth is that the US electric system is not operating the way it was designed. That’s because its developers did not anticipate the arrival of such dynamism. Meeting new challenges will require leadership and collective will, and for society to make itself more resilient by preparing in advance for more and longer-duration outages with backup generators and microgrids. To meet the challenges of a future where energy demand keeps rising, warming temperatures place new pressures on critical infrastructure, and cyber criminals threaten to cause massive disruption, the United States must leverage its collective imagination to rally its businesses and citizens to prepare for a less reliable grid. This is accomplished, in part, by full-scale exercises like NERC’s biennial [GridEx](https://www.nerc.com/pa/CI/ESISAC/Pages/GridEx.aspx) series, as well as through regional resilience summits. The property of resilience isn’t required until there is scarcity, a stressor, or other forms of adversity. It comes into play when an entity doesn’t have all that it needs or is under assault, but, by prior preparation, is not defeated. _[Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) is the senior grid strategist for Idaho National Laboratory’s National and Homeland Security directorate._ ## About the author Former fellow ### [Andy Bochman](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Former Nonresident Senior Fellow](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/andy-bochman/) [Global Energy Center](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/our-programs/global-energy-center/) [Cybersecurity](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/cybersecurity/) [Energy & Environment](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/energy-environment/) ## Stay Connected #### Sign up for PowerPlay, the Atlantic Council’s bimonthly newsletter keeping you up to date on all facets of the energy transition ## related content [EnergySourceAug 28, 2025\\ \\ **Overheated and underbuilt: How to fortify the US grid in the face of heat waves** \\ \\ ByFrank Willey\\ \\ As demand for electricity rises across the United States—and in the Mid-Atlantic in particular—to cool homes and power data center growth, so does its cost.

In a fiery post on Truth Social, Donald Trump said that while India is a “friend”, it has imposed some of the “highest tariffs” on the United States and maintained “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers. The announcement comes after a slew of negotiated trade frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia — all of which Trump said would open markets for American goods while enabling the US to raise tax rates on imports. Donald Trump's 25% tariff announcement was met with strong criticism from Opposition leaders. Indian trade bodies have also voiced disappointment, with leaders in India’s gems and jewellery sector warning of short-term disruptions, job losses, and higher prices for US buyers, reported ANI.

The currency market had clearly priced this eventually as the USDINR pair moved by more than 70 paise today. The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30% of India’s pharma exports.

This demonstrates how cyber operations have evolved beyond merely gathering intelligence. When first identified by US government partners back in mid-2023, the campaign by the Salt Typhoon group was assessed as a targeted espionage effort against US and allied government systems. It involved stealthy intrusions, selective data theft and probing of networks in a handful of countries. At the time, the effect was thought to be limited and largely confined to government targets. But August 2025 disclosures have shown just how broad the campaign truly has been. The Australian Signals Directorate, working with 20 foreign partners, has [publicly attributed](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-of-networks-worldwide-to-feed-global-espionage-system) the operation to Beijing’s Ministry of State Security and People’s Liberation Army. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation now assesses that Salt Typhoon has struck dozens of countries, sweeping up telecommunications, transport, lodging and civilian data on a massive scale.These operations may have reached virtually every Australian household and millions more across partner nations. Cyber operations now function as tools for coercion and competition, influencing the balance of power across the Indo-Pacific. They are central to rivalry. Even as governments invest in resilience and attempt to set boundaries, the persistent tension between the United States and China ensures that new vulnerabilities and threats will continue to emerge. The Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of 21st-century competition. China and the US vie for influence, while South Korea, India, Japan and Southeast Asian countries all face mounting digital vulnerabilities. With the digital economy of Southeast Asian nations expected to surpass US$1 [trillion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/asean-building-trust-digital-economy/) by 2030, growth is driving their prosperity but also compounding risk. Chinese-sponsored hackers have been targeting critical infrastructure for a long time. Suspected Chinese hackers disrupted India’s [port](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/securing-indian-ports-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-and-the-road-ahead) logistics in 2020, and repeated intrusions have targeted Japanese, South Korean and Australian energy grids, telecom systems and government networks. Cyber operations are applied to traditional hotspots—such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait—by threatening disruption without any shots being fired. Beyond the sheer number of cyber incidents, patterns in their objectives distinguish cyber operations in the Indo-Pacific from those in other regions. Three stand out: probing, pressuring, and threshold testing. Probing operations aim to identify and target system vulnerabilities. Chinese threat group APT41 often employs this method. The [group](https://cyberscoop.com/apt41-fireeye-china/) has conducted espionage operations across healthcare, telecoms and government agencies for many years. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has perfected a distinct form of probing: cyber-heists, ranging from the 2016 Bangladesh Bank [hack](https://cyber.uk/areas-of-cyber-security/cyber-security-threat-groups-2/nation-state-hackers-case-study-bangladesh-bank-heist/) to ongoing cryptocurrency thefts that directly fund Pyongyang’s weapons programs. These operations map vulnerabilities and generate funds, while staying below the threshold of conventional war. Australia has been a repeated target of pressuring tactics, with the [breaches](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024) of critical infrastructure widely interpreted as signaling that Canberra’s alignment with Washington has costs. Taiwan is another case in point. During its 2024 elections, disinformation campaigns, distributed denial-of-service attacks on government portals, and breaches of media outlets sought to [undermine](https://saferinternetlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Panel-4-Summer.pdf) confidence in the democratic process. These pressures were synchronised with more visible coercion, such as military exercises and air incursions, illustrating how digital operations complement kinetic manoeuvres. Some cyber campaigns appear to be aimed at threshold-testing, blurring the line between espionage and sabotage. In the Vietnam–China cyber [clashes](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/vietnams-securitisation-of-cybersecurity-under-growing-chinese-cyber-threats/) related to South China Sea disputes, Vietnamese hackers allegedly targeted Chinese government websites. Similarly, the 2021 Japan Olympics cyberattacks, which [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098) attributed to Russian actors, demonstrated how geopolitical rivalries could extend into civilian life. Together, these incidents outline a region where states and non-state actors continually challenge each other’s resolve. Skirmishes might not cause immediate destruction, but they foster digital coercion and raise the risk of escalation. Cyber campaigns are not just harassment; some signal a potential for escalation. Attacks against Taiwan’s government networks have spiked during Chinese military drills, showing how cyber and kinetic tools are increasingly integrated. The danger lies in miscalculation. A ransomware strike that disrupts Japan’s energy grid or South Korea’s financial sector could be interpreted as state-backed aggression, prompting military responses. In cyberspace, where [attribution](https://academic.oup.com/isp/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isp/ekae022/7903056) is murky and timeframes are compressed, escalation could outrun diplomacy. Repeated incidents also risk normalising cyber coercion as a standard tool of statecraft. If probing and pressure go unchallenged, adversaries will keep pushing until the region faces a full-scale digital confrontation. The Indo-Pacific has become a laboratory for cyber conflict, setting global precedents. Europe, Latin America and Africa should watch closely: today’s coercion in Asia could become tomorrow’s global standard. Cyber skirmishes in the Indo-Pacific mark the cutting edge of strategic competition, where adversaries test limits and normalise coercion. The region’s growing dependence on digital infrastructure, combined with its strategic volatility, makes it a perilous testing ground for cyber conflict globally. The choice is stark: treat these incidents as minor disruptions until one sparks a crisis, or act to strengthen resilience, deepen cooperation and set rules for [responsible](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/curbing-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-fragmentation-an-agenda-for-harmonisation-across-the-indo-pacific/) behaviour in cyberspace. If governments fail, adversaries will decide the thresholds for acceptable action—and by then it may be too late.

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two...",

Local fire and rescue services said they had received a 'substantial' number of calls from members of the public trapped in elevators, while the government confirmed that the outage was 'caused by damage from a contractor'. 'Due to the power failure, our control room is receiving substantial number of calls from persons trapped in lifts', the Gibraltar Fire and Rescue Services said in a statement. 'All appliances responding to incidents throughout Gibraltar. Crews are being redeployed to attend to these numerous calls'. A Gibraltar-bound British Airways flight from London Heathrow has been diverted to Malaga airport, but the airline is yet to confirm whether this was related to the outage. The Gibraltar Electric Authority confirmed the blackout, writing in a statement on X that engineers were currently working to restore power. Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory at the southern tip of Spain, which was struck by a sweeping power outage just a few months ago. Gibraltar was struck by a total power outage on Tuesday afternoon leaving dozens of residents trapped in lifts The power-cut in April has gone down in history as one of the worst ever in Europe after it affected tens of millions of people across the Iberian Peninsula for several hours. It disrupted businesses, hospitals, transit systems, cellular networks and other critical infrastructure. Emergency services and rail workers in Spain had to help evacuate some 35,000 people from over 100 trains that stopped on the tracks when the electricity was cut. Spain's government said in a report in June that its grid operator Redeia had miscalculated the correct mix of energy in the system. The government also blamed some conventional power plants, or thermal power plants using coal, gas and nuclear, for failing to help maintain an appropriate voltage level and as a result, the grid was unable to cope with a surge in voltage that triggered a cascade of power plant disconnections, ultimately leading to the outage. This is a breaking news story, more to follow.",

The United States’ power grid, once a marvel of 20th-century engineering, is now teetering on the edge of collapse. As demand surges from emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles, an aging infrastructure struggles to keep up. Recent blackouts, escalating costs, and regulatory bottlenecks are painting a picture of a system pushed to its limits. This article explores the crisis, what investors should watch for moving forward, and the ripple effects on everyday consumers, drawing on expert analysis and recent data. ### The Cracks in the Foundation: Why the Grid is Failing ### [Are you Paying High Taxes in New Jersey, New York, or California?](https://energynewsbeat.co/invest/) America’s electrical grid was largely built in the mid-20th century, with much of its transmission and distribution infrastructure now over 50 years old. According to recent reports, the grid faces unprecedented stress from a combination of factors. Electricity demand is skyrocketing: AI data centers alone consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure projected to triple by 2028. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts electricity sales to climb from 4,097 billion kWh in 2024 to 4,193 billion kWh in 2025, equivalent to adding the power needs of seven Seattle-sized cities in the next decade. Extreme weather exacerbates the vulnerabilities. Heatwaves in Texas and storms in California have triggered widespread blackouts, reminiscent of the 2003 Northeast blackout that left 50 million people in the dark. Cybersecurity threats and physical attacks on substations are on the rise, with the Department of Homeland Security emphasizing the grid’s critical status. Supply chain issues further compound the problem: lead times for large power transformers have stretched beyond 30 months by mid-2025, delaying essential upgrades. Regulatory hurdles add to the chaos. Transmission projects face five-to-seven-year delays due to permitting issues, jurisdictional disputes between utilities, states, and federal agencies, and policy gridlock. The CIRCUIT Act, introduced in February 2025 to boost domestic transformer production, remains stalled in Congress. Deloitte estimates that the U.S. power sector will require $1.4 trillion in new capital investments between 2025 and 2030 just to maintain reliability. ### Investment Opportunities: Where to Look as the Crisis Unfolds For investors, this gridlock isn’t just a headache—it’s a goldmine of opportunities. The push for modernization and reliability will favor certain sectors over others. Here’s what to watch: ### Behind-the-Meter Solutions and Companies As the centralized grid falters, decentralized “behind-the-meter” technologies—such as battery storage, microgrids, and rooftop solar—are gaining traction. These solutions allow businesses and households to generate and store power independently, reducing reliance on the main grid. Companies like Fluence Energy, Stem Inc., and Tesla Energy are poised for growth, with demand surging for their storage systems to handle peak loads from data centers and EVs. The Department of Energy (DOE) is allocating $32 million in 2025 for smart EV charging and distributed energy integration, signaling federal support. Investors should eye firms innovating in energy management software and modular storage, as these could see explosive adoption in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, which handles 70% of global internet traffic. ### Natural Gas and Oil Companies Reliability is king in a strained grid, and fossil fuels still provide the backbone. With coal plants retiring (e.g., Utah’s 1,800 MW Intermountain Power Project), natural gas and oil are stepping in as “bridge” fuels. The DOE has delayed retirements of coal and gas plants to avert shortages. Natural gas firms benefit from their flexibility and lower emissions profile compared to coal, while oil companies could see upticks in backup generation demand. Look for integrated energy giants with strong midstream assets, as they can capitalize on rising wholesale prices in deregulated markets like Texas and Arizona, where cooling demands are surging. Grid UtilitiesTraditional utilities are investing heavily to shore up the system. The DOE aims to boost long-distance transmission capacity by 16% by 2030 through 7,500 miles of new lines. Companies like NextEra Energy, Dominion Energy, and Avangrid are leading the charge—Avangrid, for instance, plans $20 billion in investments across 23 states through 2030. These regulated utilities offer stable dividends and exposure to rate hikes as costs pass through to consumers. Independent power producers like NRG Energy are also attractive, profiting from elevated wholesale electricity prices amid supply constraints. In summary, a diversified approach makes sense: behind-the-meter for growth potential, natural gas/oil for reliability plays, and utilities for steady returns. However, risks like regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions loom large—focus on companies with strong balance sheets and innovation pipelines. ### How Consumers Will Feel the Pinch The grid’s woes will hit consumers hardest through higher bills and unreliable service. As utilities pass on upgrade costs, residential electricity prices are climbing nationwide—up about 6.5% from May 2024 to May 2025. Blackouts could become more frequent, disrupting daily life, work, and safety, especially in vulnerable areas prone to weather extremes. The impact varies by state, with some already facing exorbitant rates due to reliance on imported fuels, geography, or high demand. Below is a table of the top 10 most expensive states for residential electricity, based on EIA data for June 2025 (in cents per kWh). These states, often coastal or isolated, illustrate the uneven burden. Consumers in these states could see monthly bills exceed $200 for average usage, prompting shifts toward energy efficiency, solar adoption, or even relocation. Nationally, a Microsoft and Google-backed report warns of a shortage of 500,000 electricians in the next decade, further delaying home upgrades and EV installations. ### Looking Ahead: A Call for Action America’s grid crisis demands urgent investment and policy reform to avert catastrophe. While challenges mount, they also herald a transformation toward a smarter, more resilient energy system. Investors who position themselves wisely—balancing innovation with reliability—stand to benefit, but only if policymakers act swiftly. For consumers, the message is clear: prepare for higher costs and potential disruptions by exploring personal energy solutions today. ## [Avoid Paying Taxes in 2025](https://energynewsbeat.co/investinoil/) [Crude Oil, LNG, Jet Fuel price quote](http://energynewsbeat.co/tradingdesk/) [ENB Top News](http://energynewsbeat.co/top-news/)[ENB](http://energynewsbeat.co/) [Energy Dashboard](https://dashboard.energynewsbeat.com/?_gl=1*ij4iab*_ga*NTEyODgzNzk5LjE3MjM3Mzk2NjU.*_ga_JDVH4V200Q*MTcyNTU2OTQ3MC4xMzMxLjEuMTcyNTU2OTQ5Ny4zMy4wLjA.)

On May 10, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after a series of retaliatory strikes and cross-border clashes triggered by a deadly militant attack on April 22 in India-administered Kashmir, which New Delhi claims was carried out by an alleged Pakistan-backed militant group. Following the ceasefire, India and Pakistan's military leaders held a phone call on May 12 to discuss de-escalation. Later, on May 30, a senior Pakistani military official stated that the two countries were close to reaching an agreement to reduce troop deployments along the border to pre-conflict levels, though no such drawdown has yet been observed....",

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

[Doomberg](https://substack.com/@doomberg) Sep 28, 2025 ∙ Paid 663 [122](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/energy-bind/comments) 22 [Share](javascript:void(0)) _“You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that \\[is\\] it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.”_ – Rahm Emanuel One of the great mysteries of our time is why so few media outlets or geopolitical analysts incorporate energy as a core input to their explanations of contemporary events and predictions of the future. While no single parameter is all-encompassing, energy is among the most powerful, and exploring where significant oil and gas resources and infrastructure exist often yields useful insights that defy consensus. Consider Argentina. As early as September 10th, we [postulated](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/mosaic-theory) that the US might be tempted to bail out the country, largely because it is home to one of the largest and most exciting shale oil and gas plays in the world: > “ _The Trump administration may feel compelled to mount a rearguard action in Argentina on behalf of loyal ally President Javier Milei, whose political party was roundly defeated in local elections over the weekend. Although the results do not directly impact his standing at the federal level, the electoral setback is spooking markets just as oil and gas production in the country’s massive Vaca Muerta shale resource is taking off. The country’s bonds and currency both plunged on the news._” Less than two weeks later, [things evolved](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/politics/us-argentina-bessent-javier-milei.html) as we anticipated: > “ _The Trump administration pledged on Monday to do whatever is necessary to support Argentina’s struggling economy, throwing a lifeline to the country’s embattled president, Javier Milei, ahead of legislative elections there next month._ > > _Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the United States is prepared to offer loans to Argentina’s central bank, direct currency purchases and purchases of U.S. dollar-denominated Argentine government debt from Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund to keep Argentina’s economy afloat. The value of Argentina’s currency, the peso, has fallen in recent weeks amid concerns about Mr. Milei’s political grip on government._” A deal in progress \\| Getty Over at CNN, the news unsurprisingly was framed through the lens of raw partisan politics. In an analysis titled “ [The Argentina bailout is all about propping up a Trump ally](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/business/argentina-bailout-trump-milei),” the words “oil,” “gas,” and “Vaca Muerta” don’t even merit an appearance. Instead, it all comes down to ideology: > “ _The US’s sudden love for Argentina’s economy ‘doesn’t make any sense from a realist, strategic perspective,’ Nate Schenkkan, an independent international relations expert, said in an interview. ‘This kind of stuff only really makes sense within an ideological framework.’_” If one eschews Mr. Schenkkan’s ideological framework and turns instead to brute physics and finance, the potential for significant deals to be struck between Argentina and the Trump administration appears clear. If we are right, the impact on geopolitics and energy will be substantial. Let’s make a few predictions based on the pattern of evidence. ## This post is for paid subscribers [Subscribe](https://newsletter.doomberg.com/subscribe?simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter.doomberg.com%2Fp%2Fenergy-bind%3Futm_source%3D%252Finbox%26utm_medium%3Dreader2&utm_source=paywall&utm_medium=web&utm_content=174682665) [Already a paid subscriber? **Sign in**](https://substack.com/sign-in?redirect=%2Fp%2Fenergy-bind%3Futm_source%3D%252Finbox%26utm_medium%3Dreader2&for_pub=doomberg&change_user=false) PreviousNext",

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

In October, the South China Morning Post reported that China had revived plans to build a 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) tunnel to divert water to Xinjiang province from the Yarlung Tsangpo River in southern Tibet and was testing the technique on a separate tunnel project. China denied that any such plans were underway. But when the Sang River then appeared muddier than normal in recent weeks and displayed elevated levels of iron, it struck a nerve in India. A local leader running for office in Arunachal Pradesh speculated that Chinese construction was responsible for the pollution, but he failed to provide evidence to back up his assertion and both Indian and Chinese leaders denied that China was responsible for the muddy waters. On Dec. 4, Indian Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said an earthquake that took place...

    "title": "Donald Trump tariffs news live updates: India offers zero-for-zero tariffs on auto parts, steel from US",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "India offers zero-for-zero tariffs on auto parts, steel from US: Report India has put forward a proposal for reciprocal zero tariffs on specific industrial goods, including steel, auto parts and pharmaceuticals, up to a predetermined import volume in its trade talks with the US, sources with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg. Once imports exceed the specified threshold, standard duty rates would apply to these industrial products, according to the sources who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the discussions. Indian trade representatives made this proposal during their visit to Washington in the previous month, aiming to accelerate discussions for a bilateral trade agreement anticipated by autumn this year. Both countries are focusing on select industries to achieve a swift trade agreement before the conclusion of the 90-day suspension of President Donald Trump's retaliatory tariffs, the sources revealed. During an interactive discussion at Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs in the US, Rahul Gandhi commented on the Indian government's stance regarding President Donald Trump's tariff decision, saying, \"We don't know how is it responding because they (the government) don't tell us these things.\" Donald Trump is negotiating, and he is well within his rights to negotiate, Gandhi said, adding that \"we should negotiate right back.\" \"We should understand what our strengths are, (and) what we need, and we should not compromise in areas that are detrimental to us. He (Trump) is well within his rights to say that he wants to change the tariff structure, and it's a negotiation; it's fine. I think we are more than capable enough to negotiate ourselves a decent deal,\" he said. The US and India need to show how they can produce effectively in a democratic environment, he added. Victorious Australian PM holds 'warm' chat with Trump Australia's prime minister said Monday he held a \"warm\" conversation with Donald Trump, days after storming to an election victory partly shaped by voters' distrust of the US president. Left-leaning Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won by a landslide on Saturday, defeating a conservative challenger pilloried by critics for his \"Trump-lite\" policy offerings. \"I had a warm and positive conversation with President Donald Trump just a short while ago,\" Labor Party leader Albanese told reporters. \"It was a very warm discussion about the friendship between our two nations that's so important. \"He was fully aware of the outcome and he expressed the desire to continue to work with me in the future,\" he added, referencing his election win. The conversation touched on the nations' security alliance, Albanese said, as well as the rollout of punishing US tariffs. Trump's trade tariffs, and the chaos they unleashed, were far from the only factor in the Labor Party's resounding victory -- but analysts said they certainly helped. Albanese's slow-but-steady leadership resonated at a time of global tumult, analysts said, with voters deserting hard-nosed conservative leader Peter Dutton in droves. The harshest critics likened Dutton's offering to that of a \"Temu Trump\", an unflattering comparison to the popular website offering cut-price unbranded goods. Albanese also confirmed the first trip of his second term would be to neighbouring Indonesia. US Federal Reserve likely to defy Trump, keep rates unchanged this week The Federal Reserve will likely keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, despite weeks of harsh criticism and demands from President Donald Trump that the Fed reduce borrowing costs. After causing a sharp drop in financial markets two weeks ago by saying he could fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump subsequently backed off and said he had no intention of doing so. Still, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said the Fed should cut rates. They argue that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked. Separately, Elon Musk, the head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, last Wednesday suggested that DOGE should look more closely at the Fed's spending on its facilities. The heightened scrutiny shows that even as the Trump administration backs off its threats to fire Powell, the Fed is still subject to unusually sharp political pressures, despite its status as an independent agency. Trump's trade demands go beyond tariffs to target perceived unfair practices The Trump administration says the sweeping tariffs it unveiled April 2, then postponed for 90 days, have a simple goal: Force other countries to drop their trade barriers to U.S. goods. Yet President Donald Trump’s definition of trade barriers includes a slew of issues well beyond the tariffs other countries impose on the U.S., including some areas not normally associated with trade disputes. Those include agricultural safety requirements, tax systems, currency exchange rates, product standards, legal requirements, and red tape at the border. He’s given countries three months to come up with concessions before tariffs ranging from 10% to more than 50% go into effect. Tariffs on China are already in effect. On many issues it will be difficult, or in some cases impossible, for many countries to make a deal and lower their tariff rates. In addition, many trade officials from targeted countries say privately that it isn’t always clear what the Trump administration wants from them in the negotiations. Vice President JD Vance announced that India has agreed to the terms of trade talks with the United States, but other countries are still trying to set the contours for any negotiations. The White House has highlighted conflicting goals for its import taxes: It’s seeking to raise revenues and bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but it also wants greater access to foreign markets and massive changes to other nations’ tax and regulatory policies. Trump imposing 100% tariff on imported films may encourage Hollywood to move out of US: Shekhar Kapur Filmmaker Shekhar Kapur on Monday criticised American President Donald Trump for threatening a 100 percent tariff on films imported to the US, saying the move could backfire and instead push Hollywood filmmakers to leave the country. In a post Sunday night on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he has authorised the Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative to slap a 100 per cent tariff \"on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands\". Kapur, known for films such as \"Mr India\", the \"Elizabeth\" franchise starring Cate Blanchett and \"What's Love Got to Do with It?\", said over \"75% of box office\" of Hollywood films comes from outside the US. \"And significant part of the budget of those films are spent outside the US. President Trump's imposition of 100% tarif on all films imported into the US may encourage Hollywood to move outside the US! Quite the opposite of what he intended. #Hollywood #tarrif #DonaldTrump #tarrifonfilm (sic)\" the director wrote on X. EVs pose threat to manufacturers of engine components, but also open opportunities in advanced tech: Report The ongoing transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to reshape the auto component industry by increasing content per vehicle and creating new avenues for suppliers, according to a recent report by Ambit Capital. However, it also highlighted that while the rise of EVs poses a threat to manufacturers dependent on internal combustion engine (ICE) components, it also unlocks significant growth opportunities. The report said \"While EV disruption poses existential risk for the suppliers of ICE-dependent components, it opens up several opportunities for the component suppliers to provide a) EV components like li-ion batteries, traction motors, controllers, BMS etc\" It added that the component makers can diversify into EV-specific parts such as lithium-ion batteries, traction motors, controllers, and battery management systems (BMS). Additionally, EVs enable the adoption of advanced technologies like regenerative braking, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and smart cockpits, further boosting the role of suppliers in the value chain. Donald Trump tariffs news live updates: Trump says ordering '100% tariff' on all movies produced abroad President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being \"devastated\" by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad. \"I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Donald Trump tariffs news live updates: Trump claims credit for 'good parts' of economy, blames Biden for rest Donald Trump said in an interview on Sunday that the \"good parts\" of today's US economy flow from his policies while the bad can be blamed on his predecessor Joe Biden, who \"did a terrible job.\" \"Ultimately, I take responsibility for everything,\" the US president said in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" talk show. \"But I've only just been here for a little more than three months.\" At a time of mixed economic signals and mounting concerns over his aggressive use of tariffs, Trump said \"certain aspects\" of the economy are his doing. \"I was able to get down the costs,\" he said. \"I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he's done a terrible job.\" While surveys point to growing public concern over the economy, most official indicators are not yet flashing red, with unemployment last month at a moderate 4.2 percent and inflation in March at 2.3 percent, just above the Federal Reserve's target. Donald Trump tariffs news live updates: How the stock market made back all its losses after Trump escalated the trade war It felt much longer, but the U.S. stock market needed just a few weeks to roar all the way back to where it was on President Donald Trump's “Liberation Day.” That's when he shocked Wall Street by announcing much steeper tariffs than expected on nearly all U.S. trading partners. Those tariffs unveiled on April 2 were so severe that they raised fears Trump did not worry about causing a recession in his attempt to reshape the global economy. Within just four days, the S&amp;P 500 fell about 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 4,600 points, or about 11%. This past Friday, though, the S&amp;P 500 rallied 1.5% for a ninth straight gain and pulled back to where it was on April 2. Of course, the index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts is still more than 7% below its all-time high set earlier this year. And stocks could easily fall again as uncertainty remains high about what Trump's tariffs will ultimately do to the economy. But the run for U.S. stocks back upward has been just as wild and unexpected as its fall. Donald Trump tariffs news live updates: Trump says 'I don't know' if must uphold US Constitution as president US President Donald Trump said in remarks airing Sunday that he does not know whether he must uphold the US Constitution, the nation's founding legal document. In a wide-ranging NBC News interview, the 78-year-old Republican also said he was not seriously considering running for a constitutionally-barred third White House term, and blamed his presidential predecessor Joe Biden for the \"bad parts\" of the current economy. Trump has drawn widespread criticism for repeatedly brushing up against constitutional guardrails since returning to the White House in January, notably over his policy of mass deportations of undocumented migrants, some without the benefit of a court hearing. He insists such rapid expulsions are necessary in the face of what he has declared to be a \"national emergency,\" and that giving every migrant a court trial would take \"300 years.\" When NBC's \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker asked if people in the United States -- citizens and non-citizens alike -- deserve the due process of law, as the US Constitution states, Trump said: \"I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.\" Pressed more generally on whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land, Trump repeated: \"I don't know.\" The remarks in the interview -- recorded Friday and broadcast Sunday -- quickly made waves in Washington, including among some Republicans.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(YURI CORTEZ/AFP via Getty Images) In early fall, we examined the implications of increasing energy prices, including their potential to generate social unrest. Since then, many countries have witnessed more generalized inflation -- which is causing prices to rise for a variety of essentials, not just the energy that consumers pay to heat their homes, cook their food and drive their cars -- suggesting that unrest risks are expanding as more countries and more items are affected. As concerns grow that inflationary pressures will persist long into 2022 it is worth examining what countries may be most vulnerable to inflation-driven unrest and how it could play out. To do so, looking back at previous episodes of unrest linked to price rises can help evaluate what could happen in the coming year....

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Thus far, only sporadic violent plots and a few low-level attacks have targeted AI infrastructure like data centers. For the most part, pushback has taken the form of rhetoric and some nonviolent protests. The muted response reflects the fact that, for now, AI has yet to significantly demonstrate the type of grand promises or perils forecast by its dreamers or doomsdayers. This will not last. As AI ripples across societies and workplaces, upending daily life, labor markets and politics, the upheaval will inevitably spark backlash -- and at least some of the aggrieved will resort to violence.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=China%E2%80%99s+Great+Firewall+Now+Orbits+Earth %0A%0A https://stratnewsglobal.com/china/chinas-great-firewall-now-orbits-earth/) China has taken its model of digital control beyond Earth’s atmosphere with the launch of the world’s first prototype “Satellite Internet Firewall,” a development that rights advocates say represents the extension of Beijing’s Great Firewall into orbit. According to Human Rights in China (HRIC), a New York-based nongovernmental organization founded in 1989, the payload was launched on September 5, 2025, aboard a Ceres-1 (Yao-15) carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The project was developed by the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and integrates a mix of artificial intelligence, anomaly detection, on-board inspection, autonomous decision-making, and even “intelligent deception” designed to mislead potential attackers. HRIC described the launch as a milestone in China’s vision of cyber-sovereignty, with far-reaching implications for both national security and global internet governance. “By embedding censorship, surveillance logic, and active defense techniques directly into space infrastructure, China is shaping the rules of the satellite internet race in ways that challenge open-network models such as Starlink,” the group said. In a detailed account, Beiyou News, the university’s news platform, reported that the firewall payload was one of three satellites launched on September 5. The “Satellite Internet Firewall” was independently developed by the National Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications at BUPT, under the leadership of Professors Zhao Yongli and Zhang Jie, and guided by Academician Guo Shize. Beiyou News said the project marked “a historic step forward” for China in satellite internet security, describing it as the world’s first multi-dimensional integrated security payload capable of protecting both the physical and network layers of satellite internet systems. The payload integrates several advanced technologies: - Multi-dimensional rule engine for filtering and detection. - AI-powered abnormal behavior sensing to detect suspicious activity. - Onboard inspections conducted in real time. - Large-scale autonomous decision-making models capable of running 14-billion-parameter optimization tasks. - Intelligent trapping mechanisms designed to lure and study attackers. This combination allows the satellite to detect and block cyberattacks in real time, safeguarding critical business and government communications. The system reportedly has the capacity to manage traffic at 10 Gbps concurrency, with more than 70,000 threat detection rules embedded. The firewall is designed to act as the first line of defense for satellite-to-ground and intersatellite communications. By providing onboard computing power and a real-time defense orchestration environment, the payload creates what Beiyou News called “an in-orbit firewall” that protects against high-volume and sudden traffic surges. The system also conducts automatic health checks of satellite ports and key services every minute, ensuring constant monitoring and protection. By linking network-layer threat detection with physical-layer monitoring, the firewall establishes a closed-loop defense mechanism. Beiyou News emphasized that the payload represented “a comprehensive improvement” of China’s satellite internet security capabilities, blending artificial intelligence and cybersecurity technologies into a lightweight but powerful defense system. HRIC warned that the satellite firewall extends the reach of China’s censorship and surveillance regime. Unlike traditional ground-based systems, which operate within national borders, the deployment of firewalls in orbit could impact global information flows, especially if China offers “secure” satellite internet to partner states under its Belt and Road Initiative or other strategic frameworks. “Who gets to decide what information flows freely in orbit?” HRIC asked in its analysis. The group argued that embedding such technology into the very infrastructure of space networks could consolidate Beijing’s control over not only its own population but also foreign users who depend on Chinese satellite services. The rights organization also highlighted the potential conflict between China’s satellite firewall and open-network systems like SpaceX’s Starlink, which are premised on unrestricted access to the internet. The deployment of censorship logic in orbit, HRIC said, could reshape competition in the satellite internet sector by making “secure but restricted” services an exportable model. For Beijing, the launch signals both a scientific breakthrough and a political statement. The successful development of the prototype firewall demonstrates China’s ability to integrate artificial intelligence into space-based cybersecurity systems despite limited onboard resources. It also reflects the government’s long-standing goal of fusing technological advancement with national security priorities. Beiyou News noted that the project was achieved after “repeated program demonstrations, technical breakthroughs, and payload optimization.” The team overcame challenges such as limited computing power in space and the need for real-time intelligent decision-making. The news outlet described the achievement as supporting China’s mission of “serving national needs, targeting international frontiers, focusing on scientific and technological innovation, and supporting major scientific and technological projects and national security needs.” HRIC underscored the symbolic dimension of the launch: the export of the “Great Firewall” from terrestrial networks to orbital systems. What began in the 1990s as a domestic mechanism for controlling access to foreign websites has now, with the September 5 launch, reached beyond Earth’s atmosphere. By moving censorship into orbit, China is positioning itself not just as a global power in space technology but as a rule-setter in the future governance of the satellite internet. As HRIC noted, “This is a milestone in China’s vision of extending cyber-sovereignty into orbit.” ##### [Ramananda Sengupta](https://stratnewsglobal.com/author/ramananda-sengupta/) [\\+ postsBio ⮌](https://stratnewsglobal.com/stratnewsglobal.com) In a career spanning three decades and counting, Ramananda (Ram to his friends) has been the foreign editor of The Telegraph, Outlook Magazine and the New Indian Express.

This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply.

(BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity to lay aside, however briefly, their countries' long-standing differences and focus on topics of mutual concern, such as climate change, food security and natural disasters. Yet one related issue was missing from the agenda: water. If Beijing and New Delhi fail to address the matter, the repercussions for the region, its inhabitants and its environment will likely be devastating....

On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations.

Washington cited New Delhi's failure to provide \"equitable and reasonable access\" to its trade markets, while implying that the program -- which was put in place in 1975 to boost U.S. trade with developing countries -- was outdated and no longer useful. India had been the largest beneficiary of the GSP, with $6.3 billion of its goods eligible for preferential duties under the program in 2018. New Delhi has since downplayed the U.S. decision, saying that such economic concerns were simply a part of any international relationship that \"get resolved mutually from time to time.\" Should the White House follow up with a 301 investigation (which is the legal tool it has used to hike tariffs against Chinese exports), there's a chance Washington could start imposing tariffs against a wider...

Prasit Photo \\| Moment \\| Getty Images Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that “reciprocal” tariffs, first announced in April, will take effect on Aug. 1 for countries that haven’t struck a deal. Trump added in a separate announcement Sunday that an [additional 10% tariff](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/07/trump-says-countries-aligning-with-brics-bloc-will-face-extra-tariff.html) would be charged to countries “aligning themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS” without elaborating. His announcement came as the BRICS bloc of developing countries gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for a two-day summit. Earlier on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that [tariffs introduced in April will be enforced starting August 1](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/06/bessent-tarrifs-trump-august.html) for countries that haven’t finalized an agreement with the Trump administration. While Bessent dismissed the notion that August 1 represents a fresh deadline, he acknowledged that the new date could allow trading partners additional time to renegotiate tariff terms. Japan’s benchmark [Nikkei 225](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.N225/) slipped 0.56% to close at 39,587.68 while the Topix declined 0.57% to close at 2,811.72.

Hong Kong’s [Hang Seng index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.HSI/) lost 0.61%, and mainland China’s CSI 300 dipped 0.43% to 3,965.17. The Reserve Bank of Australia kicks start its two-day meeting, where it is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points to 3.60%. U.S. stock futures fell after Trump confirmed that tariffs are set to go into effect Aug. 1, not July 9. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 146 points, or 0.32%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.39% and 0.42%, respectively. Last Friday stateside, the three major averages closed higher. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) and [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) powered to new highs and capped off a winning week as banking behemoths ushered in a promising start to the third-quarter earnings season.

[Data from Japan’s ministry of health, labor and welfare](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/database/db-l/r07/2505pe/2505pe.html) revealed that real wages fell 2.9% in May compared to the year before. This was sharper than the revised 2% decline in April and marked its fifth straight month of decline. The ministry’s data shows that nominal wages have risen every month from December 2021. _—Lim Hui Jie_ ## Private credit’s trillion-dollar boom is fueling warnings of a hidden financial contagion Private credit has swiftly emerged as one of the hottest corners of global finance, and its rapid rise is prompting alarm bells. It comes as no surprise that industry observers are saying private credit could become a locus of contagion in the next financial crisis, said Shihan Abeyguna, Morningstar’s Southeast Asia managing director. According to PitchBook data, the private debt industry is sitting on $566.8 billion worth of funds ready for deployment— a historic level of dry powder. Fund managers are incentivized to lend quickly and put them to work, as one cannot collect fees on cash that is lying around, added Abeyguna. “If this becomes reality, then managers may find themselves lowering lending standards in a bid to lend more money, which leads to a higher default risk,” he told CNBC.

ANZ economists forecast that the RBA will cut its cash rate by 25 basis points in the July and August meetings given the “overall resilience” in Australia’s economy and ongoing tightness in the country’s labor market. Similarly, Commonwealth Bank of Australia sees a 25 basis points cut, and believes a 50 basis points reduction is not on the table given the “less uncertain global environment” relative to May. _—Lee Ying Shan_ ## Trump says countries aligning with BRICS policies will face additional 10% tariff U.S. President Donald Trump announced that an additional 10% tariff will be charged to countries “aligning themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS,” without elaborating. “Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff.

Nathan Howard \\| Reuters U.S. President Donald Trump and high-ranking Cabinet officials confirmed that tariffs will go into effect Aug. 1, not July 9. Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were asked in an interview with pool reporters Sunday to clarify when the new higher tariffs rates will be implemented. Lutnick responded, “Tariffs go into effect Aug. 1. But the president is setting the rates, and the deals, right now.” Trump assented with the statement. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [said in an interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/06/bessent-tarrifs-trump-august.html) on CNN’s “State of the Union” that tariffs announced back in April will go into effect on Aug. 1 for those countries that have yet to reach an agreement with the U.S. He said duties will “boomerang” back to higher April 2 levels if there is no progress. As of Sunday, Trump’s April 9 [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-to-reflect-trading-partner-retaliation-and-alignment/) which established the July 9 tariff implementation date did not appear to have been formally revised. While the president has broad tariff powers, the April 9 order would typically be replaced with a new order establishing the Aug. 1 date. The White House did not immediately reply to a question from CNBC about whether the president planned to issue a new executive order before July 9. _— Sarah Min_",
