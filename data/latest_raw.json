[Articles](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/recent) **Red Salute: India’s Maoist Maelstrom and Evolving Counterinsurgency Doctrines** Sajid Farid Shapoo > “ _One Mahsud tribesman aptly described to me their tactics as being like that of the hawk. The hawk flies high in the sky, out of danger; he flies round and round until he sees his prey and then he swoops down on it for one mighty strike and when he has got his prey, he does not wait around, he flies off at once to some far off quiet place where he can enjoy what he has got_ [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn1).” It was a usual summer afternoon in the dense tropical forests of Jheeram Ghati (valley) of Darbha Division in Chhattisgarh; hot and humid with thick canopy of trees blocking the sunlight, making it appear already like dusk\\*. Kiran, along with his other comrades had been sitting on an ambush site for the last seven days. Just a day ago they had received information about some senior members of Indian National Congress, a prominent political party, who would be travelling through Darbha, on their way back from electioneering. The Maoists usually avoid targeting political leaders unless directed by top leadership, the Central Committee. But one name would drive Kiran and his comrades to take matters in their own hand and launch an attack. The name was Mahendra Karma, a former minister in Chhattisgarh Government and the founder of Salwa Judum. Salwa Judum was a pro state, tribal auxiliary defense militia, which few years ago, had become an important part of state’s COIN strategy and tactics. Salwa Judum meaning ‘Purification hunt’ was raised by Mahendra Karma in 2005 by drawing in local tribal youths and surrendered Maoists. Their arrival on the COIN scenario was seen by many as a game changer and the tide had started to turn against the Maoist. There were however large scale accusations of murders, rapes and extortion of local tribals by the Salwa Judum members [\\[ii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn2). A view upheld by Supreme Court of India, when it banned the Salwa Judum in 2011. [\\[iii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn3) Though the ambush as a part of annual ‘Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign’ of Communist Party of India (Maoist) was originally planned to attack the security forces, the opportunity to target Mahendra Karma, was enough for Maoists to quickly recalibrate their strategy [\\[iv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn4). On May 25th 2013, Kiran and his comrades attacked the convoy killing around 28 people including Mahendra Karma. To the surprise of Maoists there were other senior party leaders also in the convoy, including Nand Kumar Patel, former Home Minister of Chhattisgarh and Vidya Charan Shukla former union minister, all of whom were killed in the attack. The attack was perhaps the single most devastating strike that Maoists had carried out against political leaders, killing almost the entire top brass of Congress leadership in Chhattisgarh [\\[v\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn5). The attack was carried by skillful use of guerrilla tactic, first by initiating IED blasts to blow the front vehicles. Once the convoy was immobilized, the insurgents swooped down from the nearby hills firing at the convoy. None amongst the two dozen security personnel accompanying the convoy could react or was given a chance to react [\\[vi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn6). The Darbha attack, as it was revealed later, was not a pre planned attack on the political leadership. The opportunity to strike at Mahendra Karma, led to a quick yet successful recalibration of the strategy. The attack was planned and executed by the local Darbha Division of the CPI (Maoist). There were around 40 to 50 insurgents aided by around 100 men and women belonging to local tribal militia [\\[vii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn7). After the attack the insurgents like true guerrilla hawks quickly retreated back into the jungles and left the area. The members of the militia went back to their daily routine. The attack again reinforced certain key strengths of the insurgents which include i) robust and efficient intelligence network ii) devolution of authority to the local committees iii) ability to quickly readjust their strategy iv) extensive support from local tribes and ability to organize them into tribal militia for short term tactical purposes and v) domination of local landscape. The Darbha attack was an appropriate reminder of why the Maoist insurgency has repeatedly been called India’s biggest internal security challenge [\\[viii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn8). This paper is an attempt to understand this very challenge. The paper intends to trace back the origins of Maoist movements in India which would help in putting the current stream of insurgency in perspective. This is followed by understanding the current insurgency with its strategy and tactics. Besides delving deep into the COIN strategies adopted by Indian security forces and the raging debates about it, I have also made an attempt to analyze a success model in the form of Andhra Pradesh’s COIN campaign. I have concluded with a brief analysis of the problem. **Guerrilla on the Scene: History of Maoism in India** The early Maoist hawks emerged around the same time when Mehsud tribes were hunting their prey in Kashmir. The initial Maoist strands can be traced back to a peasant rebellion in Telegana in the erstwhile Nizam state of Hyderabad in 1947.In April 1948, a dissident faction of the Communist Party of India (CPI) was responsible for organizing the peasants in the Telangana region and adopted Maoism as both its goal and strategy [\\[ix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn9). The Telangana movement was a result of acute agrarian stress caused by exploitation of poor peasants and tribals by the landlords (Jagirdars and deshmukhs). The peasants and tribals were perpetually in debt and many committed suicides when the harassment of Jagirdars and Deshmuks became intolerable [\\[x\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn10). This movement laid down the framework of principals and strategies which the future communist insurgencies would also adopt. The CPI, in 1950, laid down the principles insurgency in India which I will discuss later in the paper. Suffice to say that Indian communists very early in their struggle had adopted the Mao’s idealogy of ‘People’s War’ as their mode of struggle. There was widespread violence both by the rebels and the state. The movement resulted in deaths of thousands of tribals and peasants. This movement ended in early fifties partly as a result of strong government action and also the decision of CPI to take part in the first electoral process of the independent India [\\[xi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn11). **_Naxalbari Rebellion_** In 1967, Communist Party of India (Maoist Leninst) headed by Charu Majumdar, took the cause of agricultural laborers and sharecroppers against the repressive policies of ‘Jotedars’ (nonagricultural landlords) and started an armed insurgency in Naxalbari district of West Bengal. The widespread ideological appeal of the Naxalbari movement, is the reason, why the name ‘Naxal’ has survived till today and is commonly used in addressing the Maoist insurgents. The exploitative policies of these ‘Jotedars’ had resulted in chronic indebtedness of the share croppers and agricultural laborers. The insurgency with its growing ideological appeal soon spread to other areas including Calcutta (Kolkata) where the university students took the cause of these laborers and started an urban armed insurgency against the state government. The Naxalite movement began to spread both vertically amongst sections of students/educated middle class and horizontally across other states. There were insurgent leaders who aspired to create liberated zones and what they called ‘turning India into little Vietnams’ [\\[xii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn12).The aim was to start a prairie fire as envisaged by Mao, which would spread to entire India setting it ablaze with revolutionary war. The success of movement seemed imminent to the communists as one Chinese Newspaper reported in July 1967 “Although the course of the Indian revolutionary struggle will be long and tortuous, the Indian revolution guided by great Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong’s Thought, will surely triumph” [\\[xiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn13). How ever the aim and aspirations fell flat as insurgents failed to create a mass support for the movement. The leaders of the movement had assessed that the insurgency, in Mao’s words, would act as a spark which would set the entire prairie in flames [\\[xiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn14). The leaders of the movement failed to appreciate that the success of Mao’s movement was predicated on the support of the population. The government responded with heavy use of force. Leaders of the movement were arrested. The tactics adopted by rebels were anything but guerrilla. These minimally trained revolutionaries were no match to the government forces [\\[xv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn15). The movement was slowly marginalized and was all but crushed in 1972 by a concerted COIN campaign by West Bengal police with the help of central government. The fire had been doused but embers remained. These embers in the form of Charu’s supporters travelled to other parts of country in a bid to ignite the next prairie fire. **_Spreading Prairie Fire: Buildup to the Next Phase_** The Naxalbari movement was to inspire future generations of Indian left wing extremist. The ideology of ‘People’s war’ spread to other states. Though the Naxalbari uprising was a localized affair but it “marked an advance for the people of India as the Paris Commune had marked an advance for the world proletariat [\\[xvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn16).” Some of the comrades of Charu Mazumdar took the revolutionary ideas of Naxalbari movement with them to Telangana region in Andhra Pradesh and started mobilizing the masses for an impending struggle. These comrades realized the importance of mass mobilization, which the Naxalbari leaders had neglected. They formed a ‘Central Organizing Group’ (COG) for this purpose. Telangana had a history of left inspired struggles which started with Telangana movement of 1948. There was another communist backed peasant uprising in Srikakulam district in 1960s. In 1980 Kondapalli Seetharamaih broke away from COG and formed CPI (ML) People’s War Group (PWG). He started amass mobilization campaign which included setting up of ‘Forest Committees’ which would mobilize tribals in the jungle areas and ‘Regional Committees’ for the plains areas. By mid eighties the PWG cadres indulged in large scale violence and started targeting the government machinery. The state responded with escalating its counterinsurgency operations. The state government banned PWG in 1992. In two years more than 350 insurgents were killed and around 3000 members and sympathizers were arrested. PWG was also marred by internal strife and there was a split in the party with Kondapally Seetharamaiah being replaced by Mupalla Laxmana Rao alias Ganapathy, as general secretary. How ever the low period of the movement was not to remain for long, it would make a comeback few years later and this time more sinister than ever. Apart from Telengana , the Naxalite movement post Naxalbari had spread to other states mainly Bihar and Chattisgarh. In the state of Bihar, Maoist Coordination Committee (MCC) was the most prominent naxal group. The unique feature of naxal violence was attacks on the caste lines. Between 1987 and 1992, MCC killed more than 300 people belonging to upper castes [\\[xvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn17). MCC tried to project this caste based violence as class conflicts. It is true that in a highly stratified caste based society of Bihar, the caste invariably reflects the class but not always. What began as a fight for socioeconomic justice, degenerated into inter-caste clashes in Bihar. **_Present Phase: The Big Challenge_** During the decade of 80s and 90s, left extremist parties always tried to keep their armed component subordinate to the political wing. This had resulted in poor mobilization of armed insurgents. Rampant factionalism within the Maoists in the 90s also impacted their capability. The ‘people’s war’ could be fought only with a properly equipped People’s Liberation Army. The PWG realized this shortcoming and started laying emphasis on militarization of its armed component. The first step towards adoption of Mao’s strategy was taken by PWG in 2000 when they decided to set up a People’s Guerrilla Army. The aim was “to strengthen the political power of the people and to defeat the efforts of the State and the Central Governments to check the revolutionary movement [\\[xviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn18).” In 2004 the insurgents took a monumental decision which changed the course of Maoist insurgency in India and transformed it into India’s biggest internal security challenge. The PWG and MCC merged and formed CPI (Maoist) with Muppala Lakshman Rao alias Ganapathy as its General secretary. A year before the official announcement of the merger, the Maoists had started coming together and launching attacks on the police and security forces. The convergence of resources and efforts on one hand boosted party’s ability to mobilize the masses and on the other, it enhanced the striking capability of its armed wing. The result was quantitatively massive upsurge in the Maoist violence. In the last 12 years more than 2000 security force members have been killed [\\[xix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn19). In the year of their merger, Maoist launched one of their most daring attacks in Koraput district of Orissa. A group of 300 Maoist staged a meticulous attack on several government establishments including police stations, the district jail and the office of the Superintendent of Police. The insurgents killed about 30 people and decamped with a huge cache of arms and ammunitions. Some 1100 weapons were looted from the police armory which included AK-47s and Self Loading Rifles thus translating Mao’s idea of “state’s armory is our armory [\\[xx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn20).” The Maoist influence has gradually extended over large parts of the country. Addressing the police chiefs of the country on 15 September 2009, the Indian home minister stated that ‘Maoist ideology had its pockets of influence in 20 states across the country, and that over 2,000 police station areas in 223 districts in these states were partially or substantially affected by the menace’ [\\[xxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn21). **Biggest Internal Security Challenge: Various Dimensions** Maoist violence has spread to more than one third of the country. Government data reveals that a total of 802 members of security forces have been killed in various insurgent related incidents in last five years where as the number of insurgents killed by security forces in the same period stands at 494 [\\[xxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn22). This shows a better kill ratio in favor of insurgents. The number of civilian casualties were 2162 between 2010 and 2015. There were more than 6500 Maoist related incidents in the same period [\\[xxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn23). These are huge numbers. Adding to these grim statistics are the worrying trends of spread of the movement. Maoist activities were witnessed in 203 Districts of 20 States in 2011, the latest government figures of 2015 show Maoist incidents in more than dozen states, which does give the impression that a third of the country’s area is under some sort of Maoist influence. Apart from their traditional strongholds in Central India, Maoists are seriously involved in mobilization activities in parts of Assam, Punjab and the southern states. Maoist violence over the last decade has witnessed increased sophistication both in strategy and tactics. They have been able to upgrade their arsenal both quality and numbers. Their arms match those of counter insurgents, in fact are similar as majority of these have been looted from the state armories. One dictum of Mao, which his revolutionary followers in India have operationally translated with increasing success is that “state’s armory is our armory”. The attacks as a result have become sinister, well organized and large scale. The targets are not any more the individual class enemies, it is the state itself. The security forces have suffered heavy casualties both in numbers and looting of arms. The insurgency with its vertical and horizontal proliferation is proving to be India’s biggest internal security challenge. **Evolution of Maoist Strategy and Tactics** Very early in their evolution, the Indian communist parties recognized the appeal and applicability of Maoist doctrine to Indian settings. Mao’s ‘Protracted People War’ carried more currency than the Lenin’s urban class revolution. The present Maoist strategy is based on the doctrinal document, it released in 2004 after the creation of CPI (Maoist). The document named, _Strategy & Tactics of The Indian Revolution_ in emphasized on the efforts build a ‘people’s army’, a critical component of Mao’s “protracted people’s war” [\\[xxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn24). The protracted war, as per the document, would pass through three stages: first the ‘guerrilla warfare’, followed by ‘mobile warfare’, where the guiding principle would be “fight when you can win, retreat when you can’t” and the third stage of ‘positional warfare or the conventional war’, which would be waged face to face with the enemy. The document underlined that a ‘people’s war’ was inconceivable without a ‘people’s army’. There fore the effort of the party, says Prakash Singh, to build and develop a ‘people’s army’ was to be of vital significance in the revolutionary movement [\\[xxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn25). The armed component, People’s Guerrilla Liberation Army (PGLA) was to remain subservient to the Centre Committee(CC), the highest decision making body of CPI (Maoist). The PGLA consists of three types of forces: 1. Main Forces: These include Companies, Platoons, Special Action Teams which could move any where to participate in the war under instructions of CC. Main Forces were supposed to be better armed and include members with political consciousness and superior fighting skills. 2. Secondary Forces: These are local guerrilla squads, special guerrilla squads, division level Action Teams who will operate in a specific area and target the enemy forces. The aim was to harass and tire the enemy forces by constant attrition. 3. Base Forces: These are people’s militia which will include tribal militias, which should have the capacity to harass the enemy forces continuously. On the operational front insurgents have been quick to learn from their mistakes. During the last decade, the insurgents in order to cripple the state machinery, disrupted the train services by blowing up the tracks or by high jacking trains. Having realized that disruption of such essential services was turning public opinion against them, the insurgents in the last 5 years have generally refrained from it. The attacks on railways have dropped from 31 in 2011 to just 1 in first three months of 2016 [\\[xxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn26). **_Changing Maoist Tactics_** While guerrilla warfare in form of ambushes and other shoot and scoot methods still dominate their warfare tactics, insurgents over the years have gained considerable operational momentum across various bands of tactical spectrum. The Maoist have achieved high level of precision and sophistication in the use of IEDs and landmines. IEDs have accounted for a large chunk of security force casualty. More than 50 percent of the security force casualty is due to IEDs and landmine blasts. In a recent incident in April 2016, 7 CRPF personnel lost their lives in a landmine blast in Chhattisgarh [\\[xxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn27). The Indian official machinery has acknowledged the improvement in Maoist weaponry and operational tactics [\\[xxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn28). These improved tactics have enabled Maoists to inflicted heavy costs on the government. They have achieved some spectacular successes against security forces using an array of tactics. Maoists have indulged in deliberate attacks in the form of a) Camp Attacks b) Entrapment Tactics b) Mobile Warfare. Camp Attacks: In the last one decade Maoists have launched audacious attacks on the security force (SF) camps. Most of the attacks have been on the camps which the SFs have established deep in the Maoist territory. Though Maoists have not shied away from attacking jails and district police lines, camps in remote areas have bore the brunt of such attacks. SF camps in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand have witnessed a number of such attacks. Entrapment Tactics: Maoist have been using this novel tactic with fair amount of success. A small incident is used to lure the security forces to rush to an incident side. Any lapse in following the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) is exploited by Maoist to target the forces. In 2000, a party of 30 police personnel including an Additional Superintendent of Police were killed in Chhattisgarh when they were rushing to a site of an alleged Maoist incident. They travelled without clearance from the ‘road opening parties’ and all the members of the party were killed in a landmine blast. In May 2011, a deliberate intelligence was provided to the troops to lure them into a 4 km-stretch laid with a series of mines. Along with the simultaneous blasting of explosives, a multiple formation conventional ambush was also undertaken on the troops. Mobile Warfare: Maoist in recent passed have exhibited their ability to engage in mobile warfare. This also has been done to convey their gradual transition towards the second phase of their struggle, the ‘mobile warfare’. Multiple PGLA companies have attempted to undertake mobile warfare tactics on SFs formations. While a paramilitary contingent was encircled in Kanker in Chhattisgarh in June 2011, another para military formation was similarly attacked the same year. These resolute and bold attacks by the Maoists have showed their ability to engage the enemy on a neutral battlefield. **India’s COIN Doctrine and Strategy: Successes and Dilemmas** India has faced insurgency right from the initial years of its independence. It may be difficult to pick a year in the last 68 years, when India was not fighting insurgency in some part or some form. Indian COIN strategies have been dynamically evolving with the context and nature of the insurgency. These strategies have evoked extreme reactions. The appraisal of Indian COIN experience varies from being branded as ‘critical failure’ to one that compliments India of “never having lost an insurgency battle” [\\[xxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn29). The ‘baiters’ broadly consider ‘India’s one size fits all’ approach key to its failure [\\[xxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn30). Where as the ‘triumph’ group attributes India’s success to its resilience in handling the insurgency movements. India has been blamed for not having a focused COIN strategy against the Maoists. The experts believe the fact that Maoist insurgency for a long time didn’t threaten the Indian urban elite and was confined to remotest regions of India, explains India’s lackluster approach to this insurgency [\\[xxxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn31). It is only when the Maoists started to expand into urban centers and began targeting the political leadership, did India realize the magnitude of this ‘biggest Internal security challenge’. The efforts in countering Maoist insurgency have given a sense that the initial vacillation on part of India was responsible for the growth of Maoists from fringe entities to one directly challenging the state. The problem is still seen as more having socio economic dimensions than a security threat. Once the fruits of development, it is argued, will trickle down to the most deprived and marginalized, the raison de etre behind the Maoist struggle will vanish, thus leaving it rudderless. **_COIN Campaigns Against Maoists: Historical Perspective_** It is believed that the first wave of Counterinsurgency in Telangana outwardly adopted the classical “double pronged COIN strategy” of strong police action combined with ‘ameliorative’ development measures to win hearts and minds of local population [\\[xxxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn32). How ever it is interesting to examine that this rebellion was not even treated as an insurgency by then government. The available material indicates that the government at that time came to view this as peasant rebellion, as British Indian history witnessed many such rebellions [\\[xxxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn33).Though communist backed movement envisaged a Maoist like struggle to overthrow the powerful elite , the state response was brutal and followed the path which a COIN campaign takes. The government forces in Telangana resorted to harsh police action against the insurgents and their tribal supporters [\\[xxxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn34). In order to rob insurgents of the local support, the state government tried to forcibly relocate tribals from their forest villages into the ‘state camps’. The idea was to a) minimize the support to insurgents and b) create employment by giving them work at the new infrastructural projects which the state had started. This forcible relocation however failed in both its objectives. It is interesting to note that counterinsurgents all over the world adopt almost similar strategies to contain insurgencies. Decades later French would resort to such relocation of locals in Algeria to blunt the cross border support for FLN from Tunisia [\\[xxxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn35). Both the initiatives failed to give any fruitful results. Thousands of tribals died in Telangana as result of this relocation [\\[xxxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn36). The government also raised tribal militias in the form of ‘home guards’ and Village Defence Committees. These local militias were targeted by the insurgents and many were killed. On the other hand, members of these militias became a law unto themselves and killed many suspected insurgents in fake encounters [\\[xxxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn37). Half a century later the neighboring Chhattisgarh resorted to creation of such vigilante group in the form of Salwa Judum which was banned by SC in 2011 on the allegations of human rights excesses against the tribals. It is interested to note how the COIN efforts, despite absence of a declared doctrine, tend to follow a course which seems more like pattern. A lot of similarities in strategy and tactics can be observed when Indian COIN is compared to other COIN models across the world. Colin Jackson calls it a constraint of ‘limited marbles in a pocket”, those can only be juggled in limited number of different ways. The first phase came to end only when CPI leaders decided to participate in the first general elections after independence in 1951. **_Naxalbari COIN: A Kinetic Approach_** The Naxalbari movement was crushed by the state government with effective support from the federal government. The government decided to take on Naxalites with full force. The government launched a joint operation by the army and the police, code named Operation Steeplechase, in the bordering districts of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The strategy of the security forces was to surround as large an area as possible and seal the routes of entry and exit. The army formed the outer cordon and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) the inner ring. The local police, who were generally accompanied by a magistrate, carried out a thorough search of the area. Suspected Naxalites were arrested while illicit weapons, ammunition, and explosives were seized. Wherever possible, simultaneous action was taken in the neighboring areas thus denying Naxalites any chance to sneak out [\\[xxxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn38). The West Bengal police targeted committed student insurgents either by killing them or arresting them. The ‘fence sitters’ were promised jobs and encouraged to join politics [\\[xxxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn39). Some of the insurgents were absorbed as home guards with a monthly salary. These ‘home guards’ acted as valuable informers by identifying other insurgents. By the end of 1972, almost all the top Naxalite leaders including Charu Majumdar and several others were arrested by the police. Around 8000 naxal members and sympathizers were arrested. The poverty alleviation schemes of both centre and state governments also veered away sizeable section of rural population away from the insurgents. Many experts believe that state’s extensive and violent measures brought an end to Naxalbari movement [\\[xl\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn40). How ever the inability of state to wipe out the remaining traces resulted in insurgents moving to other states and with them travelled the idea of Maoism. **Present COIN Strategy: Kinetic Redux ?** The Government of India essentially treats Maoist insurgency as a ‘Law and Order’ problem which falls under the purview of Police and Public order [\\[xli\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn41). Police and Public order being ‘state subjects’ in Indian constitution, entails that the primary responsibility of handling Maoist insurgency rests with the individual states. The center can extend assistance in the form of providing financial resources and deploying Central Armed Police Forces, which would essentially be in aid to state efforts. The government website lays down its approach to Maoist insurgency as holistic which involves improving security situation, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities, improvement in governanace and public perception system [\\[xlii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn42). A first look at governments stated strategy seems to be a population centric of ‘winning hearts and minds’ but the ground situation reveals a different story. Various state governments have adopted their own individual strategies, choosing their own path to COIN. The current COIN strategy is state specific with support from the centre in terms of manpower and resources. The strategy translates into increasing the troops presence in the critical areas and then saturate these areas with by maximizing troops presence who then prioritize kinetic action against Maoists [\\[xliii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn43). The security forces particularly in Chhattisgarh at present are targeting the insurgents without securing the population [\\[xliv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn44). This has exposed civilian population to collateral damage and abuse during the COIN ops. Such a scenario has increased the Maoist legitimacy and given a fillip to their recruitment. There is a widespread appreciation that current patterns of insecurity dictate that stabilization must precede development. This is not an unreasonable view, it is obviously difficult to develop territory you do not control and Maoists recognize that development can erode their control. Maoists have targeted 1241 economic targets between 2011 and 2015 including roads, power plants, telephone towers, food storage [\\[xlv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn45) etc. to keep the the population insulated from the relief and developmental efforts. The government, in 2009, launched a massive stabilization cum dominance drive by deploying more than 70,000 Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) across Maoist zones in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa. This deployment popularly known as “ Operation Green Hunt”, a term coined by the media, was a step towards territorial stabilization which was to be achieved by dominating the area [\\[xlvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn46). The CRPF and state forces operate jointly forming concentric circles of responsibility. Once the area is dominated for a considerable period of time, it is believed, would lead to stability in security situation and provide opportunity for implementing developmental schemes. These ‘Clear Hold and Develop’ efforts are continuing with government pouring in more forces. **_COIN sans Special Forces_** The CRPF has a long but not very successful record of fighting insurgencies. It has been at the forefront of Maoist COIN operations. It is not a specialized COIN force and as result has suffered the maximum number of casualties in the past decade. In December 2010, Maoist ambushed a CRPF patrol in Dantewada killing 76 soldiers of the 62nd CRPF Battalion, the single largest loss of life in Indian COIN history [\\[xlvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn47). The drawbacks of deploying a non specialized COIN force in the core area of Maoist operations were evident. The attack also exposed chronic deficiencies in India’s main central forces employed to fight Maoist insurgency. Amongst the states fighting Maoist insurgency only Andhra Pradesh has a dedicated specialized COIN force, ‘Greyhounds’, created in 1989. Other states have been fighting insurgency with their regular police forces. It is only in the recent years that Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa have raised their Special Forces [\\[xlviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn48). It would take these forces some more years to reach the level of Greyhounds and much depends on the level of training and resources provided to them. While Andhra Pradesh has done well in containing its insurgent problem, other states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Bihar are struggling to overcome this tide. The escalation of threat and inability of states to raise properly trained special forces pushed Centre to raise counterinsurgency commando battalions called CoBRA (Commando Battalions for Resolute Actions). Ten Battalions of CoBRA were raised in 2009 and they have been given training in counter guerrilla tactics and Jungle Warfare at Army’s elite Jungle Warfare school in Mizoram in India [\\[xlix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn49). The Cobra battalions were deployed during Operation Green hunt. CoBRA battalions have shown better performance than other forces in taking on Maoists but their long term efficacy would be assessed in coming times. Various states have also tried to improvise on the past or existing COIN tools available to counter the insurgents. Chhattisgarh made one such improvisation in 2005, when it decided to raise an auxiliary tribal militia, Salwa Judum, to counter Maoists both militarily and ideologically. **_Salwa Judum_** Raising a local auxiliary force has been a fairly common COIN strategy. The outsourcing of security responsibilities to auxiliary non-state militias that operate with little oversight, training or accountability, has been resorted to by counterinsurgents all over the world with mixed results. The CIDG in Vietnam, the Malaya Auxillaries, the firqats in Yemen, the Ikhwanis in Kashmir have been part of such COIN strategies. Again a limited marbles syndrome. Salwa Judum “Purification Hunt” in Chhattisgarh was such an effort by the state to push war against Maoists into their own backyards. It was created in 2005 by organizing tribal youth and surrendered Maoists into well equipped vigilante auxiliary tribal militia, who would take on Maoists on their own turf [\\[l\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn50). The creation of Salwa Judum was a step towards the efforts of the state to localize their own forces. It was envisaged that a force comprising of sons of the soil would a) augment the human intelligence networks and b) provide alternative employment opportunities to the tribal youth. Salwa Judum camps were set up to provide refuge to tribal people displaced by Maoists and also act as safe zones. The idea was that Salwa Judum would act as a force multiplier and would help security forces in bridging the cultural gap between forces and the tribals. The members of Salwa Judum provided valuable information to forces. They were at times able to infiltrate Maoist ranks. As a result, government forces were able to inflict heavy losses on Maoists. How ever all this came at a heavy price. The were allegations of torture, extortion and rape against Judum members. There emerged ‘warlords’ within the judum who would vie for control of refugee camps and also the area surrounding the camps [\\[li\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn51). They at time tried to operate independently of the security forces. There were also incidents when Judum members used violence to settle their individual tribal animosities. These local militias if not supervised closely tend to operate within the zones of their own self interest and at times cross purposes with counter insurgent force. The story seems all too familiar. The tribal militia raised by British in Yemen, ‘the firqats’ started working independently fighting their own little war. The allegations of excesses on Afghan Local Police, have made their role controversial [\\[lii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn52).Salwa Judum like CIDG and Malayan tribal militias did act as a ‘force multiplier’ but it came at a substantial cost. Amidst growing allegations of torture, rape and murder, the Supreme Court of India banned Salwa Judum in 2011 [\\[liii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn53). Salwa Judum did create an unprecedented pressure on Maoists in Chhattisgarh and the latter responded by killing Judum members and their families. The allegations of excesses how ever robbed Judum of its credibility rendering an effective COIN instrument redundant. **_Indian COIN Dilemma: The Debate Rages_** There have been raging debates about the utility of different COIN models in the Indian scenario. Experts believe that Maoist insurgency posturing itself as a ‘people’s war”, mandates a more classic COIN build on the notions of competitive state building to address economic and governance deficiencies [\\[liv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn54).It requires a population centric approach of winning hearts and minds rather then a enemy centric approach of highly kinetic operations [\\[lv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn55). Some feel that India’s counterinsurgency strategy is strongly influenced by British campaign against the Malayan Communist Party [\\[lvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn56). How ever the strategy of winning ‘Hearts and Minds’ has not been at the core of Indian COIN strategy. Even Gerald Templar called “hearts and Minds” “that nauseating phrase I think I invented” [\\[lvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn57). The Indian efforts at winning hearts and minds have been put into practice only when the successes were first achieved by kinetic operations. Indian COIN efforts have invariably preferred trading “hearts and minds” approach with highly kinetic enemy centric tactics. Though insurgencies have been contained but these have not been wiped out completely. One western expert thinks that India has done tremendously well in managing the problem and not allowing them to get out of the hand [\\[lviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn58). In spite of substantial drop in insurgent violence, the insurgency is not dead in Kashmir and NE. The population in these areas still remains largely unintegrated, a drawback believed to be inherent with the highly kinetic enemy centric approach. Indian security leadership feels that an enemy centric approach is best suited for Maoist insurgency, where the fear of population seceding from India is remote. They cite the success of Andhra Pradesh in curbing the Maoist problem with enemy centric drives of kinetic operations. The success Andhra Pradesh COIN campaign without a declared COIN model has allowed experts draw their own lessons from it. Government of India also advocates that other states fighting insurgency adopt the Andhra Model [\\[lix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn59), without really explaining what this model is? **Deciphering Andhra Success** Amidst the grim Maoist landscape of India, one state seems to have charted a completely different course for itself and thus has a different story to tell. A story of success and optimism. The state of Andhra Pradesh (AP) seems to have turned the tide against the Maoists. It is today hailed as the “only success story’ in the Maoist tragedy. AP which in 90s was the hub of Maoist violence has seen a dramatic drop in Maoist related incidents. The total number incidents in 2015 dropped to just 35 as against over 500 in 2005 [\\[lx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn60). AP was the first state to raise a specialized force to deal with the Maoists. The credit for the turn around is generally given to the elite ‘Greyhound’ force, trained to live and operate in the jungle as the guerillas do, and fight the Indian jungle equivalent of a “bush war” [\\[lxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn61). Greyhound was raised in 1989 as a specialized counter Maoist force, to conduct small unit guerilla counter offensive. It is said that AP drew inspiration from the infamous Selous scouts of Rhodesia [\\[lxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn62). The force underwent rigorous training and was provided with superior equipment (particularly communications technology). It was able to rapidly deploy and effectively operate in Maoist terrain. The Greyhounds have been extremely effective, but they did not operate in isolation. Their success was possible by forging synergetic relationships with district police and intelligence agencies. The coordinated police strategies improved the intelligence sharing between the security agencies by deploying cross trained regular police units with the Greyhounds. The members of the Greyhounds were drawn from regular state police by following a strict selection process. They were given 60 percent extra salary in the form of risk allowance. They were also provided with subsidized housing, family welfare and other attractive benefits. These additional benefits ensured that Greyhounds attracted the best talent available. They operated in small units for extended periods in remote forests and hilly regions. These small units were given training in local customs and they had to learn local language. This proved to be an asset as these unit members were able to forge bonds with the tribals and villagers. These units were quite akin to “Tribal Engagement Teams” which Major Gant experimented with in Afghanistan [\\[lxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn63). The Greyhounds model is today treated as success story and other states have followed AP by raising their own specialized forces. Merely aping creation of a specialized unit may turn out to be a futile exercise unless the entire institutional environment which contributed to Greyhounds success is not replicated. The success of the Greyhounds was predicated on the robust intelligence sharing cycle between three critical units, Greyhounds, district police and Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB). The raw intelligence collected by district police was further developed by SIB and once actionable was fed to Greyhounds who would then execute it. After the execution, the information gathered in the form of seized documents and arrested insurgents, was passed back to district police and SIB for further exploiting and analyzing it. The arrest of Maoists was followed by sustained interrogation by SIB and the district police would simultaneously verify new information collected from the interrogation, on the ground. By this way the intelligence was reprocessed and again fed to Greyhounds for the next action [\\[lxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn64). While General McChrystal, the newly appointed JSOC commander in 2004, was struggling to put in place the necessary framework for implementation of his Find Fix Finish Exploit and Analyze (F3EA) strategy, another COIN special force, thousands of miles away, less equipped both technologically and militarily, was implementing his F3EA strategy with sinister precision and reaping rich dividends. It seems that Greyhounds were executing General McChrystal’s plan the way he wanted, only that the battlefield was Andhra Pradesh not Iraq and the insurgents were Maoists not Al Qaeda in Iraq. On many occasions Greyhounds acted as a ‘Direct Action” force by neutralizing top Maoists and conducting raids at Maoists hideouts. These direct actions were well coordinated actions with operational back up support from the local police and SIB [\\[lxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn65). A greater focus on the success of Greyhound (which they truly deserved) has led experts to label the AP model as an enemy centric kinetic approach. How ever this success was possible only with a well crafted community development program by the state government. The state government very early had achieved a fair understanding and appreciation of the Maoist game plan. It conceived various rural development and empowerment schemes. The focus was not on big grand projects with long gestation periods but small captive schemes which could deliver in short duration and thus have an immediate impact. The government between 2004 and2010 implemented various rural developmental schemes like ‘Remote and Internal Areas Development Projects” (RAID), small irrigation projects and health insurance schemes. These developmental initiatives undermined the ability of Maoists to recruit and mobilize new members [\\[lxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn66). At the same time government engaged with Maoists at political level. The political engagement was seen by Maoists as a recognition of the political dimension of their movement. This thaw resulted in a brief ceasefire between Maoists and Government in 2004. The ceasefire period proved to be a blessing in disguise for the state. It was successfully exploited by the police and Greyhounds by infiltrating the cadres of Maoists. For the first time in decades Maoists came out of the jungles. The police and Greyhounds were able to profile Maoists who were earlier unknown faceless entities with only aliases. Many Maoist cadres were lured towards politics and some of them joined political parties. The Government had also come up with an elaborate surrender and rehabilitation package which resulted in surrender of hundreds of Maoists. The Andhra Government based its COIN strategy on the judicious mix of enemy centric and population centric approaches [\\[lxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn67).Analysts believe that ceasefire period, though short, played an important role in turning the tide against the Maoists, when state machinery gathered extensive information about the Maoists which they later utilized with devastating effects [\\[lxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn68). The Greyhound model is viewed as an oasis of success within unsuccessful arid landscape of Maoist insurgency. Yet some experts are leery of the triumphant claims made by Andhra Pradesh as well as the potential to model the Greyhound success. These experts see enough reason to believe that the Greyhounds did not defeat the Maoist insurgents outright but merely displaced them to neighboring states. This corresponds with data that shows Maoist activity surged in neighboring Chhattisgarh as it declined in Andhra Pradesh. Second, the gains in Andhra Pradesh are still new and it is too early to conclude the demise of Maoist activity [\\[lxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn69). **Conclusion** Individual states facing insurgency had the independence of opting for the COIN strategy best suited for them. How ever the choices were made less on suitability, more on political expediency. The mobilization capacities of insurgents created perverse interests among some political parties to harness these for electoral benefits. There have been reported incidents where politician have asked Maoists to issue diktats in their favor [\\[lxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn70). Analysts believe that the extensive influence which Maoist exercise over 120 districts across 12 states is a serious blow to the internal legitimacy of Indian state. The fact that Maoist legitimacy is restricted to the most deprived sections of the society does mandate a serious thinking on part of Indian state to ameliorate the grievances of this extreme end of Indian societal scale. It is their support, though at times reluctant, which has transformed the current phase of Maoist “People’s War” as the strongest and most violent in history. States have recently started to employ serious efforts to defeat the insurgency. Every state needs to raise special forces and provide them rigorous training in ‘counter guerilla’ tactics and jungle warfare. A Maoist guerrilla can only be countered by a state guerrilla. The operating environment of these special forces has to demonstrate employment of superior tactics to defeat the insurgents. States need to synergize their efforts by launching coordinated operations thereby denying Maoists any space for maneuverability. These efforts need to be supplemented by well crafted development schemes. It is important to segregate the population from the insurgents both operationally and ideologically. The hawks and the doves need to be viewed and treated differently. The federal/central government should strive to seize strategic initiative by putting in place a well coordinated ‘hub and spoke’ kind of COIN architecture where each state acts as a critical spoke. The central government as a hub would try to harmonize the individual state interests with the overall national interest. Indian counterinsurgency has to work with a dual objective of defeating the insurgents militarily and fully quell the insurgent impulses. These would need institutional overhauls. The conflict over the distribution of resources can be mended with economic development, but the bigger challenge would be to create a system where the distribution of power is not controlled by the traditional elite. **End Notes** \\*I reached the site the same night as a part of National Investigation Agency team. \\[i\\] Khan, M Akbar (1975).

He has in-depth experience in law enforcement and counterterrorism, having supervised many important terror related investigations to include conspiracy in the Mumbai terror attacks, the Patna serial blasts, the Bodh Gaya serial blast, and many more. He is among the rare officers who have been twice conferred with the Gallantry Medal, the highest bravery award, by the President of India. He is also a recipient of the Police Medal for Meritorious Services. Sajid Shapoo is also a recognized national resource person on Al Qaeda and Lashka-e-Tayeba. He is currently pursuing his Masters in International Affairs at Columbia University , New York. ## Comments This is one of those \"National Security Issues\" that has somehow evaded the world's attention if not for the longitivtiy but for the sheer destruction caused by it. Sajid does a fantastic job of condensing this complicated topic and encompassing the essence of the struggles, failures, successes and recommendations for the way forward. Sajid's views come not just from an academic point of view but a view of a practitioner as well as someone who has been on the ground and being part of the machine that had to respond to this threat. Thank you for the wonderful writeup. The detailed and in-depth writing that starts with tracing the Indian Maoist history to the current policy decisions of the government, this is an exceedingly well researched paper. The analogy of the hawk hunting for its prey aptly sets the tone of this article - a story of the Naxalite movement in India, the tactics used by the insurgents, the COIN strategies of the Indian security forces and the analysis create a thorough understanding of the Maoist Movement in India. Given the scale of causalities suffered by both civilians and the security forces and the seeming inability to stop this covert warfare in the recent past, I have been looking to understand the genesis of this movement in India, the role of the local population and the counter by the state. This article by Sajid Shapoo, an innate storyteller, makes a technical piece of writing such as this, a valuable and enlightening read! Very informative and comprehensive",

He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOopMYRpkammY3JbuSv0VQLBVgNroFN1MwcBzigwT7ZYGZBeChO-Y#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

assistance in setting it up using our simple webchat available at: [https://wikileaks.org/talk](https://wikileaks.org/talk) If you can use Tor, but need to contact WikiLeaks for other reasons use our secured webchat available at **http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion** We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can.

In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor. #### Tails If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called [Tails](https://tails.boum.org). Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.

Please review these basic guidelines. #### 1\\. Contact us if you have specific problems If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please [contact us](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/52/5286513_stratfor-india-country-brief-nov-2-2011-.html#submit_help_contact). In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations. #### 2\\. What computer to use If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer. #### 3\\. Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

Do not talk about your submission to others If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations. #### 2\\. Act normal If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour. #### 3\\. Remove traces of your submission If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion. #### 4\\. If you face legal action If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at [https://www.couragefound.org](https://www.couragefound.org). # Submit documents to WikiLeaks WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed.

The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods. ## STRATFOR India Country Brief - Nov. 2, 2011 Released on 2012-09-03 09:00 GMT | Email-ID | 5286513 | | Date | 2011-11-02 14:49:23 | | From | Anya.Alfano@stratfor.com | | To | fred.burton@stratfor.com, Declan\\_O'Donovan@dell.com, John\\_McClurg@DELL.com, Anders\\_De\\_La\\_Motte@Dell.com, Vinod\\_Dora@Dell.com | STRATFOR India Country Brief - Nov. 2, 2011 Basic Political Developments o A day after Anna Hazare threatened to launch another hunger strike if a strong Jan Lokpal Bill was not passed in the Parliament's Winter Session, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh today said his party is not afraid of the Gandhian's threats. o CBI has called Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for questioning on November 4 in connection with alleged multi-crore iron ore mining scam. o Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, who arrived in Imphal on Wednesday on a two-day visit to Manipur, toured Naga-dominated interior Senapati hill district and appealed to people to settle all issues through dialogue.

Digvijaya said Team Anna's claim that they have the support of over one crore people on the Jan Lokpal Bill issue is \"unfounded, hollow and fictitious\". Replying to a query on 'gupt daan' (secret donations) to the NGO, India Against Corruption, run by Arvind Kejriwal during Anna's hunger strike in Delhi, Singh said sarcastically, \"Na khata na bahi, jo Kejriwal kahe wahi sahi (There is no account book.

Jagan Mohan Reddy, son of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, for questioning on November 4 in connection with alleged multi-crore iron ore mining scam. The agency is probing an alleged nexus between Mr. Jagan and Janardhana Reddy whose company Obulapuram Mining Company (OMC) has been accused of violating mining norms in the Ananthpuram district of Andhra Pradesh, CBI sources said. The clearance for mining leases to OMC was given during the tenure of Rajasekhara Reddy as Chief Minister. CBI has recently questioned the then cabinet colleagues of the late Rajasekhara Reddy in connection with the mining scam as it found that mining leases for OMC were cleared in an unusual haste, they said. Kadapa MP Jagan is also facing allegations of amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income as well as alleged dilution of stake of Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructural Corporation (APIIC) which is having a joint venture with Emaar for the development of township on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The sources said CBI has called Mr. Jagan for questioning in connection with these allegations on November 4 at the Hyderabad office of the agency. Chidambaram appeals for peace in Manipur PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591394.ece Chidambaram appeals to Manipur groups to withdraw blockade Manipur: SHDC withdraws blockade Nagas call for three-day total blockade NIA will not oppose bail of Malegaon accused: Chidambaram 48-hour bandh in hill districts of Manipur from Monday Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, who arrived in Imphal on Wednesday on a two-day visit to Manipur, toured Naga-dominated interior Senapati hill district and appealed to people to settle all issues through dialogue. Inaugurating a mini-secretariat building at Senapati district headquarters, Mr. Chidambaram said all efforts would be made to bring peace, harmony and development in the state. On October 31, Sadar Hills District Demand Committee SHDDC, which had launched economic blockades on Imphal-Dimapur -- Guwahati (NH-39) and Imphal-Jiribam-Silchar (NH-53), called off the 92-day strike after the state government assured them that their demands would be looked into. The SHDDC was demanding conversion of Kuki-dominated Sadar Hills area into Naga-majority Senapati district, Official said Mr. Chidambaram preferred to visit the interior hill district because both Nagas and Kukis there were well disposed towards the demand of the SHDDC for conversion of the Sadar Hills area into a full-fledged revenue district. Mr. Chidambaram would visit various parts of the interior hill district during his two-day visit. The minister after spending about one hour in the district visited another Naga-dominated district Ukhrul, bordering Myanmar, where he inaugurated a SDO office. Officials said he would hold a meeting with Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh to take stock of the law and order situation in Manipur. Meanwhile, the United Naga Council said it will continue its economic blockade on the two national highways on Manipur side and called a three-day bandh from midnight on Thursday to protest against the government's assurance of turning Sadar Hills area in Senapati district into a separate district. An UNC spokesman said the bandh will be supported by All Naga Students Association Manipur. He said the ongoing economic blockade on the Manipur parts of the NH 39 and NH 53 which the group had launched on August 21 would continue. He said the bandh would cover all Naga-settled areas in Manipur. Reveal names of black money account holders: Advani to govt. PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591671.ece BJP leader L.K. Advani today asked the government to make public names of those who have stashed black money abroad and sought their immediate prosecution. \"Without any further delay prosecution must be initiated and appropriate follow up action taken,\" Mr. Advani said referring to the people whose names have been provided to India by various foreign governments in this regard. \"Already there is a talk about three MPs having been identified, and the Government of France has given India a list of names of those possessing illegal wealth in Swiss and other foreign banks. The country eagerly expects their names to be made public. The UPA government will try to evade the issue once again, as has been its dismal record,\" he told reporters here. Mr. Advani said the Directorate of criminal investigation of Income Tax department had sent notices to persons involved in black money cases following scrutiny of classified banking data received from foreign countries about Swiss bank accounts. \"This is an issue on which there should be no hush hush...All information with the government on money stashed away abroad should be shared,\" he demanded. The BJP leader said, \"I have repeatedly asked for a White Paper on the issue of black money giving facts, giving names and above all giving details of all the steps taken by the government to get back this money which legitimately belongs to India. I believe that it cannot be allowed to be kept in foreign banks.\" Mr. Advani said that the American think tank \\`Global Financial Integrity' had estimated the amount of Indian black money in foreign banks at around Rs. 25 lakh crores. \"It is a staggering amount,\" he said, adding that this money should be used for the development of rural India. Government unveils bill for time-bound public services http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/government-unveils-bill-for-time-bound-public-services/articleshow/10582090.cms NEW DELHI: The government Wednesday unveiled a bill that seeks to get committed standards of public service and redressal of grievances in a stipulated time frame. The Citizens Right to Grievance Redress Bill, 2011 will look at complaints of violation of the citizens' charter to be formulated by each government department, identify liabilities of public servants in case of default and impose penalities for failure to deliver services or redress grievances in a time-bound manner. Speaking about the bill, the Minister of State for Personnel V. Narayanasamy said its architechture will ensure an appropriate decentralised and citizen-friendly mechanism to redress public grievances. \"The citizen's charter will have to be defined by the authorities at various levels, including panchayats, municipalities, states and the centre. For every authority, there will be a Grievance Redress Officer,\" Narayanasamy told mediapersons at a joint briefing with Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh. He said the bill will be put up on the website of the department of personnel for 21 days for people to give their comments. \"We will like to introduce it (the bill) in the winter session (of parliament Nov 22-Dec 21) after cabinet approval,\" he said. Narayanasamy said the bill can be enacted as a central legislation under the concurrent list and cover central schemes and central government departments. It will provide a platform to states to make a grievance redressal mechanism for state schemes and departments. Ramesh said the bill was another landmark in the \"rights-based approach followed\" by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. \"It (the) bill gives people legal entitlement,\" he said.

There is a basic thing that I want Mr Advani to know, that there is a principle of sub judice that you cannot discuss what's happening in the court,\" he told reporters here. He said if things which are before the court are discussed outside, \"there is a danger that you will influence what the courts will do.\" Khurshid was reacting to Advani's comment that if the PMO felt that then Finance Minister P Chidambaram had not taken timely measures to prevent 2G scam, the Prime Minister should have permitted a probe against him. \"It was incumbent upon the Prime Minister to permit investigation into his(Chidambaram's) role instead of expressing confidence in him saying he is innocent.\" National Economic Trends India ranked 134th in terms of Human Development Index Press Trust of India, Updated: November 02, 2011 18:45 IST http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/india-ranked-134th-in-terms-of-human-development-index-146261 New Delhi: A United Nations study has ranked India at 134 out of 187 countries in terms of Human Development Index even as it has observed that life expectancy at birth in the country has increased by 10.1 per cent a year over the last two decades. In the 2010 Human Development Report, prepared by UNDP, India had been ranked at 119 out of 169 countries. But the new report for 2011 says it is misleading to compare values and rankings with those of previously published reports, because the underlying data and methods have changed, as well as the number of countries included in the Human Development Index. The report said India's Human Development Index (HDI) value for 2011 was 0.547 positioning the country in the 'medium human development category'. Neighbouring Pakistan was ranked at 145 (0.504) and Bangladesh at 146 (0.500) respectively in terms of HDI. It said between 1980 and 2011, India's HDI value increased from 0.344 to 0.547, an increase of 59 per cent or an average annual increase of about 1.5 per cent. However, the report pointed that the country's HDI of 0.547 was below the average of 0.630 for countries in the medium human development group and below the average of 0.548 for countries in South Asia. The HDI is a measure for assessing long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development such as a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The report said the \"mean\" year of schooling for the country increased by 3.9 years between 1980 and 2011 and expected years of schooling increased by 3.9 years. Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, who was present at the report release function, however, sounded dismissive about the figures in the report. He said a better way of analysing the progress made by countries including India is to measure comparative success they have achieved on this count in the last few years from their previous record rather than by the number of their positions in the international chart. Ramesh said such presentation of human development indices is \"grossly misleading\" and the country's progress in this respect should be seen from a 20-year perspective. He said India has made huge strides in the field of education and water supply system but admitted that the biggest block in the human development indices for India is in the field of sanitation where 58 per cent of open defecation in the world takes place in India. He also rued that a mere expenditure of Rs. 2000 crore in the field of sanitation is being made while the budget for water supply was Rs. 20,000 crore. Ramesh said that the answer to the problem of sanitation is massive public investment in the sector on the lines of what the Central Government has done in education sector.

Gujarat NRE's Australian subsidiary owns and operates two hard coking coal mines in New South Wales (NSW) province of Australia. The company produces 1.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of coking coal and has plans to increase the quantum to 6 MTPA by 2015. Last month, Gujarat NRE Coking Coal Ltd, the Australian subsidiary of the Kolkata-based company, secured approval from the NSW Planning Assessment Commission for a USD 122 million upgrade of its infrastructure at the NRE-1 mine in Russel Vale, Australia. The approval will enable the company to continue to mine up to 1 MTPA of coking coal from the mine over the next three years. Company Executive Chairman Arun Kumar Jagatramka said, \"The grant of the (long-term loan) facility agreement on the back of the approval granted by the NSW Planning Assessment Commission represents another significant milestone for the company.\" Gujarat NRE Coke ( GNCL) had announced last month that by the end of the year, it will make public the USD 250 million new investment plan for the Russell Vale mine, which is estimated to hold 337 million tonnes of coking coal reserves. The proposal is part of GNCL's USD 486 million investment plan for its Australian assets, where it aims to increase total production to 6 MTPA by 2015.

The ministry permitted (us) to go ahead with acquisition of unlisted firms,\" CIL chairman N C Jha said on the sidelines of the company's Foundation Day celebrations attended by Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal. However, the Finance Ministry has not given complete relaxation to the norm of minimum 12 per cent internal rate of return (IRR) from such acquisitions. \"The Finance Ministry has said we can go ahead with the proposals even if the return is below 12 per cent if they are for strategic reasons, but those has to be cleared by them,\" Jha said. He said CIL received proposals offering IRR between 9 and 12 per cent. The Finance Ministry will scrutinise the deals offering below 12 per cent IRR. CIL, the world's largest coal miner, failed to strike any deal due to procedural delays in approval by the government. It had sought relaxation in two parameters of overseas acquisition norms, which were allowing them to acquire stake in unlisted firms, including those offering below 12 per cent IRR. Jha said they would now pursue with some of the proposals lying before them.

The shareholding pattern of the proposed venture is seen as a hurdle in signing the pact. The proposed joint venture aims to set up a plant at an investment of Rs 16,000 crore (Rs 160 billion) in Bokaro to produce three million tonne auto-grade steel. \"We may have 51 per cent equity or it could be 50:50,\" Verma told reporters when asked about the likely shareholding pattern in the JV. A senior official in the ministry, however, said the two parties have nearly reached an understanding to make it an equal joint venture. Posco's patented Finex technology, which would be used in the proposed new plant, is not being used any company other than Posco. Finex is an environment-friendly iron-making process where iron ore fines are directly used. There is also the iron ore price issue which is yet to be resolved, Verma said, adding that if all the pending issues were not cleared within next two days, he might even cancel his tour. The official, however, ruled out cancellation of Minister's visit to Korea. Verma is slated to leave Korea for Russia \\[ Images \\] on November 9 and come back to India on November 12.

State-owned oil firms are currently losing Rs 9.27 per litre of diesel, Rs 26.94 per litre of kerosene sold through the public distribution system ( PDS) and Rs 260.50 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder supplied to households for cooking purposes. The EGoM \"meeting would take place before the Winter Session of Parliament\", beginning November 22, he said, adding that a decision on raising prices may \"not be easy\". The ministerial panel is essentially a consensus-building body of the Congress-led UPA government and comprises key allies like the DMK, TMC and NC. The allies had in September scuttled plans to limit the supply of subsidised LPG cylinders to 4-6 per household in a year so that subsidies can be cut. Reddy said his ministry would push for raising prices of all three regulated products, diesel, LPG and kerosene. On oil companies pressing for a hike in petrol prices, he said PSUs were fully empowered to take a view, keeping in mind rising crude oil prices and depreciating rupee. \"Our ministry does not administer\" the price of petrol, which was freed from government control in June last year, he said. Yesterday, HPCL Director (Finance) B Mukherjee had said that oil firms may have to raise petrol prices, as they were losing Rs 1.50 per litre at the current rates. Hindustan Petroleum sells gasoline in rare tender http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/hindustan-petroleum-sells-gasoline-in-rare-tender/articleshow/10580752.cms SINGAPORE: India's Hindustan Petroleum Corp has sold a rare gasoline cargo through a tender, industry sources said on Wednesday. The refiner sold 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes of 90 RON gasoline for Nov 25-27 loading to Vitol at a discount of $1.75 per barrel to Singapore quotes on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, they said. It is unusual for the Indian state-owned refiner to export gasoline as it is usually a net importer of the product, sources in India said. The cargo was said to be not compatible with the domestic Indian specifications as its sulphur content was too high, they said. \"It's only a one time cargo, public sector units or state refiners don't ever sell gasoline unless it's off-specs, which cannot be sold in the domestic market, so this cargo didn't match the Euro III standards,\" said one of the sources. The sale of the cargo was due to a domestic surplus of the product, a second source said. Vitol is likely to use the cargo for blending purposes, they said. But this could not be verified. GAIL (India) earmarks $400 mn for Singapore LNG trading business in 2012 http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/energy/oil-gas/gail-india-earmarks-400-mn-for-singapore-lng-trading-business-in-2012/articleshow/10580127.cms SINGAPORE: Gail (India) Ltd has earmarked USD 400 million for its new Singapore trading office to secure LNG and petrochemical product cargoes for delivery to India in 2012, Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi announced in Singapore today. Gail's Singapore office, which was inaugurated today but will begin trading next month on getting all formal approvals, will tie-up as much as USD 400 million worth of LNG cargoes and petrochemical products next year for delivery into India, he said after addressing a press conference. Ninety per cent of the trade would be in LNG from the initial start-up. \"India is a huge market for LNG and petrochemical products, while supply remains tight,\" stressed Tripathi, reaffirming Gail's commitment to energy development both within India and globally through an annual investment of USD 2 billion. He also disclosed that Gail was building shale gas expertise through participation in projects in the United States. \"The company is building expertise in shale gas and will participate in the Indian shale gas projects once the government announces its policy and development plans,\" he said. He said participation in US shale gas was a part of Gail's strategy to develop technology, expertise and know-how. Gail, along with its international partners in existing projects, will aggressively bid for shale gas concessions in India once the government puts them up for auction, which is expected to take place in about one year. Oil companies can decide on petrol price hike: Petroleum Ministry PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2591304.ece A day after State-owned oil companies pressed for a petrol price hike, the Petroleum Ministry today said it is up to the oil firms to decide on raising the rates of the deregulated commodity. \"It is for them (oil companies) to decide. They will take a decision at a right time,\" Oil Secretary G.C. Chaturvedi told reporters here. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) Director (Finance) B. Mukherjee had said on Tuesday that oil firms may have to raise petrol prices, as they were losing Rs. 1.50 per litre at the current rates. Mr. Chaturvedi said petrol is a deregulated commodity whose pricing is not decided by the government. \"The oil companies are empowered to take a view on it,\" he said. Indian Oil, HPCL and Bharat Petroleum had last hiked petrol prices by Rs. 3.14 a litre on September 16, when the Indian rupee was valued at about Rs. 48 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate is now over Rs. 49 per U.S. dollar. \"From today, there are some losses on petrol. To cover them, we may have to increase prices,\" Mr. Mukherjee had said on Tuesday. He had stated that crude oil is hovering at around $108 per barrel in international markets. At the current exchange rate, the petrol price of Rs. 66.84 per litre in Delhi is equivalent to a crude oil price of about $102 per barrel. The government had in June last year deregulated, or freed, petrol from all price controls, but the retail rates have not moved in line with the cost as high inflation forced the oil companies to seek \"advice\" from the parent Oil Ministry before revising rates. Mr. Mukherjee did not say when petrol prices would be hiked. \"We are in consultations,\" he said, without elaborating. The loss on petrol is currently Rs. 1.50 per litre and after including local levies, the desired increase in retail prices is Rs. 1.82 per litre. \"Let's say, we are toying with the idea,\" he said. \"It may happen. We will see,\" he added. Besides petrol, the three firms are losing Rs. 333 crore per day on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene below cost. They lose Rs. 9.27 per litre on diesel, Rs. 26.94 per litre on kerosene sold through the public distribution system (PDS) and Rs. 260.50 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder supplied to domestic households for cooking purposes. At the current rate, the industry is projected to lose Rs. 121,459 crore in revenue on the sale of diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene in the full fiscal. While the loss on these three products is compensated through a combination of government cash subsidy and upstream oil firm dole-outs, there exists no such mechanism for making good the losses on petrol, as the product is deregulated Militant Activity/Terrorism (Particularly in Bangalore, Mumbai, Noida, Chennai, Coimbatore) All 15 kidnapped by Maoists in Bihar traceless PTI http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2591362.ece The 15 people abducted by Maoists in Bihar's Jamui district on Monday are yet to be traced even as securitymen intensified operations to rescue them. \"There is still no trace of the kidnapped persons.

Ulfa hardliners warn of fresh attacks http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Ulfa-hardliners-warn-of-fresh-attacks/articleshow/10578603.cms GUWAHATI: After opposing the ongoing peace process and stating that the political conflict between India and Assam could only be resolved by holding discussions on \"sovereignty\", Ulfa hardliners on Tuesday issued a fresh warning of launching attacks on government transport, politicians, black marketers and corrupt officials. In an email sent by Arunodoy Dohotia, the chief of Ulfa's publicity wing, the hardliners asked the public to maintain safe distance from people belonging to any of the above mentioned categories. \"We want to alert everyone to keep away from government transport, vehicles of corrupt politicians and companies utilizing the resources of the state improperly, black marketeers and corrupt officials to avoid any kind of action,\" said Dohotia in the email. Meanwhile, the split between Ulfa hardliners and Arabinda Rajkhowa-led pro-talks faction has once again come to the fore with both sides involved in a mudslinging on the topic of \"sovereign Assam\". Another email sent by pro-talks Ulfa faction's publicity wing member Kamal Kachari rubbished the demand of \"sovereign\" Assam by saying that it has lost relevance in in today's time. \"The state is not asking for an armed movement. Paresh Baruah should not comment on the demand of Assam's sovereignty by staying at a distance. His demand has no relevance in today's time and is very immature,\" said Kachari. He added that the ongoing peace process will not be hampered by Paresh Baruh's personal statements. \"Though Baruah claims to represent the Assamese people, the commoners here don't want any more violence,\" he said in the email. On the other hand, pro-talks Ulfa leader Jiten Dutta was arrested for contempt of court on Tuesday. Dutta was held for not being present in the TADA court several times. He was taken to Guwahati Central Jail in the evening. Naxals gun-down villager on suspicion of being police informer http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/MP-RAI-naxals-gun-down-villager-on-suspicion-of-being-police-informer-2536070.html Raipur: A native of Aljam villge in Khadgaon, Rajanadgaon district, was shot dead by Naxalites on Monday night. The victim was dragged out of his house at night and tried in a Naxal \\`court' where he was found guilty of being a police informer. He was granted the death penalty and shot dead. Naxalites, who were reported to be around 40 in number, also asked all villagers to see the proceedings. More than 35 people have been shot dead in last 2-3 months by Naxalites for the same reason. Police say the act was to instill fear amongst villagers. Naxal activities have been on the rise in Rajanandgaon in recent times. In another brazen act seen recently, Naxalites entered an MLA's residence, snatched his gunner's weapon and escaped. Govt tightens railway security in Naxal areas http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/govt-tightens-railway-security-in-naxal-areas\\_739291.html New Delhi: The government on Tuesday decided to deploy additional forces to protect railway properties and tracks and install CCTV cameras at vulnerable stations located in Naxal-hit areas to check continuous attacks by extremists. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, convened by Union Home Secretary R K Singh and attended by Railway Board Chairman Vinay Mittal and police chiefs of West Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand. The meeting decided to augment the Railway Protection Force Personnel (RPF) in Maoist affected areas in coordination with State police forces to protect railway stations, tracks, godowns and intensify patrolling to ensure smooth running of trains, official sources said. Close Circuit Television Cameras will also be installed at vulnerable stations located in Naxal affected states to prevent extremist attacks. Dedicated officers will also be put in three designated places round the clock to coordinate security in railway properties, particularly on inter-state borders of West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Home Ministry officials are particularly concerned that Maoists have been attacking on goods trains loaded with coal and iron ore affecting industrial activities in different parts of the country as major coal and iron ores mines are located in these states. \"The meeting focused on systemic improvement of railway security,\" an official said. Currently, night running of trains has been suspended along two railway lines passing through the Naxal belt. There were 45 attacks on railway properties in 2010 and 23 this year till October 15. Labor/Social Unrest Pilots stir: Air India pilots move High Court http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/pilots-stir-air-india-pilots-move-high-court/articleshow/10575183.cms MUMBAI: A group representing a section of pilots of Air India has moved the Bombay High Court, challenging the management's decision to train pilots of the carrier's domestic operations in flying the latest Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. In its petition, the Indian Pilots' Guild (IPG) has alleged discrimination on part of the management at the national carrier in giving opportunities for career progression to the pilots of the erstwhile Indian Airlines. Despite the merger of the two state-owned carriers in 2007, issues of integration of pilots remain to be resolved at the cash-strapped airline. The matter, which will come up for hearing on November 2, will most likely be disposed the same day as training for batches of pilots is scheduled to commence the next day. On Tuesday, Air India's international operations suffered due to crew crunch as 23 IPG pilots reported sick. The pilots met the management, but the meeting did not resolve the crisis. The airline, in a statement, however said the pilots will not be going on strike and that operations will be normal. The IPG, which represents about 250 pilots from the airline's international operations, had written to Rohit Nandan, chairman and managing director on October 29, seeking a no-objection certificate for about 100 pilots so that they can find jobs elsewhere. \"We feel cheated by management's unfair and discriminatory decisions leading to a complete stall of our career progression,\" the letter said. Before the merger, Indian Airlines was to get 15 A330 wide body aircraft. \"But since it was decided that the two airlines will be merged, the deal to get the 15 A330s was done away with,\" said a senior commander who is currently flying A320s. \"We were made to understand that since Air India will get the Dreamliners (787s) there was enough scope for us to progress to wide body aircraft.\" The IPG and the pilots union of the erstwhile Indian Airlines, or the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), had agreed to send 16 sets of pilots each for training for the 787, at a meeting with the management two months ago. In December 2010, the then Air India chief Arvind Jadhav had allotted 40 slots of Boeing 787 to the Air India narrow body pilots, a move opposed by the IPG in a letter dated February 15, as an illegal and arbitrary order. The IPG alleges that the management's move to allow ICPA pilots to fly wide body aircraft is a violation of Air India Pilots' wage document and deed of recognition. Senior pilots in Air India say that pilots of ICPA who are flying narrow body aircraft are allowed to fly aircraft on Alliance Air (its domestic regional subsidiary) and they should do so as it flies narrow body aircraft fleet instead of eating into IPG's pie. The ICPA also claims that the commanders of Air India that are supposed to fly the 787 have much less number of flying hours. -- Anya Alfano Briefer STRATFOR T: 1.415.404.7344 \\| M: 221.77.816.4937 www.STRATFOR.com",

How To Fix It?”, with guests: Ayush Sinhal (Founder, Kimbal), Arvind Kothari (Founder, Niveshaay & Equity Investor), and Vivek Jain (Founder, Action Tessa & Equity Investor), October 22, 2025._ ## India’s Hidden Power Crisis GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Ladies and gentlemen, India is undergoing a power crisis. While Modiji claimed to have electrified the entire country in 2018, even as of 2023, 6.7 million people did not have access to electricity in India. While we dream of beating China, India is still witnessing power cuts and our industries are still starving for energy. And while our politicians refuse to answer harsh questions on this matter, we decided to talk to those people who have absolutely no reason to fool you. While most people saw a problem, my guest today, Ayush Sinhal, built a 2,400 crore company by solving this problem. You know what they make? They make this small device called smart meters. And you can find this in any house, any industry and even in schools. But this little device today makes them 2,400 crores. Along with that, we also have Vivek Jain and Arvind Kothari who’ve been investing in India’s power sector for a decade. And they’ve made millions of dollars through their investment. So today we sat down with them to try and understand: Why is India facing such a terrible power crisis? How do we solve this problem? What exactly is their investment thesis to find hidden gems in the market? And most importantly, as entrepreneurs, how can we spot a gold mine opportunity for ourselves? Good morning gentlemen. Today we are here to talk about a national crisis, a crisis that very few people are aware of. We are talking about the power crisis. You know it’s funny that Modiji in 2018 said that we have electrified all villages in India. But even today, millions of Indians still live in darkness. India is glorified as the fourth largest economy. But even then, today our industries still face power outages. And while we want to compete with China and Germany, we are still at the mercy of oil powers and wars. Because every time oil price fluctuates, the Indian economy begins to dwindle. So we are trying everything from E20 to solar to wind to try and come out of this problem. Now, politicians often refrain from answering tough questions. Which is why today I decided to have you guys: a new age entrepreneur, a seasoned entrepreneur and an investor who invests in the stock market and generates growth in revenue. To talk about India’s power problem and how can we solve this problem and become a beneficiary of the solution. Because as investors, we can invest in power companies and become a beneficiary. As entrepreneurs, we can solve this problem and become a beneficiary so that we can be a part of the solution and not just crib about problems. Today, the agenda is pretty simple. We want to understand three very simple things. Number one, why is India facing a power crisis? Number two, as an investor, how can we choose companies that will benefit because of the solution that India will bring in to solve this power problem? And Ayush, from you I want to know, how can a new age entrepreneur build a million dollar business by solving India’s power problem? Because on the outset it looks like this is a game that is meant only for big players like Tata Power and Adani Power. And sir, from you I want an overview of this problem because you’ve been in this industry for decades so that people like me and Ayush can learn from you and become a part of the solution and hopefully make a lot of money. That’s the agenda for today’s podcast. So let’s take one minute to introduce each one of you and then we can get started with the agenda of the podcast, shall we? Sir, let’s start with you. ## Meet the Experts VIVEK JAIN: Hi, thanks for having us here. So I’m an entrepreneur having my own brand called Action Tessa, which is the largest brand for MDF and particle wood in India. We are the largest and the most innovative company in the country. And my past has been with Microtech, which is solving the power problems of the country, the largest inverter manufacturer. So I’ve seen that world closely. So that’s an interesting podcast we are having today for the discussion. And we have a family office also by the name of Arogya Capital, which we fund the right entrepreneurs. We have a framework to do it. We’ll talk about later. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Amazing. Arvind sir. ARVIND KOTHARI: Hi Ganesh, thank you for having us. So Niveshaay, we founded in 2014. The whole mindset was to pick entrepreneurs which are going to change a lot of sectors. But the whole problem was that in India, all sectors which were growing fast were either in the negative list from the banking sector’s point of view of lending, or the equity investors were not that much encouraged to invest over there because of the risk. That is where at Niveshaay, we started to take bold entrepreneur calls. And the journeys that we’ve taken with entrepreneurs like Vivekji has helped us identify companies, try to get mentors for them, try to arrange capital for them. In fact, over the years we’ve also tried to take them public all through our efforts. And that is where we want to keep on doing that journey again and again in sectors which are growing, for sectors which can really change what India’s future is going to look like. Today in a situation where we are, we believe that our founders have that energy, enthusiasm. If funded with the right kind of capital, right set of mentors, they can really unleash the kind of growth that India wants to achieve. So that’s where Niveshaay comes as a bridge to back these companies in terms of financial capital, in terms of investors they want to get on board, or mentors they want to get on board, or even other resources that they want to get on board. So that’s what Niveshaay is all about. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, can you explain what does Niveshaay do? ARVIND KOTHARI: So Niveshaay tries to pool capital from various set of investors or family offices or entrepreneurs and tries to give it to sectors or companies which are growing fast, like energy sector in the country or recycling sector in the country or maybe the computing power ecosystem that we want in the country. That’s where we are: a bridge between founders which want to grow fast and the capital which wants to get deployed in those set of founders. That’s what Niveshaay in brief does. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. Ayush. AYUSH SINHAL: Thank you Ganesh. This is the first time that I’m on the other side of the camera. Otherwise I’ve been just consuming your videos and the other podcasts throughout my life and learning from it. Thank you for giving this opportunity. I’m the CEO and co-founder of Kimbal. We started this company in 2011 with the vision to actually digitize the energy grid, the energy sector all in all. And that is what we have been doing. It’s a product company made in India, made for India and for the world. So yeah, we’ll cover the company further in detail. One thing that you said, to share how energy sector or how this crisis can give the opportunity to create a… you mentioned million dollar or a billion dollar company. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Million dollar companies. AYUSH SINHAL: Million dollar. I think this sector has the potential to create multi-trillion dollar companies. ## Understanding India’s Power Crisis GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Wow guys. First let’s understand the problem better. Why is India the fourth largest economy still facing a power problem? ARVIND KOTHARI: So we have three issues at hand. One is the coal output problem. The other is the grid infrastructure problem. Third is the T&D losses problem. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. Sir, could you please go deeper and explain each problem properly? ## \\\\# The Three Core Problems ARVIND KOTHARI: So Ganesh, if you look at what our country has been doing in the power sector, it was crippled with a lot of policy problems in the past where there was no growth in terms of coal output and still the power plants were put up. Hence these power plants could not make power at the cost that they wanted to because they had to import a lot of coal. That is where the whole crisis started. So biggest problem has been the losses, the T&D losses that our country has. It’s a problem of leakage, right? You can keep on producing more power, but if it is getting leaked out of the system, the losses keep on mounting and we have almost 15 to 16% kind of a loss versus a China where the losses are just 2%. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: 2%? ARVIND KOTHARI: Yes. So that’s where the gap… just imagine any business has EBITDA margin of what, 14, 15% at max, right? And if 15% is just shaved off from these kind of losses in a commodity kind of a sector, how can you make profits? The whole ecosystem doesn’t make profit, hence it is very difficult to seed a lot of investment in that sector. So what we are looking at, the government is trying to plug the loopholes. And please understand, India and China are at the forefront of the energy ecosystem if you think about the capabilities. And we can blame India about a lot of things. But if you go to the grids in the western world, there are grids which have not had investment for decades. They’ve invested very heavily in technology. So the 20, 25 years kind of technology bull run that the U.S. had… but it is now facing a crisis because it did not invest in the energy ecosystem in terms of grid infrastructure, in terms of power manufacturing and hence their data centers are facing a power crisis. We in our country are lucky that at least the capacities are there and capacities are getting built. It is a problem of the whole political will to reduce the T&D losses which is the forefront issue over here. Because if you look at renewable energy, our capacities are growing faster than the U.S. In China also the same thing is happening, right? So in terms of manufacturing of these components as well, solar panels, windmills, T&D equipment, India is at the forefront. In fact, U.S. is importing a lot of this stuff from India and China, right? ## \\\\# The Coal Production Challenge GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: First is, you stated that we used to import coal. We are the fifth largest producer of coal, right? Then why did we have to import coal? ARVIND KOTHARI: So the whole problem was that Coal India, which is a government monopoly, couldn’t increase its output by more than 2% for a decade altogether. And that’s where the energy demand is always higher at 7, 8% and the output of coal is just 2%. And that’s where the whole crisis of domestic coal availability, not the mines but the availability in terms of output was because of the inefficiencies that the monopoly had. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: But why? So why didn’t they produce more power? ARVIND KOTHARI: See, it’s a government undertaking, right? And it faces a lot of challenges in terms of approval. So it’s just not about whether Coal India wants to produce or not. It’s also about the judiciary and the local public, their revolt and whether approvals of those mines take time. So the whole process in a way took a lot of time. And then the bureaucracy of the company itself meant that the output could not be brought on time, which we wanted. And that’s where I guess we got crippled in this crisis which led to import of a lot of coal, exchequer doling out a lot of dollars out of the country and the whole power cost in the country did not come down, even though the capacity was there. ## \\\\# The Renewable Energy Solution So I guess with renewables that problem is getting solved. We don’t need any output which is going to come from a mine or any input which is coming from any of the natural resources. The resource which is available full time. And the whole problem is being solved by entrepreneurs and the government building an ecosystem about solar and wind, where the hybrid parks or with storage… Now, with the whole solution, now we are looking at where almost the country’s incremental demand is completely met by renewables and even replacement demand is met by renewables. And that is where I believe a lot of these challenges… if we solve the storage problem. So renewables have a storage problem. They cannot be stored. So now already the government has been working on hybrid parks where storage is also there. Two hour storage will then go to four hour storage. So I believe the problems of the past would not haunt us in the future because we’ve made very good investments in the grid and we are doing that. Power Grid has done a phenomenal job in terms of making our grid able to transact power between states. It’s very difficult. In U.S., you don’t have that. In U.S. there are states which don’t talk to each other. In India we have all the states who talk to each other in terms of energy flow and hence the ecosystem is robust. We need to upgrade it for the modern requirements of the renewable energy sector. But if that is in tandem, going hand in hand, we believe the solution to this problem is in the very near future. ## Understanding T&D Losses GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. And the second problem that you mentioned was T&D losses. Can you explain T&D losses in simple words? ## Understanding TND Losses in India’s Power Sector **ARVIND KOTHARI:** So TND losses in simple words is basically you’re producing an output of 100 units, but when it is going and reaching the end consumer, it is only reaching around 85 units. So there are 15 units being lost. 15 units can be lost due to various factors. Either you’re not stepping up and stepping down power efficiently because the grid needs to transport the power. So there can be losses in the transportation that are natural, but those also can be reduced by investment in the grid. Then there can be leakages in terms of people drawing unauthorized power in a country where a lot of consumers draw that unauthorized power. And also there can be a lot of issues in terms of manufacturing the power. So power cannot be stored, right? If it is manufactured, it needs to be dispatched. So if the demand and supply is not matched properly, we lose power over there also. So a lot of substation infrastructure needs to be upgraded to do that. ## The State of India’s Grid Infrastructure **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** And so the third problem that we spoke about was the grid infrastructure. In fact we had Shreya over here some time ago. She is the co-founder of Solar Square and she said that the grid infrastructure in India is broken and that needs to be fixed. So what do you first of all mean by a grid infrastructure and what is broken about it? **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Yeah, so what is a grid? Please understand a grid is basically an infrastructure where there are transmission lines which are set up for the power to reach the consumers. Right. So if I’m producing in for example Kachav, Gujarat, I need electricity in Surat. So it needs to be transmitted and that happens through these transmission lines. And the grid is set up by the power grid of country and it has a lot of players which help power grid to do that. But that is where the whole grid infrastructure is put up to transport power. Now this transportation can be just within Gujarat, can be just within Rajasthan or within Maharashtra. But we have been lucky that there have been a lot of investment made in the country to build a national grid which then talks to each other and then any power surplus in the state can be transported to a deficient state. And that infrastructure though is a bit outdated in certain places is needed to be fixed, but we have the necessary ingredients. I would say it is not broken to the extent that we’ve seen in Europe or maybe in the US. It is definitely much, much better as infrastructure which can enable a lot of new technologies that we are talking about. And if done properly, the TND losses in the country can also reduce if these upgrades are happening. Of course the old grid was made by a thesis that power would be made at a particular place and it would be transported to the consumers in the whole country. But now the reality is every household can be a producer of power by solar or every company can be a producer of power with solar and these kind of technologies, right? So now we have a problem that you need a two-way communication in the grid, that there can be consumers and producers at the same time at every household or every corporate. And that is where, if not properly enabled, the grid could cripple or the grid crisis could come because it is not able to do these adjustments of collecting and disseminating power. And that is where we are talking about that energy ecosystem has a great runway in our country because we will need a lot of investments to enable the grid. A lot of companies would come around with solutions of selling power to each other, which Kimbal is also in a way producing a software which can enable buying and selling of power on the exchange. So we have an exchange ecosystem in a country where power is freely traded. So what I’m trying to tell you is we can look at the problem. There is a problem. But the point is where are we in terms of the solution? So we have built the blocks already. It will require significant investment. But we are not far away out because if the basic building blocks were not there, we might have taken maybe 15, 20 years. Now with these blocks in place, we are maybe 5, 7 years away from the solution rather than 10, 20 years away from the solution. ## The Power Supply Chain Explained **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** That is amazing, sir. Ayush, could you please lay down the entire supply chain of power and help me understand how is power delivered to the households of India all the way from the production of coal? **AYUSH SINHAL:** So the start of the supply chain is the manufacturing unit which we call generation over here. So you have Coal India extracting coal and then feeding it to thermal power plants. These thermal power plants in turn then produce energy. This energy is then, so what happens is the energy has to be evacuated from the source to be taken to the destination which is the consumers like us on the grid. This is done by transmission. Transmission steps up the power so that the losses are minimized. They get from the source to the demand and then from the demand side the distribution jobs come in. Distribution role is to actually distribute power to every consumer. See how much a consumer has consumed, bill it accordingly and then do the collection. This is where the distribution comes in. So the consumer has an option to buy power either from the distribution companies or they have the power to buy power directly from a factory, directly from a generating plant. That is where these trading companies like we have IEX and PXIL coming in in the picture. So this is how if you look at the complete value chain of the energy flow through. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** So first comes Coal India, then we go to power generation. Then power transmission happens and then power distribution happens. And then we have the traders. Right. So discoms, if I’m not wrong, fall where? Power distribution. **AYUSH SINHAL:** Distribution. Yes. ## The Discom Crisis: Why Are They Bleeding Money? **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Discoms is a classic case study. For the longest time we’ve been hearing that Indian discoms are in losses. And these are not losses worth hundred crores or 200 crores. We’re talking about thousands of crores. In fact the last time I checked I think it was somewhere around 38,000 crores or 40,000 crores. So we have coal. We are getting electricity at an affordable rate. How are discoms in losses? **AYUSH SINHAL:** Interestingly, the number is way higher than that. It is around 2% of India’s GDP. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** 2% of India’s GDP? Yes. Is what we are losing. Yes. Why? **AYUSH SINHAL:** The problem is not somewhere in the demand or the supply. It is in between. So think of it as a water pipeline. Right? You are feeding water at one end and you are drawing power at the other end. The leakage is in between. And you are unable to detect where the leakages are. And you’re just bleeding or you’re just leaking energy out of that. And the system is so large that is impossible to detect without modernizing. Without actually having the information on what is happening where. And you don’t have even taps. So even if you get to know that there’s a leakage at some area, there’s no tap that you can regulate sitting over here. So that’s another challenge that you face in the grid today. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Are those TND losses? **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Yeah. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Okay. Vivek sir, can you throw more light on that as to why do we have this problem? Like Arvind sir mentioned that we lose 15% of our energy because of TND losses. And in China it’s 2 to 3%. Why is India so far behind? ## The Changing Power Ecosystem **VIVEK JAIN:** So the basic as Arvind and Ayush were talking about recently that now the whole ecosystem has changed. Earlier it was only there’s one power producer. They are consumers. And the consumer were also the quantity of consumption was less. The mind was ready. “4 hours power will not be there every day. I will go on the street, play around. I’m ready,” right? The whole mindset is changing. The power consumption increasing exponentially. Ganesh, if I ask you in your home now, earlier it was there in one bedroom. Air condition will be there now in almost, I’m sure in all your rooms the air conditioning is there. You must be using an EV now because that’s the new, I recently heard is saying no charges on an EV if you use that. Right? So people are transitioning to that. Right? So if you see the airports coming up, what are airports? They are power guzzlers, right? We see data center as now Ayush was mentioning that 99% of power will go to the AI. So that’s the whole thing happening. So now we have producers actually everywhere, right? The government was not ready. Actually nobody was ready in the world. Right? Nobody thought that the solar production, especially solar can be at any home can have a 10 kilowatt, 5 kilowatt at their home. At their home and in home the power consumption is not there because everybody goes to school, the offices and now what to do with that power. So Modi ji, the government has done a great job in getting this solar into the country and they’re working very hard today practically the solar production, the cost in India is among the cheapest in the world which is actually helping the GDP to grow. Because if we want the GDP to grow the country then the power has to be there and the power has to be rightly available plus rightly used. It cannot be wasted. As we understand from electronics that once power is produced, if it is not stored or if it’s not used, it’s gone. It’s not like it’s a perishable item, right? It’s gone. Right? So now when we see BESS coming in, the battery energy solar system coming in, right? Where companies like us, when we have power producer on the rooftop solar we have in our plant, like we have 10 megawatt right now, if we are not consuming power, we can store the power or we can supply to the grid. So that’s why the grid modernization of maybe having smart meters or maybe having SCADA system building, all those things are very important to ultimately help the Indian economy to reach to the dream which we have of 2047. That’s where I’m coming from. ## The Solar Revolution in India **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. Arvind sir, I read in your research that India is embracing solar because there has been a drastic drop in the cost of production via solar. Can you explain what that is about? And why are we suddenly seeing a rise of the solar revolution in India? ## The Solar Revolution and Smart Meter Opportunity ARVIND KOTHARI: Correct. So when we first started to bet on the solar sector, there was a lot of disbelief in the whole ecosystem, in the investment community everywhere. It’s a sector which is funded by the government. When was the… In fact, we started investing 2019, but I go far back, went on 13, 14. We in fact wrote a report which was a white paper which was presented on solar in the country and had power cost to be at 16 rupees per unit when it was made from solar versus 4 or 3 rupees that were made from coal. So solar was almost 4x more expensive than what coal output was able to produce in the country. But what was happening is that it was falling off the cliff, the power generation cost from solar because the solar panel cost was reducing dramatically. It is like every other technology like you look at computing. The computing cost has gone down by 90 percent and then gone down by 90% and then gone down by 90% almost three, four times in the past 20, 25 years. So this is what is happening with solar also. And when such a technology is reducing cost, it is very tough for its competing technologies to then take over. And you think about it as a power solution. Solar is plug and play. You look at any other… So the problem that I was talking about in the earlier piece on why Coal India output did not take pace with the energy generation because the output needs to be mined and then there should be a power plant put up by NTPC and then the power generation happens and then it needs to be transported. The whole ecosystem from mining till NTPC putting up a plant can take 4, 5 years to come together, right? If you think about solar, you just need a piece of land. Panels can be produced in the same day and they can be transported to the site. And the whole substation and ecosystem can just take 4 months, 5 months, 6 months at max to be brought to life. You think about any other solution in this world which is power hungry, as Ayush was talking about or Vivek was talking about. We need AI which needs power right now. And nuclear is talking about the solution ten years from now. [ALSO READ:Transcript: Pyramids, Lost Technology & The Flood – w/ Archaeologist Tim Alberino](https://singjupost.com/transcript-pyramids-lost-technology-the-flood-w-archaeologist-tim-alberino/) Gas powered power plants are having shortages in terms of equipment. They’re five years delays in terms of a lot of those kind of power plants that are being put in the US. Here you have a solution that can be put up as and when you want, plug and play it anywhere that you want and is reducing cost of producing power because the equipment cost is falling. Raw material is practically free. So you don’t have any variables, right? It is not that I need uranium or I need coal or I need XYZ. The power can be generated by a resource which is freely available. There is no fluctuation in terms of the timeline of putting up that power plant and there is no fluctuation in the equipment cost much. In fact, it is reducing every year. So that is where it is an insane technology which is going to be dominant no matter what the world talks about that this problem doesn’t have a solution. This has a solution. ## The Intermittency Challenge and Battery Storage The only problem with solar is that it is intermittent. It cannot be generated 24 by 7. So you have to solve for the intermittency. Now how do you solve for the intermittency? That is where battery storage comes into picture, which was also expensive if you talk about five years ago, which has reduced by almost 50% in the past five years, which can also have the same technology cost which solar had maybe 15 years ago. And it can also reduce by 90% in the coming decade. So that is where a solution of intermittency, if it is clubbed with solar, is a powerful technology which can outpace any other technology that we are talking about. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, what was the cost per unit for production of energy via solar in 2009 versus today in 2025? ARVIND KOTHARI: So 2009, if you talk about it would be around 20, 22 rupees per unit and today it has fallen off toward 1.8 or 2 rupees. That’s a kind of reduction, that almost 90% reduction in the cost that we’ve seen already. And if you talk about the equipment cost in terms of solar panel manufacturing ecosystem that our country has, it is further reducing and it will further reduce in the coming five, seven years. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. VIVEK JAIN: Cost has come to 1.6 now. ARVIND KOTHARI: 1.6. Okay, so almost like 94%, 95%. ## Micro Grids and Village Electrification GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, this makes solar almost miraculous because the cost is decreasing with time. And the best part is like you mentioned, there is no requirement of a very complex supply chain. So is it safe to say that the next 100 villages in India that will be electrified, will be electrified by solar and not the grid? ARVIND KOTHARI: Yeah. So if you think about lot of these villages can have a micro grid which can be like storage and solar just there for that ecosystem or for that village or for that cluster of villages. And you do not put them up in the main grid. That is where US is also now talking about micro grids for these data centers where they need not be connected to the grid for their energy requirements because then they can create a lot of havocs on the grid. Right? So that kind of solution already has just one bottleneck which is the power storage cost. People are talking about storing it through via green hydrogen as I was talking about, or battery storage, but both cost currently at this stage are not viable for 100% storage solution. Maybe battery energy storage is now viable for 3, 4 hours. It will get more viable when it is more viable to store energy for 24 hours. That is where we believe that the takeoff can be miraculous as you were talking about. ## The Smart Meter Opportunity GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. And this takeoff will have two massive opportunities. Firstly, because there is two way power transmission that’s happening which is where the demand for smart meters will shoot up. And secondly, there will also be a huge demand for batteries. Like Vivek sir said, power is perishable. If you don’t store it, you will lose it. So Arvind sir, is it safe to say that with the increase in number of solar panels there will also be a disproportionate increase in the number of smart meters and batteries? Which means there’s a massive opportunity there, right? ARVIND KOTHARI: So if you think about the solar opportunity is the incremental opportunity, right, that you need to put up for the energy that is being demanded every year. But the problem that you need to solve in terms of the grid communicating or the smart meter that you want to put in or the energy that you want to store, it is a problem that you need to solve for all the existing capacity and the new capacity that is going to come up. So if you look at there was a survey that was made maybe in 2016, 17 by the government where we had almost 250 million meters in the country which need to be smart. Now today that number would be anywhere between 300, 350 million. And by 2030 it is expected that it will be around 500 million meters. Now if you imagine we have only converted close to about 20, 25 million meters to smart and we have to convert now 500 million meters to be smart meters in the country. People talk about that Zomato is the biggest opportunity in the country because so many households they are serving, how many percentage of the household. And you think about how much percentage of the household will a smart meter have an opportunity to be in, collecting data, disseminating data to the government, being a piece which is solving the energy equation. So the size of the opportunity over here is huge. If you think in terms of how it is going to solve the data collection problem and the T&D loss problem and battery energy storage also, it will need to have in corporates, in households. And that is where Nandan Nilekani I guess has been talking about that it is the next UPI moment of the country. And I believe as an ecosystem this will change a lot of things that people talk about our country. If we get this act together, whatever problems that we are currently facing, people blaming India for a lot of infrastructure challenges, this, that, a lot of things from that power angle, there are a lot of things which are very rightly placed in terms of the government support, government infrastructure and the money that these companies have raised in terms of putting up that capacity in the country. So I believe that ecosystem can really be one of the best ecosystem that is investable in our country at this point. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, this is amazing. So you are telling me that India will need 500 million smart meters and we will need what, hundred companies? ## Market Consolidation and Efficiency ARVIND KOTHARI: The whole piece that the government has tried to solve is by bringing in companies which can deploy the smart meters on the ground. And they’ve been given a free hand to choose the meter companies that they want to deal with. So here you’re not communicating with the government. You are now communicating with private enterprises who are deploying the meters on ground. And the meter companies need to then become vendors with these companies. And the whole collection mechanism works in a way that the efficiency of collection is what determines your payment in terms of what you get from the government. So if the meter is not efficient, you don’t get the collection that you are aiming for. And hence the whole system is made for efficiency. So like in other sectors, what we are seeing is the most efficient company wins. So currently also in our country, there are hardly three, four companies which are like almost 80% market share in the country. And we have Kimbal today on the podcast which has become the second largest and aiming for becoming the largest. And they will have a market share of almost 30% this year. 30% in this market which is growing at this astronomical pace is what the size of the opportunity we are talking about. ## Ayush’s Origin Story GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Ayush bro, how on earth did you discover this gold mine? This is insane, bro. Because you know the reason why I think this is insane is because we often see the opportunities that are glorified. Like Arvind spoke about Zomato, Swiggy, UPI, content creation. All of these things are seen as massive opportunities. And Nikhil Kamath often says that the most amount of money can be made with boring businesses. That is why he’s made a lot of money. But tell me something. Today you generate 2,400 crores in revenue. When did you start? AYUSH SINHAL: We started in 2011. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: 2011. So you’ve been operating this company for about 14 years and today you’re generating 2,400 crores in revenue. How on earth did you discover the demand for smart meters in 2011? AYUSH SINHAL: I still remember when I was doing my engineering in Bangalore. So we all, we used to, we stayed in a flat, three of us, we stayed in a flat and we used to get our money, pocket money every month. Well, in time. But the least priority was given to paying the energy bills. So we used to approach it to pay off the Internet bill. I think the Internet bill used to come, the priority was way higher than the energy bill. And then someone from BESCOM, that was the discom in Bangalore, used to come at the end of the month, disconnect your power supply and go back. And we used to come back from college and realize, oh, there’s no power. And we didn’t pay for it. And we used to just collect the money within matter of minutes. So there was the willingness to pay was always there. It was just that the priority was low because you could afford to do that, right? And when that happens, we used to go somewhere, get the linemen to pay them, do whatever it takes and reinstate the power, right? And I still remember that led me to search if it’s happening with us. How many consumers are facing this particular piece or how many… What is the default rate of a consumer or what is the willful defaulters? You can say any number, astonish me. I still remember just to be on the conservative side and on the higher side, 92 or 93% of the energy that reaches the consumer is billed. So balance gets lost. And out of the billed only 94 or 95% is collected. So balance again gets lost. So as I said, right in the pipeline there are multiple leakages, is just one. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: So you just discovered that there were a lot of boys like yourself who are not paying electricity bills. So the discoms might be facing a problem collecting these bills. So you want to find an efficient way for them to collect money from boys. ## The Power Sector’s Fundamental Challenges **AYUSH SINHAL:** I still remember back in 2011, I was in my fourth year of college. We were still talking about what my grandfather used to talk about: electricity, food, waste. These were the rudimentary issues that we were talking about. Whereas, as a kid in a college, we were talking about smartphones, we were talking about Internet coming in 2G, 3G, 4G. But the basic pieces were just not there at pace. And as you said, glamorous industries do seek all the attention and get the best of the minds to work on it. But the power sector is the backbone of anything and everything, and it takes time to build something like this. It took us 13 to 14 years to scale to where we are. But now the trajectory is something like a hockey stick. Just recently, yesterday, I read an article by Elon Musk who says that real competition to his AI model, the Grok, is not OpenAI. It’s not Google. It is China, and China because of two reasons. One, because of the chips, the capability and ability to manufacture advanced chips, the manufacturing competency that they have. And second is the energy, the abundance of energy. AI just needs energy to function. And we are entering an era where everything and anything is touched by AI. So that is where the energy plays an important role in anything and everything that we do in the nation building, in the economy, or every company that is there. ## Spotting the Market Opportunity **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. So Ayush, like I said, you’re generating 2,400 crores in revenue by making smart meters. Help me understand, how did you spot this gap at the macro level? At the micro level, you mentioned that you did not pay the electricity bills, because of which you discovered a gap. Now, at the macro level, how did you take this company forward and how did you anticipate this growth? Or did you even anticipate this growth? **AYUSH SINHAL:** You started in 2011. We realized the energy demand in the country is going to increase like anything. There was definitely an aspirational growth that was driving the demand, and more than that, industrialization and everything. And we’ve been just discussing how energy is the key, right? So one, we were bullish on saying that the energy demand is going to increase. Second, the sector was plagued with inefficiencies. With every unit sold or every rupee of energy that you sell, if you lose one rupee, so imagine when you start selling 100 rupee worth of energy, you start making losses of 100 rupee. So that’s the second piece that we spotted. We realized there’s a massive modernization that is required to support this. And that is what gave birth to Kimbal. ## Understanding Smart Meters **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. What exactly is a smart meter and how is it different from a conventional meter? **AYUSH SINHAL:** See, the dumb meters have always been there. The challenge with the dumb meter is the information which is recording is just not accessible anywhere in the world. You have to physically access that particular device and download the data. Now imagine in India, a country like India, which has 50 crore consumers by 2030, human physically going and accessing and downloading the data is next to impossible. Whereas a smart meter has two key pieces. One, whatever information is recording, it can relay that information to a remote location, to any cloud, on your mobile phone. You can access that data. That is how it is. Second, critical piece is that it can regulate your demand. It can switch off your load, it can power on again, reinitiate your load. More than that, it can somewhere stabilize, saying that you cannot draw more than 5 kilowatt, you cannot draw more than 6 kilowatt. So this is what a smart meter does. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. **AYUSH SINHAL:** And third critical piece over here is the measurement is way more efficient than what it was done in the traditional meters. **VIVEK JAIN:** Right. **AYUSH SINHAL:** See, generally if you look at any device that you procure, so let’s say if you buy a mobile phone, you put a mobile cover to it, you put a screen laminate on top of it because you want the device to last. Whereas a consumer behavior with an energy meter or with a smart meter is that the device should stop recording from tomorrow. The first thing that a consumer gets to know when they interact with me, that we do smart metering, the first thing that they want to know is how do they stop a smart meter? How do they reduce their energy bill by the smart meter not functioning? So the meters are designed in such a way that they’re more efficient, they record the energy better, and they’re actually immune towards the consumer tampering. This is where the smart meter comes in. ## The Distribution Model **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. So after making these meters, who did you go and sell this to? **AYUSH SINHAL:** We sell this to Discoms. In Delhi, we have Tata Power and BSES is the discom. So they are our customers. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** When you sell this to Discoms, they then go and install these meters at the customer’s house. **AYUSH SINHAL:** Most of the discoms in the country are government owned. 95% of the discoms in the country are public sectors. Right now the government realized that it is impossible for them, for the discom people and for them to roll out such a massive operation in time. We’re talking about 100% replacement. This massive activity has never been done anywhere in the world. So what they did was they called intermediary. In between, smart meters come in with different components and they together solve a problem of the customer which is better revenue, better collection, better efficiency. **VIVEK JAIN:** Right. **AYUSH SINHAL:** These components are: one is the smart meter which is the measurement box. Second is the connectivity, getting the data online. And third is application running on the cloud which is processing the data and converting into information. These three together they form a solution. They actually address your problem. You buy any of the best component, a single component not interacting well together or not integrated well together will have zero impact. So here what they did was they said I need an integrator in between. I need the integrator to select the three different components, deploy it on ground, and then run it for life. This is where a company like contracting companies like Tata Power, Adani Power or Nagarjuna Construction Company, Monte Carlo, these are the companies. They come in, they win the contract from the Egyptian company, and then we supply to them. ## Demand Regulation and Consumer Behavior **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. How can it regulate the demand and supply? Because by deploying a smart meter, you can definitely measure efficiency. I’m able to envision how will the calculation be more accurate as compared to the existing meters. But how will the regulation happen? How will you prompt me to stop charging my car? **AYUSH SINHAL:** So what I can do is I can regulate by saying that, okay, the charges are in kilowatts. Let’s say your normal demand of an AC and a light may be 3 kilowatt. The charger puts an additional load of 3 kilowatts. So I can put a ceiling of saying that you will just draw 3 kilowatt for this period of time. As soon as your energy goes above that, your electricity completely will be cut off. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** But wouldn’t that require my permission? **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Yes. **AYUSH SINHAL:** So obviously you need to participate in programs like this. And what is happening is, see, you will be incentivized to participate over here and your tariff will go down eventually. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Can you explain? **AYUSH SINHAL:** So what will happen is, I’ll give you again an example. In Maharashtra, the chief minister has come up with a fantastic program where he’s saying that the consumer will have a different tariff for solar hours and a different tariff for non-solar hours. This is called time of use billing. **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Time of use billing. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Okay. **AYUSH SINHAL:** So eventually the consumer will start charging their vehicles during the solar hours. You’ll wash your clothes during the solar hours and eventually your bill will reduce. So this is how playing with the demand and supply eventually reduces your energy cost. So here I’ll come as a utility, maybe over here as a Maha Discom. I’ll come to you and Ganesh, I’ll say, “Ganesh, if you participate in a demand response program whenever there’s crisis, I want you to reduce your load. I want you to reduce your load maybe by 20%, 30%.” And you can do that because these are the auxiliary loads or supply that you have, which you can always do. If you do that, I’ll give you a rebate of 20% over your total bill. See, because the utility, when there’s crisis, when the power plant from Kutch didn’t supply, when they have to go to a trader like an IEC to buy, they buy the power which is generally available at 2 rupees or 3 rupee, at maybe 15 rupee, at maybe even 20 rupee. Whereas as a consumer we will be paying only around 6 to 7 rupee. So that is where for them, for you to cut down your, regulate your demand, will eventually reduce the overall power cost. ## The Equity Question **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** One question that I had, Ayush, is that when it comes to a poor consumer, for them this incentive means a lot. They can actually change their habits just so that they can have these incentives. But as you go to the top of the pyramid, the incentive is not lucrative enough. For example, if you tell me that I will save 20% of my electricity bill if I don’t charge my car, I will never listen to you. So isn’t this in a way controlling the behavior of the consumer at the bottom of the pyramid while giving all the liberty in the world to the people at the top of the pyramid? Because as they say, fine is nothing but the amount of money that you pay to commit the crime. **VIVEK JAIN:** Interesting, right? **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** So here you’re essentially telling me that instead of the fine, incentive is just a better word for a fine. Because what you’re essentially doing is that you’re changing the pricing structure in such a way that instead of saying that I will take money from you, you’re saying that I will take less money from you if you do a certain thing, a certain way. So don’t you think that is an injustice being done to the people at the bottom of the pyramid? **AYUSH SINHAL:** See, again, if you look at the country, today, 90% of the users sit in that pyramid. If you’re able to reduce the cost by whatever it is and by getting the consumer to participate in that particular program, that is fantastic. And over there, 20%, 30% matters a lot. And it is just not 20%, 30% of today’s cost. The cost is increasing because the behavior trend is changing. Today, the EVs, the two wheeler, three wheeler or four wheelers, whatever they have, they’re going to be charged from the grid. Now, that percentage of the money is spent on petrol or diesel or something like that. So the bill is going to increase. And over there, the 20, 30% matters immensely. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. But EVs are extremely costly. And if you look at the behavioral pattern of consumption at the bottom of the pyramid, it’s usually only for necessary consumption. It’s used for fans and not ACs. It’s used to watch TV, which the poor consumer watches barely for an hour. It’s used for charging your phone or it’s used for studying. And if you tell them that if you consume less power or if you consume power at a certain time, don’t you think the father of the house is going to care more about the electricity bill than the child who’s studying under the fan? ## From Consumer to Prosumer **AYUSH SINHAL:** So a couple of things over here again. One, I will link it to the PM Suryaghar Yojana that we have. The Prime Minister of the country has a very ambitious goal of saying that 1 crore household will have a solar panel on their rooftop. Now interestingly, for a certain set of consumers, just from being consumers you can become a prosumer or you can become a producer. What do you mean by producer is, I am a generator now. I am producing power and I can sell it to the grid. I can sell it to my peer. This is what Arvind sir, when he mentioned that Nandan Nilekani is saying and he’s been consulted by the government of saying that let’s create an Indian energy stack and that can be India’s next UPI movement. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. **AYUSH SINHAL:** Where Indian energy stack means every device will start communicating in a universal method and these consumers can start trading energy. So let’s say when I have extra power I can just give it to you Ganesh and I can sell it to you and you can pay me. So instead of just being a consumer of power I can start earning money out of it by producing and selling. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. So what you’re saying is that we will not just change the way people use power but we’ll also enable people to produce more power. Because of which they won’t be constrained. **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Yes. ## Identifying Investment Opportunities in Energy Solutions GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Correct. Okay. Whom should I approach? Let’s say I have a solution for this. Whom should I approach? AYUSH SINHAL: Utilities today are hungry for solutions like this. Today the new age utilities like Tata Power, like Adani, they’re waiting for someone to come in and offer them something. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Can a youngster come and do this at Kimbal? AYUSH SINHAL: Definitely yes. The journey that you were talking about, right from 2011, from a 10 lakh revenue company to a 2,400 crore company, right? This has been done because of the people that we have. So this company truly believes in people. The whole culture that we have, we have a culture of saying that there’s a culture of absolute trust in candor. We believe in saying that there’s no rules and we mean it. You know, today any individual, so there’s no age bias in this organization. I think one, me being so young, that today on a table a 23 year old kid’s voice and a 50 year old voice has the same weightage. So that’s one beautiful thing that we’ve done over here. Another thing to look at, see today, if I want to buy equipment, if I want to allocate a budget and whatever the amount may be, I’m scared of saying that in front of my investors. But whatever that amount may be, whether it is 10 lakh, 1 crore, 50 crore, if you’re aligned towards the company’s goal, if you’re aligned towards the company vision, you don’t need any approval. So that is the kind of culture that we’ve built. There is zero attendance over here. There is zero expense policy. We just have a book of trust. You need to align yourself with that. So what do we believe is the problems this energy transition is throwing at you? It is something new. This problem was just not there yesterday. Yesterday we were not talking about solar, right? These problems have come up now. [ALSO READ:Transcript of Michael Shellenberger on The Tucker Carlson Show](https://singjupost.com/transcript-of-michael-shellenberger-on-the-tucker-carlson-show/) So you need newer solutions. So this is where agility matters. This is where innovation matters. And Kimbal is a perfect platform for that. Kimbal has built that platform where someone can just come in, think of a problem, think of a solution and start running towards it. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: That’s amazing man. So are you telling me that an intern can come into your company, identify a problem and get a budget to build an enterprise within an enterprise to go and solve that problem? ## AI-Powered Grid Solutions AYUSH SINHAL: Very recently we had three kids from IIT Delhi and three from IIT Bombay. They ended up building a solution which can be explosive, which can change the complete way the grid operates. Today again, young kids, they don’t know anything. They’re not bounded by any limitation, right? What they did was they worked very closely with the utility, with the discom in the country. By just analyzing the data, they were able to map which transformer supplies power to which all consumers. This is one of the most difficult things. Generally people go physically and map it. Okay, this is the transformer. The wire is going to Ganesh’s house, the wire is going to Vivek’s house, the wire is going to Arvind’s house. So this transformer is applying to these three houses. What they did was using AI, they found a signature through which with a 95% accuracy, they have been able to detect which consumer is connected to which transformer. Now this particular simple solution can literally cut down the 2% losses to zero overnight. So 2 lakh crore losses can go down to zero. Because this enables certain functionality for the utility to be used where they can pinpoint the leakages, where they can pinpoint the losses and plug it immediately. That is the power of this particular solution. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Understood. So the first opportunity lies in data analysis. The second and third opportunity lies in the second piece. ## Three Major Opportunities in Energy Tech AYUSH SINHAL: We are all talking about EVs and I think every other house has an EV today, right? For an EV you don’t go to a petrol pump, you go to a charging station. The electrons are flowing and charging, right? A simple app to unify all the charges has massive potential, right? Just not that, scheduling when to charge, when not to charge is going to have massive potential. So vehicles, you need to think of vehicles as batteries, as moving batteries on the grid which can be plugged in and plugged out as and when required. So the concept is called V2X or V2G, vehicle to grid. This particular domain is explosive. You can have hundreds of Kimbals just in this particular domain itself. Third one I believe solar, right? Solar has again tremendous potential. ARVIND KOTHARI: Again. AYUSH SINHAL: You have a solar park. There’s a lot of analysis that you can do. You can work with the data to increase the yield of that particular asset and it doesn’t require any cost. So you put in hundreds of crores to put in that capex of solar plant and maybe just with lakhs of rupees you can increase the yield by percentages. So that is one. The PM Surya Ghar Yojana where the prime minister’s ambition is to put in 1 crore rooftop solar. Now these consumers becoming prosumers. So imagine Ganesh trading energy with Ayush in a real time basis. You have excess energy just like UPI. You PayTM me that energy and I start using it. Now this P2P trading or how do I access my solar better, how do I feed it to the grid better? This particular opportunity again is tremendous. These are just three of the opportunities that’s coming on top of my mind. There are hundreds of them like that. ## The Entrepreneurial Approach to Investing GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it? Understood. Arvind sir, how do you, how did you choose Kimbal and how do you pick companies like these? Because I have read your research papers and the thesis are just so comprehensive that even a newbie will be able to understand the progressions of the Indian stock market very well, right? In fact we’ve presented a lot of your research papers on our videos also. So help me understand how do you identify these companies which eventually go on to become multi-baggers. ARVIND KOTHARI: So the approach when I actually came to investing was that of entrepreneur because my family background was entrepreneurship. I was in a city which in Gujarat we have entrepreneurship mindset. So the normal way of working, people just try to understand the mechanisms of the market functioning. That never appealed to me. In fact, I failed at investing initially because I was trying to get into that rut of understanding the market. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: What do you mean by that now? ARVIND KOTHARI: By meaning to understand the market dynamics is to know how the market is behaving. The behavior of the market is very complex. Every day there are millions of buyers and sellers trying to decide the price of a company. And deep down inside I could not understand that behavior because I thought on first principle basis, it’s a business which has value and the value over the years increases if it is able to grow in terms of its capabilities and the revenues can come later. The capability part is important because I had seen a lot of companies in the family, within us, a lot of good businesses go down because the capabilities were not being built and a very small business becoming very big even though they were struggling for a decade because they were building capabilities and learning over the years. So my mindset always was that if I am able to deploy that analogy to understanding businesses in the market, that is where I am more comfortable. I am not that comfortable understanding the market behavior. The human psychology of investing or whatever the books in investing are written about, are written about the psychology of what an investor is or on the psychology of how the markets, and we have stories like this where the greatest of the greatest were being bankrupted in the markets because they could not understand the psychology of the market. So how we started is, let’s forget about what the psychology of the market is. I don’t know that. Can I understand how a business functions and can I understand how value is created in a business? That is what the starting point was. And initially for almost seven, eight years, we did not have a business model because we were trying to put up research papers as you very rightly talked about. And in India no one pays for that research, right? Then we started to think that can we bring those research papers to people who are entrepreneurs themselves? And that is where the business model Niveshaay came live, where entrepreneurs like Vivek ji or like a lot of family offices that we have, we presented to them investments like their own business investments and not like any other stock market investment. I remember when I met Vivek ji, he had some 50 mutual funds, some 30, 40 other funds that he was investing with. VIVEK JAIN: Total 98. AYUSH SINHAL: Total 98. ## Building Capabilities Over Time ARVIND KOTHARI: And I thought that why is he approaching this? And the returns were okay, but they were not great. And in his business he was hitting the ball out of the park, right? And then I tried to discuss with him that at Niveshaay, we solved this piece long back, which you have a starting point. Since day one, you can be very good at investing because you’re a very good businessman. And I truly believe that getting mentorship from people like Vivek ji or from the entrepreneurs has helped me more than getting mentorship from people who are from the market. And that’s where we look at how over the years a capability is being built and capabilities don’t get built in a day or two. Capabilities take a decade to build. Look at whatever has happened, game changing in the world. The revenues or the profitability of the past decade have been dismal. They have been like, no one would have looked at that investment if they were talking about four, five years ago period. And they completely come to the hockey stick. And that is when the whole public is wanting to invest. And that is where I thought, can we have a bridge? Can we find these opportunities at the right juncture? And that’s where we started to go very deep down into sectors. We don’t invest in banking or mature sectors. We take up sectors where nothing might have happened but capability might have built up. And we’ve tried to find out that juncture where the hockey stick is going to maybe play out or maybe even betting when we feel that the capabilities are ripe now. Whether it delivers in two years, three years, five years, we don’t know. But I’m getting this opportunity now. I might not get it if I delay this. So that is where we over the years done a lot of work in a lot of sectors. And in 2019, 2020 when Covid hit, we had this huge, you can say, realization that the technologies which are going to lead our country to the future are something which are not being very well represented in the listed equity market. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: What do you mean by that, sir? ## The Power of Pattern Recognition in Investing ARVIND KOTHARI: By that, what I mean is that if I look at the biggest problem that Covid was trying to solve is that how everything can be delivered at home, how you can have a power supply and Internet connection and everything, the data can be transmitted easily because people were working remotely, right? And if you look at most of these technologies were in the US and nothing was there in India. But we had service providers, we had companies which were trying to build solutions around it, but most of them were not listed. What goals countries took after Covid was coming out is that our planet was breathing much better when Covid shutdowns were happening. So we need more clean energy. And if you look at in our country, we had the giants like NTPC and Tata Power all listed, but very few were talking about clean energy. That is where we realized that power sector is one sector or energy overhaul is one theme that will play out in multiple countries at the same time. Because of this requirements of data, because of this requirement of the greenhouse gases which were the goals that countries were. The first thing every country after Covid that came and said was that we have this net zero goal by 2030 or 35 or whatever. So that is where we try to link things. And that is where we thought that in our country we have solar energy policies which were in place. There was nothing in terms of, you can say, fixation of those policies which were very difficult to crack on ground because the power cost was already going down. And then there was a layer of export demand that came for equipment in our country because China was shut down. And there were a lot of problems that people thought in the western world that we cannot be importing a lot from China. So the whole supply chain rearrangement happened and India kind of became a bright spot where a lot of these turbines, solar panels, a lot of these engineering equipment was trying to be sourced from. And we do a very deep work into understanding the culture in India. We don’t have a very big culture of burning money like in the western world. It is there for technology. But we have a lot of engineering talent and that engineering talent. ## India’s Engineering Advantage We have produced engineering giants like L&T. We produce a lot of, you can say giants which are making gears, giants which are making a lot of these components which are engineering led. And that gives us a huge runway in terms of fitting that culture with the manufacturing ecosystem and bringing this whole power equipment piece alive. And that’s where we started investing in companies which were building components in solar like panels like you can say glass. And also then focusing on technology piece where we then understood that the whole transmission network needs an upgrade because the two way communication problem of the solar that is there, hence there will be a lot of transformer demand that will be there in the country. So when we were talking about transformer, a lot of investor friends of me told me, “Arvind, all these Baroda people, you know, there are hundreds of transformer companies every gully you go to Baroda, why this sector is investable. This has not made return for 10 years.” And then Elon Musk talks about that the biggest shortage that the world has seen will be in transformers, right? So these kind of things are very difficult to imagine if you’re a normal investor sitting in a Bombay or a Delhi office and just looking at the macro picture. You need a lot of data points on ground. How so many companies in transformer had gone bankrupt. What were the problems? What is the current need of transformer is multifold because of the upgrade that is being required in. And if someone read the policy document that the government was publicly sharing that what bids they were inviting in solar, what bids they were inviting in the transmission capacity, one could easily figure out. But the problem was the numbers were not there. ## The Smart Meter Opportunity Yeah, similar problem with smart meters. There was a lot of policy that the government brought and they were talking about these numbers that we had this 250 million people and we need to shift everything into smart meters. But the numbers were not coming. And hence people were having this disbelief. But that is where we thought that if there is an entrepreneur who is solving this problem, this is a 500 million meter problem by 2030 and 500 million meter in household where you can take data from them. We thought there can be a lot of layers. But the problem is that the existing players were thinking in a very mundane fashion. And when first time, you know, I got the Kimbal deck they were trying to raise money since almost a year. And they might have met some 30, 40 organizations. I guess they could not. No one felt that this was an exciting. And I initially three times my analysts came to me and told and I thought I have listed companies in this space. Why should I even look at Kimbal? But one very interesting piece that my analyst tried to influence me was that the only company which is working on the whole solution that is the smart meter also the communication and dissemination of the data. And that was something which was very powerful. And then. But again, I look at the numbers, I get discouraged when I decided let’s make a visit to this guy, understand what he’s doing. ## The First Meeting with Ayush And the first meeting when I was told that you could sometimes, you know, have to call tractors to, you know, enter that place. So when I entered Munka, I thought why should I even be spending time on this company which is based out of Munka, a small 10,000 square feet kind of a setup. You look people here and there. But I have figured out in my life is that if you can draw parallels, see, it is nothing you’re doing past analysis. Nothing is going to add value. What is the future if you can draw parallels that if something had happened in some other sector an entrepreneur trying to solve and what then eventually happened. So when I first met Ayush, his obsessiveness with smart meter as a solution was very hard hitting. And his obsessiveness with what solution he can deliver is the best solution that his consumer wants. Not just the utility but the consumer end consumer which I had not heard any company to talk about. And then I could relate that was Jeff Bezos also trying to do that. If someone visited Bezos back in 97, 98, he had this obsessive, you know, mindset that boss, I can so solve the problem of a book library. That cannot be done physically, I can do it digitally. So first I remember first time when we invested the monthly revenue was around 5 to 7 crores every month it was fluctuating. But the point is that every two, three months when we used to interact they were this bunch of energetic people. They could hire people from Tata Power, they could hire people from GE. They were bringing in talent which was unheard of. Again in my investing history I have heard that people who can draw talent are the entrepreneurs who built successful enterprises. So even though the data was not encouraging but the capability was getting built up. AYUSH SINHAL: No profit, no profits, but the capability. ARVIND KOTHARI: Was getting built up. One year down the line, again the profitability is elusive and my investors, Reggie is not asking but other investors are getting jittery. Boss, where are the profits? What is happening with the company? And then comes a time when they need capital. And again I’m visiting them with this mindset. Boss, we will provide capital. And out of the meeting I’m coming out boss, we can provide them even 200 crores because what they’re building is something phenomenal. And the good part was that me and could convince the other investors that this is a company which is building something which is very unique. Just don’t look at the profitability but the capability can highlight as a mentor because his role has been phenomenally there to build that profitability piece, to build that discipline, to build that mindset which a large company thinks about and how Kimbal as a startup can think like a large company. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: How did you do that, sir? ## The BCON Framework VIVEK JAIN: So the exciting part, you know one of our framework which we use in our investment now is called Beacons. Sorry BCON. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Okay. VIVEK JAIN: The BCON is like who’s showing the torch towards the. Like this. He’s one of that entrepreneur, right? So when we saw talk about BCON like it’s talk about the bold. The bold initiatives. I first met him, he came to my home, Arvindji called me that. Okay, let’s meet him. He called and I think so we. AYUSH SINHAL: Spoke for three to four hours and. VIVEK JAIN: The deal was done on the day, the same day. And in the morning 6am he had messaged me we are on and we can go avoid, right? So the decision making has to be very quick and has to be bold. That’s where Kimbal talks about. Then we talk about E is the ethics, the integrity, the integrity level at their company, their family. I checked it with my connect because as he was staying very close to my place so I could get some connect. The first thing the connect told me “Vivek bande dhi ghe kaan gya Garth you can invest money” and there the starting point comes out, right? And you know when we started to see the culture they’ve got ranked 34th in the great place to work recently. ARVIND KOTHARI: Oh wow. VIVEK JAIN: Coca Cola is 35. AYUSH SINHAL: 32. ## Building a World-Class Culture VIVEK JAIN: 32, right. The Coca Cola is 32. They are 34. A startup kind of a company getting that ranked in the country. And when you go to their culture I had happened to visit their, you know, their annual day and you know there are 400 people and you could see that there are 400 Ayush sitting there talking with such passion. I’m doing this, I’m doing this, I’m doing this. This I don’t find in my company. This is the culture they have built, right? And when we say that oh the BCON. Oh openness to the competition, you know, very interesting incident. I will tell you. I was, I was. They had a big exhibition in the greater Noida, right? And their Kimbal mega plant which is from 10,000 square feet now to 2 lakh square feet, two and a half lakh square feet they had built up and they had a bid exhibition. So I told me “Vivek, we have, you know planned that anybody who comes here can go to the visitor plant.” I asked him “come on hell, how can you do it? They can be competitors who will be there.” He said “what is the problem? Let them, let them go. We should be far ahead of competition. What they’re thinking today we have done it already.” So that is that the openness to competition is there, right? I missed the A part of it, you know, the BCON the A. The agility part. The agility and speed is. I still remember the incident we had invested in January 24. If that the first round, the 350 crore, right? And they took us some. They paid on the money and then they took us this greater node of the Kimbal mega plant before the rent started ticking in they’d already started production. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Wow. ## Speed and Innovation at Kimbal VIVEK JAIN: In. In, you get a period, right? You get a period to put up their place and all. They’d already started production, right. Whenever we go to their place now or we meet their team, there’s something new happening. As Arvind just now mentioned about they had this EMS piece coming in. I am sure that Kimbal is one company which will breed groom at least 25 more companies out of Kimbal in the similar sector solving different problems. Like one problem is the EMS, the data trading second piece they’ve already developed, which is the software which is on your mobile, which can actually tell you which is the device in your home, which can have a safety hazard. You know, we all worry that there can be fire at the home, right. If you are knowing in advance that this is your device which is not working on your app and in the app you can switch it off. Yeah, right. It is wonderful. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: That’s incredible, right? ## Investing in Speed and Innovation GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: That they’ve already built, right? Then they are also showing that this is the power guzzler in your home. And if you can run at the solar hours, you can save power. This is like helping the country. It’s not only making money, right? Making money is of course a byproduct. Now this kind of agility and speed, it’s like a big learning to us. How can Action Tessa bring that speed, right? That’s the fun part of it. And the second last piece is the end-to-end thought vision, right? They’re already thinking about what their competitors are doing. They have a proper system of benchmarking the competitors, what they are doing, what kind of product they have. Because finally we have to fight on the price also. So they have a big program running on the cost. And the cost is not just to reduce, it’s reverse engineering to innovate. Just for an example, in a smart meter they are able to make a smart meter in 38 seconds, 36 seconds. Right now they have pressure from the market that they want more production. But the space is constrained, already 2.5 flex wave, it is gone. Now they’re building up new space. Now their team, Anirudh, Ayush and their team has built up that they can reduce it to 18 seconds. That means double the production with no investment, right? So you can understand what kind of numbers they can throw in, right? And the second piece they are working heavily on is the quality piece, that the failure rate, because when a smart meter goes and installs at Ganesh’s home and it gets faulty, the discom is having a problem. AYUSH SINHAL: They cannot earn money. VIVEK JAIN: Yeah, they will tell the AMISP, “Boss, job now that is thousand bucks.” If their failure rate can go down, the job is done. Why would anybody, because the price will always fight. But the technology they are building, the quality they are building is enormous. So that is the kind of entrepreneurs we love to work with. ## Case Study: Betting on Undervalued Companies GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, can you walk me through three such examples where the companies on the outside were not doing well and you bet on those companies, you were bullish on those companies, you worked with those companies and eventually today they’ve paid you dividends far beyond people’s imaginations? ARVIND KOTHARI: So the first example that I can come up with is a company called HLE Glasscourt which in a way was a group which was unlisted. But they bought a company called Swiss Glass Coat which was listed on the exchanges in India. And they had 100 crores kind of a market cap. Now it was a very small company. 100 crore would not move the needle for much of the funds. And the reason why we got excited was that the promoter family was one of the friends of my cousin, which I knew them since almost seven, eight years. And their capability, I knew how they had built, how they think, how Alab, and he was a young engineer used to think and how he could bring that learnings to his own company and build that up. And now that he can do the same thing with the company that he’s acquired. And that is where a small company of 100 crores got a valuation of close to a billion dollars in the coming four or five years because they went into adjacencies, they reverse merged their own business with this listed company. So this company was making glass line reactors. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: What is that, sir? ARVIND KOTHARI: The glass line reactor is a reactor which pharma and chemical companies use to mix a lot of their chemicals and store it also. So here is a company which was just doing a turnover of 40, 50 crores. But the point is that when they merged these two entities, they had this lethal combination of a giant which can be a supplier of pharma and chemical plants. Almost 30% of the value chain was dryers, filters and glass line equipments. So all pharma giants or chemical giants had to come to this company whenever they were thinking of a plant. And in India we were going through this boom of chemicals and pharma because if you look at Gujarat or Hyderabad, most of these pharma giants were talking about 4x capacity, 5x capacity. Chemical plants were talking about 10x capacity because we had a capability in the country regarding these two manufacturing of materials. We thought a player like HLE in the merged form is on the forefront of supplying those critical equipment for this company, for this industry to grow. And that is where there was a time period then in 2019, there was a three years kind of waiting period. That waiting period increased to four, four and a half years in 2021. So the capability they were building, still they could not completely fulfill the needs of the consumer. [ALSO READ:Transcript: AI Safety Expert Dr. Roman Yampolskiy on The Diary Of A CEO Podcast](https://singjupost.com/transcript-ai-safety-expert-dr-roman-yampolskiy-on-the-diary-of-a-ceo-podcast/) And that is where Malabar kind of funds came into. Other funds came into when the company’s market cap fell to 3,000, 4,000 crores and it went to almost 8,000, 9,000 crores. And the capability of Alab as an engineer was something which drove me to take that bet. And that mindset created an organization which is one of the largest value creators if you think about in terms of a merger story that Indian corporate had ever spun. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: So you invested in this company when it was valued at 100 crores and today it is sitting at a valuation of 8,000 crores? ARVIND KOTHARI: At the top it went to around 8,000 crores. Today it might be around 4,000 crores. ## The Investment Framework GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Okay, got it. So sir, if I have to break down your framework, you first look at a megatrend, something like, let’s say PM Suryaghar Yojana, which is going to substantially increase the demand for a particular capability in India. Correct. So it could be about solar panels or it could be about glass lining equipment. Once you identify that, you go and scout for entrepreneurs or companies who have the capability to service this demand. And once you identify them, then you get into a framework, then there is another framework which then goes deeper from the entrepreneur all the way to the culture of the company, to the integrity of the company, to the energy of the people who are running the company. And on the basis of that you decide to invest in a particular company, not on the basis of the numbers but on the basis of the capability of the company to cater to a future demand. And that is where you’ve been able to experience hockey stick growth. Is that correct? ARVIND KOTHARI: Yes. Because if I’m betting on the numbers which are already there, why will the market reward me anything? Because if I’m already betting on a giant like Reliance which has already created thousands of crores of profitability, it will not move the needle if they create few thousand more crores of profitability because they’ve already been discovered by the market. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. Give me two more examples, sir. ## Case Study: Waaree Energies ARVIND KOTHARI: So the second company that we bet on is Waaree Energies which again if you think of, and we were thinking about that bet, it was in solar where India had no chance to succeed, right? China was the leader in that sector. And China was in a way dominating this space. Almost 90% of the equipment world over were Chinese equipment. And when the idea came to us, everyone again started, including Vivekji. First call, he was saying, “We buy panels in Microsoft, protect from Waaree and all these players, commodities and why commodities should get any value.” But what we observed is that here’s an entrepreneur who survived in an industry which was dominated by China, had no profitability or close to zero profitability. He himself went on the verge of getting drained of all his resources in the company twice. And he sold some other business of his that he had in engineering wall business which he sold to a European counterpart and brought capital to this company to make it survive. That is a passion that he carried for this business. And in COVID we remember that all the Chinese people had a force majeure clause on supplying to us panels to the US because the shipping cost just went through the roof. So everyone said we are not supplying. Here is a small company from India living up to the contracts and saying, “Forget about force majeure, forget about the losses I am going to supply, whatever loss, every container that I’m making.” And that is where he stood and delivered which no other company either in India or China delivered. And that is where he won the trust of the US counterparts. And this cannot be captured in numbers, right? Because when you talk about the US demand, there were a lot of Indian engineers who were there which were working in these EPC companies who were placing orders. They did not have a proper alternative to China for all these years. And hence they were not putting these orders and when we talk to them. So the main ingredient over here is generally investors don’t take stock of the situation on ground and what is it changing as a trend for the future. VIVEK JAIN: And also to add on the Waaree piece is what’s very important, Dharmeshji’s capital allocation and his time of equity raising was very particular because this was an industry not having profits. And that time, if you have a lot of debt on your book, you can be screwed. He was raising the equity in the right time and also doing the allocation at the right time. As investors generally we miss that. We just see numbers. Boss, understand the space, go talk to the founder, go talk to the market what’s happening and see if the situation is not improving for one year also, is there any problem? If the company can survive that tough time then the good times will come, then it will flourish. And this has happened in Waaree, right? This is happening in Kimbal now, right? ARVIND KOTHARI: And the ability that Vivekji is talking about, Hitesh Bhai raised capital of around 1,000 crores without any investment banker being appointed, without even a rupee of investment banking fees being paid. We raised close to around 180 crores in the company in two rounds. And when I just reached out to one of the family members that we raised this amount, we’re very happy with the investment. But if there can be a fees. So the feedback that I got, “We are not charging any fees.” I told, “Why will you charge a fees? You need to pay a fees to us to basically raising this capital.” But we were happy with the investment. AYUSH SINHAL: We did not make any money on the fees. ARVIND KOTHARI: But the investment was such superb that we were very excited and we went ahead. The point is that he was very clear that “I don’t want these kind of term sheets being written by these big investors and try to dominate of how I want to build my business. I have spent almost two decades understanding this business. I don’t want a third party to come and explain me that why are you making losses on this container that you’re shipping out to the US” because he was building a relationship. He was building a relationship which was going to last. And the point is that relationship helped him to have close to $1 billion in advances to build factories which now is around 14 gigawatts which is going to go to 20 gigawatts just in a year’s time. And the starting point was just a 500 megawatt factory to this 20 gigawatt factory spread across US, India. No other giant like Adani could even fathom doing that. And that is where he started to serve the US market. That was our thesis. India market was commodity and Waaree at least will make money out of that from things turning the table and India policy then going live and ALM ticking in where Indian government told that, completely changing the India business for them. So point is that betting on right things gave unimaginable opportunity in India itself. And now India is talking about energy storage and Waaree is talking about energy storage. India is talking about green hydrogen, Waaree is talking about green hydrogen. So they have transformers, everything. In fact, that is a beauty about these great founders. Again that I am repeating in the sake of it, but that is the building blocks that they find adjacencies and are able to replicate the same success in the other adjacencies. VIVEK JAIN: And also leave money on the table. Yeah, all these founders like Hiteshji and even Kimbal, they have always left money on the table for the investors. This is also crucial because if the founder is only thinking that “I should have the whole piece of the cake,” then the investors of course will not back them, right. Hiteshji and Kimbal of course have been doing that, right. And we have seen other founders also who have been quite successful that they have to take everybody along in the growth story. That is also important. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: You entered Waaree at a market cap of 4,500 crores and today it is sitting at a market cap of 80,000 crores. So that’s almost a 20x return. That’s insane. And the last company, sir, the third? ## The Power of Long-Term Thinking in Investment ARVIND KOTHARI: Company, or I can say again an ecosystem, again with the same mindset that we bet on was the electronic manufacturing in the country where there are multiple companies that we bet. But again, China is the leader over there. We cannot compete with China and the other southeastern nations and we don’t have an ecosystem, some things like that. But if you look at the Indian imports, the second item after oil was electronics. And that is where the government was framing policies that how we can become a self-sustaining nation in electronics. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: How much was the return that you generated from this? ARVIND KOTHARI: So Aventel would be at what, 2000% up for us. Maybe HBL was 700% up for us. That’s a kind of multiplier that we’ve made. But we’ve been lucky that these companies delivered what we thought and delivered much more than we thought. See, I did not imagine that Kimbal would be doing an EMS so successfully or would be executing so successfully or a 2000 crore kind of a business in a single year. It’s something very unique that they’ve built. Maybe something very unique that the order book that came to worry or HBL getting Kavach orders. This was something which we just hoped and some things we didn’t even hope came out of the blue. But betting on the right set of people and the right set of sector was something at a valuation gave us a lot of returns. ## Key Investment Advice for Multi-Bagger Returns GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. Sir, if you were to sum up your entire thesis and give out one takeaway to all the investors who are looking for these multi-baggers, what would your research advice be? ARVIND KOTHARI: So I have always thought through that. We’ve discussed this with my team also that what is our thesis, what do we bet on and how do we come across this serendipity where we come across companies like Kimbal or Worry. And what we figured out that thinking long term and focusing on creating relationships for the long term is one thing that has helped us a lot. We are never focused in a very myopic way to think at a relationship and approach someone with what profits we are going to make in a quarter or this year or that year. But the most value add has been from relationships like these. And that’s how we started to back companies together. And that’s what equity investors today are just focusing on what the listed world is. And they will just go to a company and look at the revenue projection this and then invest. They don’t go behind the story. Going behind the story is where entrepreneurs come into picture where a leader in the space can guide you towards that, how he thinks about the business or some supplier or some value chain guy can tell you about what the credibility of that person is. And that we use a lot in the entrepreneur circle that we’ve built to frame that whether this company has a good future, has good relationships, has good ethics and has good culture or not, which in a way very few. If you look at any research note which is spanned out by, I mean you have 200 companies in India who do wealth management or there are maybe 500 brokers, all brokerage reports talk about this is the current market price, this is our target. I mean I in my journey have never been able to figure out how I can decide a target of a company because I just enter into from that learning experience that how this business is right now, what it can become few years down the line. And there’s a journey that we are going together with no target in mind. And that is what I guess investors should always look at: thinking long term, not having targets in mind, enjoying the journey and trying to figure out what they’re betting on, whom they’re betting on is the right person or not. And that has been again a theory that we have been being with Kimbal, being able to learn even more. That’s why I’m saying both side of the table have value added us a lot. Because before Kimbal we just used to think that we are in the right direction or not. After Kimbal we get this validation that yes, thinking about these things do matter. These are the things that we need to now incorporate more in our thesis when we are picking the next investment because we are wanting to add more value rather than just money. Betting on just stock prices is not what we want to stand for. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. ARVIND KOTHARI: That is what as a learning outcome I believe investors or even youngsters can have when they’re thinking about business relationships, about investing, about anything in their life. Thinking long term is one thing that I’ve learned from Buffett and Munger and which is a learning lesson for my life that I keep on wanting to explore more. ## Addressing the Smart Meter Controversy GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Understood. Ayush, the last question that I want to ask you is about the controversy about smart meters. And Teju just told me that there are people in Gujarat complaining that their bill was about 6,000 rupees and now it’s suddenly jumping up to 60,000 rupees. So that’s wild, right? And that defeats the purpose of having a smart meter which is to measure the power consumption accurately. So how do you respond to that? AYUSH SINHAL: See, couple of things. One, such a mass rollout of smart metering or a replacement drivers never happened in the world ever, right? In India we’re replacing 150,000 smart meters daily. So definitely there has been lot of challenges, there have been a lot of mistakes and every entity in this particular, every stakeholder in this particular game has learned from that. And today the solution has matured. Earlier there were so many cases that you were getting energy bill of different consumer. So there’s a meter number, there’s a serial number like 1, 2, 3 and your consumer number. Every accounting happens, every energy billing happens on your consumer number. Whereas the meter is sending data on 1, 2, 3 if the mapping is wrong. So you’ll be getting the energy bill of some other consumers and some other consumer will be getting a from someone else, right. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: So you think that the systems will get better with time. AYUSH SINHAL: Yes, the system is getting better with time. VIVEK JAIN: Right. AYUSH SINHAL: So the example that you’re giving us in Gujarat, what has happened initially was they as soon as the smart metering was implemented, they had added all the errors, all the previous undue charges into the smart metering account. At the first go itself, if you’re not able to pay that, then your electricity gets disconnected. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. AYUSH SINHAL: So that, and it was just for around 1% or 2% of the consumer. But that 1% or 2% of the consumer spreads like anything, that message spreads like anything that after installing the smart meter, the bill inflates. Whereas the measurement is far better than previous one, so it is way more accurate, is way more secure. ## Final Words of Wisdom for Investors GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Understood. Vivek sir, do you have a final word to give out to the investors? VIVEK JAIN: Yeah. So in my learning and my experience, I’m sharing from the experience that you have to be patient. You have to look at the right space and be with the entrepreneur for some time. Give him the space. Any business has a sine wave kind of thing. It can go up and go down. Just do not see, okay, this quarter is bad, let’s exit. And also when an equity investor is listening to the con calls because a smaller investor may not have the ability to connect to the founder but he’s listening to con calls. Understand the tone behind it. The tone changes a lot as the company progresses. And if you’re right in there, you will make a hell lot of money. And as we told in the earlier thing also that money is the byproduct. The process should be right. Which is about the Gita also. Gita also talks about the same thing. Focus on the process, results will follow you. That’s what I believe. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Thank you so much, sir. ARVIND KOTHARI: So. ## Recap and Key Takeaways GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Here’s a summary of our discussion today. Firstly, Arvind sir, you mentioned that we have three problems in India. Firstly, in spite of being the fifth largest producer of coal for the longest time we had been importing coal. Secondly, we also have T&D losses, transmission and distribution losses because of which we are losing out on a lot of money. And Ayush, you gave out a very simple analogy where you said that it’s almost like having a pipe full of water but having a massive leakage in between because of which you’re losing out on water and you’re suffering because of lack of water. That’s exactly what’s happening to India. And you mentioned we are losing 2% of our GDP worth of money into just T&D losses and energy losses which can be solved for. And lastly we spoke about the broken grid infrastructure. It’s broken because nobody anticipated the consumption of energy to go up so quickly. And because we are such a huge country, this is something that needs to be fixed. And the evolution is happening very, very quickly. Then we spoke about the supply chain of how power is produced and distributed. Where we spoke about how coal is sourced by Coal India then goes to power generation companies, then goes to power transmission companies, then goes to power distribution companies or discoms and then goes to the traders like Adani Power and Tata Power who then bring power to the households of India, to the industries of India. And here’s where we spoke about the inefficiency. The major inefficiency lies with the discoms because they’re incurring thousands of crores of losses. And one of the biggest reasons for that was T&D losses. And that is where you found an opportunity with smart meters. Like you mentioned, you are a usual hostile kid who did not bother to pay electricity bills, found a gap in the market, discovered that manually discoms had to send somebody to check the reading of your meter, find out if you paid the electricity bill or not. And they were being paid 10 rupees per meter which was nothing for doing something so tedious. And that is where you realized that there must be a smarter way to collect this data and fix this leakage in such a way that you can figure out how much power is being consumed, you can regulate the power consumption and most importantly, you can make this entire process efficient where if somebody is not paying the electricity bill, you can cut off the supply without practically sending someone all the way to your house. And that is where you found the opportunity with smart meters. ## The Solar Revolution and Smart Meters And what we also discussed, Arvind sir, is about the rise of solar. After PM Suryaghar Yojana, the solar revolution in India has picked up and that has also given an opportunity for the smart meter market. Because now we are transitioning from a grid infrastructure where electricity comes from one source to the households to another model where households themselves are producing electricity. Which means there’s a two way transmission that’s happening. If two way transmission has to happen, it cannot operate with the existing meters. You need smart meters which can measure the inflow and outflow of power which is again turning into an advantage for a company like Kimbal. We spoke about two emerging opportunities over here. One is in the battery space and the other is in the smart meter space where Vivek ji, you mentioned that power is perishable. If you don’t find a way to store it, it’ll be of no use to you in some time. So there’ll be a huge demand for batteries and there’ll be a huge demand for smart meters because India will require 500 million smart meters by 2030. And one of the reasons why the solar revolution has picked up so quickly is because Arvind sir, you mentioned that from 2009 to 2025, the cost of producing power via solar has gone down from 21 rupees per unit to 1.6 rupees per unit at the same time because the power consumption in India has shot up and the grid is not able to take it up. Solar becomes the perfect energy source to be able to generate power in a decentralized manner so that we can cater to the demand of the Indian consumers. At the same time we can make sure that our existing infrastructure does not break. And that’s where we spoke about the next hundred villages in India that could be electrified because of a decentralized solar grid that could power those particular villages. ## Smart Meters vs Traditional Meters And then we spoke about the difference between a smart meter and a dumb meter. Ayush, you mentioned that smart meter can help you with three things: regulation, calculation and efficiency. If that is done then the discoms will largely benefit because the T&D losses can go down. We can figure out where the leakage is happening and we can go and fix it. And because you have a full stack service all the way from product to the data analysis, you are helping discoms and large companies figure out where the leakage is so that they can fix it. More importantly, you’ve done that inefficient process of just going and looking at every meter and reading them into an efficient process which looks very simple on the outside. But I’m sure it must be very, very difficult where you helped these companies figure out the people who are not paying electricity bills just like yourself and you help them get rid of this. And that’s why you also mentioned the cases in Gujarat, right where if the bill comes out to be 60,000, that’s not because the smart meter is not working. That could also be because the bill that they’ve got is a compilation of all the other unpaid bills that were left out which have now come in submission to look like an exorbitant bill of 60,000 rupees. ## Investment Thesis and Stock Picking Strategy Then Arvind sir, we spoke about your investment thesis and how you pick winning stocks. You’ve been able to generate 2000% return and 700% return which on the outset seems like a bet gone right. But you walked us through an in depth process of how you pick these companies. And that’s where we spoke about a model where you look at a megatrend, for example the PM Suryaghar Yojana, you look at the future demand that is going to occur because of that megatrend. In this case it could be the increase in demand for solar panels. And then you go and scout for companies which have the capability to cater to that future demand. Those companies may not be doing well today, but in the coming decade they will become beneficiaries of the megatrend. Eventually they’ll go on to become super profitable companies. As a result, they will deliver returns for you. So you don’t study the numbers. You study the story behind the numbers. You study the market and how conducive it’s going to get in the future so that it can benefit a certain cohort of companies. And that’s why we spoke about Waaree, we spoke about Kimbal. And after finding these companies, you look for energy, integrity and agility. And if the culture of the company is insanely good, if the founder has infectious enthusiasm to solve their problem, then you bet on those companies, you stick with them. And that’s where you get people like Vivek ji who can mentor these companies in such a way that they can accelerate the progress of these companies to then fit your thesis of they becoming a beneficiary of the megatrend. ## Final Takeaways From Ayush, I would say the most important takeaway is to look for the smallest gaps that you can identify in your life. Because those gaps may appear to be very small to you, but at scale there could be billion dollar gaps which if addressed can help you build large companies. Like you said, power seems to be a boring sector. But if enough people get into the space and solve for the existing problems in the space, there are several million dollar, billion dollar companies that could emerge because of addressing this gap. From Arvind ji, the most important takeaway for me is to not study the numbers, but the story behind the numbers. And from Vivek ji, what I’ve understood is that you spoke about patient capital. ARVIND KOTHARI: Right? GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: And that is something that very few people understand. Everybody speaks about patient capital but they don’t understand what patient capital means. We’re not talking about patience over a few quarters, but over a few decades which will help you become a beneficiary of the India growth story. And you gave very good examples of Waaree Energy as well as Kimbal where you stuck to the company for a very long time to then see it progress and not just see it as a transaction where you just simply invest money and hope that in the next three months your money will double. Basically double, but 2000%, 700% return. So don’t just look at the numbers, but study the story behind the numbers. Does that sum up our conversation, guys? AYUSH SINHAL: Perfect. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Yes, perfect. Thank you so much, guys. VIVEK JAIN: Thank you. ARVIND KOTHARI: Thank you so much. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Thank you. ### Related Posts - [Transcript: Sam Shamoun’s Interview on PBD Podcast](https://singjupost.com/transcript-sam-shamouns-interview-on-pbd-podcast/) - [Transcript: Lina Khan on The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart](https://singjupost.com/transcript-lina-khan-on-the-weekly-show-with-jon-stewart/) - [Transcript: Behavior Expert Chase Hughes on Shawn Ryan Show (SRS #253)](https://singjupost.com/transcript-behavior-expert-chase-hughes-on-shawn-ryan-show-srs-253/) - [Transcript: Security Expert Gavin de Becker on Joe Rogan Podcast #2411](https://singjupost.com/transcript-security-expert-gavin-de-becker-on-joe-rogan-podcast-2411/) - [Comedian Dave Smith on TRIGGERnometry Podcast (Transcript)](https://singjupost.com/comedian-dave-smith-on-triggernometry-podcast-transcript/) Continue Reading - [Share](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsingjupost.com%2Findias-dirty-secret-how-is-the-power-crisis-paralysing-india-how-to-fix-it-transcript%2F&t=India%E2%80%99s%20Dirty%20Secret%3A%20How%20is%20the%20Power%20Crisis%20Paralysing%20India%3F%20How%20To%20Fix%20It%3F%20%28Transcript%29) - [Tweet](https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=India%E2%80%99s%20Dirty%20Secret%3A%20How%20is%20the%20Power%20Crisis%20Paralysing%20India%3F%20How%20To%20Fix%20It%3F%20%28Transcript%29&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsingjupost.com%2Findias-dirty-secret-how-is-the-power-crisis-paralysing-india-how-to-fix-it-transcript%2F&via=singjupost) - Pinterest - [Email](mailto://singjupost.com?subject=India%E2%80%99s%20Dirty%20Secret%3A%20How%20is%20the%20Power%20Crisis%20Paralysing%20India%3F%20How%20To%20Fix%20It%3F%20%28Transcript%29&body=https%3A%2F%2Fsingjupost.com%2Findias-dirty-secret-how-is-the-power-crisis-paralysing-india-how-to-fix-it-transcript%2F) [previousThe Minds of Modern AI: Jensen Huang, Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun & the AI Vision of the Future (Transcript)](https://singjupost.com/the-minds-of-modern-ai-jensen-huang-geoffrey-hinton-yann-lecun-the-ai-vision-of-the-future-transcript/) [nextTranscript: Piers Morgan On UK Migrant Crisis & Tommy Robinson – PBD Podcast 682](https://singjupost.com/transcript-piers-morgan-on-uk-migrant-crisis-tommy-robinson-pbd-podcast-682/) Scroll ↑ Top",

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

What the breach of cybersecurity firm KnownSec revealed\") ## Reperesntative image of a hacker and the logo of KnownSec are shown in this combo image**Photograph: (Others)** Story highlights ## A major data breach at Chinese firm KnownSec is giving a glimpse into how China is spying on Asian rivals including India using cyber tools. Besides several hacking programmes, state-linked cyber operations across more than 20 nations were revealed. One of China’s most important cybersecurity firms has been breached, revealing information about India stored on its servers. The hack revealed that KnownSec had data on the immigration records of India. The incident, which came to light earlier this month, exposed files that reportedly included details of state-aligned hacking operations across more than 20 countries. As per cyber security experts, the data is a rare glimpse into China's offensive cyber capabilities and the role of private firms in state-directed operations. ## KnownSec breach: What was leaked? The breach reportedly involved the leak of over 12,000 internal documents from KnownSec’s secure servers. It contained blueprints and source code for advanced malware, remote access tools and device-based attack kits, according to cybersecurity analysts. It allegedly included programmes that can access chat histories from WeChat, QQ and Telegram. There were also hardware implants disguised as USB chargers, such as malicious power banks. The files, released on the web, contained lists of targets spanning Asia, Europe and Africa, with India, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the UK featuring prominently.

It allegedly contained archives of Indian immigration data and digital infrastructure maps. One spreadsheet allegedly contained records of 95 gigabytes of Indian immigration data, possibly stolen in 2024. Security analysts who examined the breach found that China had a long-term interest in Indian government networks and border systems. ## What is KnownSec? Founded in 2007, KnownSec is a private cybersecurity firm known to have collaborated with Chinese government agencies on digital defence projects. Deeply embedded in national cyber initiatives, KnownSec’s well-known products include the ZoomEye internet scanning engine, used for network reconnaissance. In January this year, the US Department of Defence blacklisted dozens of Chinese companies operating in the US that it claimed are part of the People’s Republic of China’s military apparatus. KnownSec, formally known as Beijing Zhidao Chuangyu Information Technology Co., Ltd, was one of them.

Instead, it may have been an insider job or the work of an ideological actor. China has not officially acknowledged the breach, calling reports “groundless”, and KnownSec has issued no public statement. Leaked internal memos circulating online hinted at internal containment efforts by the company. Cybersecurity analysts warned that the exposure could have lasting effects, as the files could be repurposed by criminal or state groups. For India, the leas show the need for stronger cyber defence. ## Related Stories * [ ### China Blames U.S. for $13 Billion Bitcoin Heist | ‘State-Level Hack,’ Says Beijing ![China Blames U.S. for $13 Billion Bitcoin Heist | ‘State-Level Hack,’ Says Beijing ](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251112/1211_CHINA_9PM-00000002.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/videos/china-blames-u-s-for-13-billion-bitcoin-heist-state-level-hack-says-beijing-1762973624967) * [ ### UK Plans Tougher Cyber Security Laws | Govt Moves to Protect Public Services from Cyberattacks ![UK Plans Tougher Cyber Security Laws | Govt Moves to Protect Public Services from Cyberattacks ](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251112/1211_UK_230PM-00000002.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/videos/uk-plans-tougher-cyber-security-laws-govt-moves-to-protect-public-services-from-cyberattacks-1762942097936) * [ ### China accuses US of $14 billion Bitcoin theft: How is LuBian hack linked to &#x27;pig butchering scam&#x27; and Chen Zhi? ![China accuses US of $14 billion Bitcoin theft: How is LuBian hack linked to &#x27;pig butchering scam&#x27; and Chen Zhi?](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251112/image-1762932129957.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/world/china-accuses-us-of-14-billion-bitcoin-theft-how-is-lubian-hack-linked-to-pig-butchering-scam-and-chen-zhi-1762932085945) * [ ### Anupama Parameswaran files cyber-crime complaint against 20-year-old woman; know why ![Anupama Parameswaran files cyber-crime complaint against 20-year-old woman; know why](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251109/image-1762673253593.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/entertainment/anupama-parameswaran-files-cyber-crime-complaint-against-20-year-old-woman-know-why-1762673103332) * [ ### Anupama Parameswaran files cyber-crime complaint against 20-year-old woman; know why ![Anupama Parameswaran files cyber-crime complaint against 20-year-old woman; know why](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251109/image-1762673253593.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/entertainment/anupama-parameswaran-files-cyber-crime-complaint-against-20-year-old-woman-know-why-1762673103332) * [ ### Nikkei Hit by Major Cyberattack After Employee Error | 17,000 Records Exposed in Slack Breach ![Nikkei Hit by Major Cyberattack After Employee Error | 17,000 Records Exposed in Slack Breach](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251105/0511_sumit_japan_330pm-00000002.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/videos/nikkei-hit-by-major-cyberattack-after-employee-error-17-000-records-exposed-in-slack-breach-1762348981256) * [ ### British clothes company Marks and Spencer&#x27;s profits plummet due to cyberattack ![British clothes company Marks and Spencer&#x27;s profits plummet due to cyberattack](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251105/image-1762347407053.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/business-economy/british-clothes-company-marks-and-spencer-s-profits-plummet-due-to-cyberattack-1762346526023) * [ ### India-Israel: Israel FM Concludes Two-Day India Visit, Calls India A &#x27;Special Country&#x27; ![India-Israel: Israel FM Concludes Two-Day India Visit, Calls India A &#x27;Special Country&#x27;](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251105/0511_gideon_11AM-00000002.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/videos/india-israel-israel-fm-concludes-two-day-india-visit-calls-india-a-special-country-1762328284738) * [ ### Israel&#x27;s FM Gideon Sa’ar hopes direct flight with India will be restarted ![Israel&#x27;s FM Gideon Sa’ar hopes direct flight with India will be restarted](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251104/image-1762278359416.jpeg) ](https://www.wionews.com/world/israel-s-fm-gideon-sa-ar-hopes-direct-flight-with-india-will-be-restarted-1762278147392) * [ ### US Cyber Experts Charged for Running Massive Ransomware Scheme ![US Cyber Experts Charged for Running Massive Ransomware Scheme](https://cdn1.wionews.com/prod/wion/images/2025/20251104/0411_CYBER_230PM-00000002.jpg) ](https://www.wionews.com/videos/us-cyber-experts-charged-for-running-massive-ransomware-scheme-1762250877423) ### About the Author [![Vinod Janardhanan](https://unified-cms.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/wion/author/images/2025/20250911/image-1757575501360.jpeg?imwidth=53&amp;imheight=53)](/author/vinod-janardhanan) ### [Vinod Janardhanan](/author/vinod-janardhanan) [![Share on twitter](https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/static/public/wion-images/twitter-icon.svg)](https://x.com/vinodjanardanan)[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-vinod-janardhanan-87418622/) ### [Vinod Janardhanan](/author/vinod-janardhanan) Vinod Janardhanan, PhD writes on international affairs, defence, Indian news, entertainment and technology and business with special focus on artificial intelligence.

    "full_text": "# US–China Cyber Relations and the Weaponisation of Microsoft Platforms - November 11, 2025 \\| - [Issue Brief](https://www.idsa.in/publication-type/issuebrief) ## **_Summary_** _Cyber tensions between the United States and China show Microsoft’s central yet fragile role in global cybersecurity, where its platforms serve as both assets and targets. While both nations have exploited vulnerabilities within the platform to conduct cyber-espionage against each other, China has been particularly persistent in its operations._ ## **Introduction** Accusations of state-sponsored cyber espionage have come to define the cyber relations between the US and China over the years. The widespread adoption of Microsoft products has also made them prime targets for state-sponsored cyber espionage. High-profile incidents, such as the SolarWinds breach and attacks on Microsoft 365, have demonstrated how nation-state actors exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s ecosystem to conduct sophisticated espionage operations. The same tactics have been deployed by both the US and China, deepening mistrust and diplomatic friction between the two. [\\[1\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn1) In recent years, China, in particular, has increasingly weaponised vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s platforms to execute espionage and influence operations.\\ ## **Historical Overview of US–China Cyber Relations** The trajectory of US–China cyber relations reflect a history of mutual espionage, strategic mistrust and technological competition. Since China’s formal entry into the global Internet in 1994, cyberspace has emerged as a critical domain of tensions between the two powers. [\\[2\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn2) What began as isolated intrusions has expanded into a repeated cycle of cyber espionage, countermeasures and retaliatory diplomacy. Though both China and the US have used cyberspace to gain strategic, economic and military advantages, China’s campaigns, particularly those exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft systems, have been more frequent and globally disruptive. For more than a decade, China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have launched cyber espionage campaigns targeting US government agencies, critical infrastructure, defence contractors and technology firms. For example, the 2005 Titan Rain cyber-attacks, which compromised the unclassified networks of the US Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Energy, stand out as an essential incident. [\\[3\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn3) Titan Rain represented the first publicly disclosed case of state-sponsored cyber espionage originating from China, and marked the first instance in which the US government publicly attributed such activities to Chinese state actors. Another prominent example is the 2009 Operation Aurora, a series of cyberattacks that compromised the networks of Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, and other high-profile companies to steal their trade secrets. [\\[4\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn4) This prompted Google to close its offices and operations in China. The China threat became so evident that, in 2011, the US government’s Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive issued a report naming China as the “most active and persistent” perpetrator of cyber intrusions into the United States. [\\[5\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn5) However, the US has not been passive in cyberspace—it has also conducted numerous cyber operations against Chinese networks and institutions. American intelligence, especially the National Security Agency (NSA), has used cyberspace for a long time to monitor and penetrate strategically. China has consistently claimed that the US is a leading perpetrator of cyberattacks and alleges tens of thousands of intrusions every year on Chinese systems. [\\[6\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn6) In fact, independent research supports the view that a significant volume of global cyber activity originates from or transits through the US-based infrastructure, facilitated by major American Internet service providers. Microsoft’s dominance in both public and private sectors made its software a primary target for advanced persistent threats. As the world’s largest provider of enterprise software, cloud infrastructure and productivity tools, Microsoft products such as Exchange, SharePoint, and Outlook underpin critical operations for governments, corporations and NGOs worldwide. This makes Microsoft a prime target for state and non-state actors seeking to penetrate sensitive networks, conduct cyber-espionage, or carry out disruptive attacks. The historical evolution serves as an essential reference point for better understanding the present stage of US–China cyber competition, in which Microsoft has become both the _battleground_ and the _barometer_ of their technological and strategic contest. The following cases illustrate how China, in particular, has weaponised Microsoft’s ecosystem. The three contemporary cases involving Hafnium, Antique Typhoon, and the combined efforts of Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm 2603 highlight a clear pattern that has been unfolding for years. They show how China’s cyber espionage tactics have not only increased but also grown more advanced and precise over time. These recent cases also highlight a transition from broad, data-theft-oriented attacks of the past to exact, zero-day-driven operations. ## **Chinese Cyber Operations Targeting the US via Microsoft Platforms** Serving as a critical gateway to US government, corporate and institutional networks, Microsoft offers Chinese actors a high-value “window” for espionage and economic theft. Because its tools are so widely adopted, and because many of them manage privileged access, hold private keys, or broker identity/trust, vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s systems are highly attractive. An exploit can give adversaries far-reaching potential: infiltrate multiple organisations simultaneously, move laterally within networks, exfiltrate intellectual property, observe or manipulate decision-makers, or launch ransomware. Chinese threat groups have repeatedly exploited these weaknesses, as evidenced in the cases discussed below. The following sections discuss key instances of Chinese cyber operations targeting Microsoft, intended to gather intelligence and advance strategic interests against the United States. Table 1 outlines the attack timeline, the identified Chinese threat actor, the attack target, the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used, the attack objective, and Microsoft’s corresponding patching or mitigation measures. ## **_2021 Hafnium Cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange Servers_** Hafnium, a threat group believed to be state-sponsored and operating in China, launched several cyberattacks on Microsoft Exchange Servers in January 2021. The attack exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, 26857, 26858 and 27065). [\\[7\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn7) By February, the incident had escalated into one of the most significant cyber incidents in recent history: approximately a quarter of a million systems worldwide were exposed, predominantly small and medium-sized businesses and organisations, with at least 30,000 confirmed compromises. What initially appeared to be targeted espionage quickly transformed into a widespread “smash-and-grab” operation. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Centre attributed the attack to a Chinese state-sponsored actor based on observed tactics and procedures. [\\[8\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn8) The Biden administration later publicly accused China, attributing the operation to cyber actors connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and stated that it had exploited zero-day vulnerabilities that Microsoft subsequently patched in March. China, however, firmly rejected these allegations. Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responded to the US-led accusations by stating that the United States, along with its allies, has fabricated allegations against China regarding cybersecurity, with no factual basis. [\\[9\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn9) Hafnium is known to target entities in the US across various industry sectors, including law firms, infectious disease researchers, higher education institutions, policy think tanks, defence contractors and NGOs, reflecting a broad, strategic focus on intelligence collection. ## **_2023 Antique Typhoon Breaching Email Accounts Incident_** In May 2023, Antique Typhoon, a Chinese state-backed threat actor previously tracked by Microsoft as _Storm-0558_, carried out a cyber intrusion that compromised email accounts at roughly two dozen organisations across the United States and Europe, including the US Department of Commerce. Among those targeted were Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and several members of the House of Representatives. [\\[10\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn10) China firmly denied the allegations, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accusing the US of engaging in its own hacking activities and labelling the Microsoft report as “highly unprofessional” and “disinformation”. Active since at least August 2021, Storm-0558 is a cyber-espionage group linked to China that specialises in stealing credentials through phishing, manipulating OAuth tokens and forging authentication credentials to infiltrate the email systems of targeted organisations. [\\[11\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn11) The group primarily targets government institutions in the United States and Europe, with a strategic focus on entities and individuals involved in geopolitical matters related to Taiwan and Uyghur interests. ## **_2025 Microsoft SharePoint Exploitation by Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm 2603_** In a recent cyberattack, three threat groups, suspected to be Chinese government-affiliated, exploited zero-day vulnerabilities to target Microsoft SharePoint servers. [\\[12\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn12) Several organisations across sectors, including government, critical infrastructure and education, have been impacted in countries such as the United States, Germany and Australia. The US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was among the organisations breached. However, reports suggest that no sensitive or classified information has been compromised. The identified threat groups include Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon and Storm-2603. Typhoon is a term Microsoft uses to designate Chinese nation-state threat groups, while Storm is a term it uses to refer to threat groups in development. China rejected the allegations, with Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US, emphasising that cyberattacks are a global challenge that affects all countries, and that China is also a target of such threats. [\\[13\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn13) He reiterated the nation’s “consistent and clear” stance, underscoring that China firmly opposes all forms of cyberattacks and actively combats cybercrime. Linen Typhoon, active since 2012, primarily targets government, defence, strategic and human rights organisations to steal intellectual property, according to Microsoft. [\\[14\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn14) Violet Typhoon, identified in 2015, conducts espionage against former officials, NGOs, think tanks, universities, media and sectors like finance and healthcare across the US, Europe and East Asia. Meanwhile, Storm-2603, another China-based actor, has been observed trying to steal MachineKeys from compromised SharePoint servers. While much of the focus has been on China’s offensive cyber operations, it is essential to recognise that exploitation of Microsoft systems is not one-sided—the US has also exploited Microsoft as a platform to target China to steal intelligence and conduct cyber espionage. However, such instances have been less direct and less frequent. For example, the Vault 7 CIA leak exposed how the CIA developed and deployed malware, backdoors and custom hacking tools to compromise operating systems like Microsoft Windows to penetrate computers and networks used by foreign targets, including Chinese government agencies and commercial entities. [\\[15\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn15) However, Vault 7 was not specifically directed at China; it revealed cyber tools and operations targeting multiple regions, including Europe, the Middle East and China. In a recent development, China’s 2025 accusation against the US alleged that American agencies exploited unpatched Microsoft security flaws to spy on Chinese military networks, reflecting ongoing tit-for-tat cyber operations. [\\[16\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn16) Unlike the Chinese cases, where detailed objectives, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of Microsoft exploitation have been documented, the 2025 Microsoft bug incident has not been confirmed or detailed by either Microsoft or the US government. This shows that Chinese operations are explicitly oriented towards espionage against Western entities, particularly the US, highlighting the asymmetry in targeting focus between US and Chinese cyber activities involving Microsoft vulnerabilities. ## **Cyber Crisis Management** The repeated cycles of accusation and denial following these Microsoft-related breaches reveal a deeper structural problem in US–China cyber relations: the absence of effective cyber crisis management frameworks. While cyber operations have become increasingly sophisticated, mechanisms to contain their diplomatic fallout remain underdeveloped. Crisis management in cyberspace involves controlling and mitigating cyber incidents that can escalate into tensions between countries, armed conflict, or war. The objective is to prevent cyberspace confrontations from escalating into a full-fledged war. Though disputes in cyberspace are low-intensity and involve limited confrontation, the need for cyber crisis stems from the recent rise in full-scale confrontation triggered by cyberspace conflicts between countries. [\\[17\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn17) One of the most critical objectives of crisis management is the establishment of shared attribution protocols and norms. [\\[18\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn18) Joint technical teams should develop transparent, mutually-agreed processes for attributing attacks and reducing the “who-did-it” ambiguity that fuels retaliation. Attribution has, in fact, proved to be a significant challenge in US–China cyber crisis management. China’s increasing sophistication of cyber threat actors over the years has made it difficult to attribute specific attacks to specific actors. This uncertainty makes it difficult for governments to respond to or diplomatically address the situation quickly. Clear communication channels for de-escalating cyber crises are essential for cyber crisis management in the US–China context. [\\[19\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn19) Historically, the absence of direct lines of dialogue during cyber incidents has frequently led to misunderstandings and tensions. Bilateral dialogue mechanisms have also seen limited success. For instance, the US–China Cyber Agreement in 2015 did not fully succeed in reducing the number of cyberattacks, especially in the long term. US cybersecurity experts observed a sudden decline in Chinese cyberattacks after the 2015 agreement. However, they assigned four possible reasons for this decline—the first is the advancement in carrying out sophisticated cyberattacks which are challenging to be detected in cyberspace; second could be China’s use of proxies in other countries to target victims in the US; third could be China’s redirecting of attacks to other countries; and fourth could be that the agreement actually helped in putting a stop in Chinese cyberattacks by conducting an anti-corruption campaign in the government and PLA after signing the contract. Similarly, the US–China Cyber Working Group saw limited success mainly due to mutual mistrust and differing national interests. These past bilateral efforts to institutionalise dialogue, such as the 2015 US–China Cyber Agreement and the US–China Cyber Working Group, demonstrate both the potential and the fragility of cyber crisis management. When formal diplomatic channels fail during periods of tension, academic and civil exchanges play a crucial role in sustaining dialogue. Platforms such as the China–US Internet Forum (2007) and the Cyber Security Track-2 Dialogue (2009) have been successful in building mutual understanding and easing mistrust. Promoting collaborative research among think tanks and scholars enables both sides to address contentious issues more constructively, identify feasible policy recommendations and rebuild confidence. Such exchanges could further help revitalise past cooperative efforts, such as the 2015 six-point cybersecurity consensus, and align bilateral efforts with broader international norms developed by the UN Group of Governmental Experts. ## **Microsoft’s Role in Cyber Crisis Management** Given how deeply Microsoft’s systems are embedded in government and private networks worldwide, its ability to anticipate and respond to large-scale cyber incidents has become a key concern for global security. Microsoft has built a fairly comprehensive system for managing cyber crises. This includes monitoring potential threats, coordinating incident response teams, public disclosure practices, and the regular release of intelligence through reports such as the Annual Digital Defence Report and Cyber Signals. In the aftermath of major incidents such as the Hafnium and Antique Typhoon attacks, Microsoft demonstrated a structured, transparent approach to crisis management. The company’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Security Unit (DSU) usually take the lead, identifying attackers, issuing emergency patches, and working closely with cybersecurity bodies such as the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Microsoft also engages in attribution-based reporting. The company often names the threat actors involved (in cases such as Hafnium or Storm-0558) and explains the tactics and tools they used. This kind of transparency has two significant benefits: it improves global understanding of emerging threats and deters repeated attacks by exposing the methods behind them. However, not everyone views this positively. Governments such as China’s have criticised Microsoft’s attributions, calling them politically biased or insufficiently backed by evidence. Central to Microsoft’s broader preparedness strategy is its Annual Digital Defense Reports (DDRs). These reports compile insights from an enormous amount of data: over 65 trillion security signals processed daily across Microsoft’s cloud network. While they offer a look back at global cyber trends, they also serve as forward-looking tools to help governments and organisations evaluate their resilience against new forms of attack. The 2023 report, for example, highlighted the increasing sophistication of state-sponsored hackers, particularly those from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. [\\[20\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn20) It showed how these actors are shifting towards more covert tactics, such as credential theft and supply chain infiltration. Microsoft’s quarterly _Cyber Signals_ reports build on this work, offering more targeted insights by region and sector, effectively bridging technical threat analysis and high-level policy guidance. Despite its active role in crisis management, Microsoft continues to face criticism over its complex position in the cyber landscape. [\\[21\\]](https://www.idsa.in/www.idsa.in#_edn21) It often finds itself both as a primary target of attacks and as a major player in defending against them. This dual role raises a bigger issue: the world’s growing dependence on a single company’s digital infrastructure. When Microsoft is breached, the impact spreads far beyond its own systems. The ongoing US–China cyber rivalry has repeatedly exposed this vulnerability. While Microsoft’s rapid crisis response and transparency help strengthen global resilience, they also reveal how much modern cybersecurity—and, by extension, national security—depends on a single corporate actor. In that sense, Microsoft’s threat assessments and crisis responses have evolved into more than just technical exercises—they now play a part in shaping the global balance of power in cyberspace. ## **Conclusion** The evolution of China’s cyber operations against the United States highlights how cyberspace has become an increasingly contested frontier in great-power rivalry. From Titan Rain and Operation Aurora to Hafnium and Antique Typhoon, the pattern reveals a steady progression from rudimentary data theft to highly sophisticated campaigns that exploit global digital interdependence. Microsoft’s platforms, which anchor both US government and private infrastructure, have emerged as critical battlegrounds in this struggle, reflecting not only their technological ubiquity but also their geopolitical importance. While the US continues to accuse China of state-sponsored cyber espionage and intellectual property theft, China maintains that it too is a victim of cyberattacks, deflecting blame and challenging the credibility of US narratives. This dynamic has created a persistent cycle of accusation and denial, deepening mistrust between the two powers. The cyber contest between the US and China ultimately reflects the broader struggle for influence in the 21st century global order. The Microsoft incidents serve as a reminder that technological dependence can become both a strength and a vulnerability. Unless both sides commit to developing trust-based frameworks and credible deterrence mechanisms, the current trajectory of cyber confrontation could continue to erode international stability and the very foundations of digital cooperation that underpin modern global life.

India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community.

Sagar](https://www.indiatoday.in/author/pradip-r-sagar) UPDATED: Nov 20, 2025 17:32 IST Edited By: [Ashish Mukherjee](https://www.indiatoday.in/author/ashish-mukherjee) China’s weaponisation of artificial intelligence (AI) reached a disturbing level in September when Anthropic, a leading US AI company, revealed the first-ever large-scale cyberattack executed almost entirely by an autonomous AI system. According to Anthropic, Chinese state-linked hackers had used the company’s Claude AI to automate a sophisticated global espionage campaign that targeted nearly 30 top-tier organisations, ranging from technology giants and financial institutions to chemical manufacturers and government agencies. advertisement The attack marked an alarming moment in cybersecurity as the perpetrators had moved beyond using AI solely as an assistant, enabling Claude’s agentic capabilities to operate independently through clever manipulation of its safety protocols. Experts in New Delhi believe that this raises serious national security concerns for India, as critical infrastructure, such as power grids, financial networks, defence installations and government databases, could be targeted in ways that conventional cybersecurity measures may struggle to detect. The experts pointed out that the strategic and defence implications were equally significant. “State-backed AI-driven operations could enable adversaries to gather intelligence on Indian military technology, missile programmes or strategic initiatives, undermining India’s technological advantage and increasing the risk of information warfare,” cautioned a China watcher, adding that the economic and industrial sectors, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, advanced manufacturing and AI research, were particularly vulnerable since autonomous AI can rapidly exfiltrate research and intellectual property, threatening competitiveness and forcing companies to invest heavily in internal cybersecurity measures. By disguising offensive operations as defensive cybersecurity tests, the hackers successfully broke down complex attack sequences into harmless-appearing prompts, which Claude executed at superhuman speed. The AI autonomously mapped networks, identified critical databases, wrote tailored exploits, harvested credentials and organised stolen data, completing up to 90 per cent of tactical actions with minimal human oversight. Human involvement was reduced to authorising escalation and directing transfers of sensitive information while the majority of hands-on infiltration, data mining and documentation were managed by the AI itself. This approach enabled the Chinese operators to achieve a level of efficiency and stealth impossible for manual attackers, marking the entry into a new era of cyberattack modus operandi. According to reports released by Anthropic in November, the Chinese state group GTG-1002 exploited Claude Code to automate every operational step in a campaign aimed at 30 global targets, including critical infrastructure. By using AI to evade safety checks and break attacks into innocuous tasks, the group triggered thousands of operations per second, prompting urgent calls within the cyber-defence community to reassess the threat landscape. advertisement Although Claude’s autonomous capabilities enabled remarkable scalability, the AI’s fabricated results required intermittent human validation—a gap Anthropic addressed by strengthening detection systems and sharing intelligence with authorities. The company’s swift response, which included banning abusive actors and publicising the attack’s details, underscored the growing risk posed by autonomous AI in lowering the barriers for large-scale cyber aggression. China has formally denied allegations of state involvement, dismissing the findings as unsubstantiated and reasserting its longstanding policy against cyberattacks. Nonetheless, experts from Anthropic and independent cyber intelligence continue to attribute the campaign to a state-backed effort, given its sophistication, resource depth and tactical complexity. Similar AI-driven operations by Chinese groups have previously targeted major infrastructure, from Vietnamese telecommunications to several government domains, and global AI providers like OpenAI and Google now report increasingly frequent state-linked misuse of their platforms. Indian cyber authorities responded to the September attack by underlining the nation’s resilience against AI-powered threats and redoubling efforts to safeguard digital sovereignty. A key Indian cybersecurity expert said that India has invested in developing indigenous AI cyber-security tools, prioritising rapid threat detection, real-time response and autonomous network defence. These efforts are bolstered by the ongoing expansion of national security frameworks and a robust, skilled cyber workforce dedicated to countering adversarial AI warfare. advertisement The incident serves as a stark warning to democracies worldwide. With Chinese state-linked hackers now being accused of weaponising AI for scalable, minimally supervised cyberattacks, unified global defences and increased oversight have become critical imperatives. At the global level, autonomous cyberattacks underscore the geopolitical dimension of AI. India’s response—investing in homegrown technology, building resilient networks and enhancing multilateral cooperation—demonstrates that proactive measures can mitigate AI-driven threats. Ankush Tiwari, CEO of pi-labs.ai, an AI technology company, said that large language models will increasingly be used to launch new kinds of cyberattacks, and the recent Claude incident is a clear reminder that these threats will be more sophisticated and easier to execute than anything seen before. “As a nation, we must shift from a reactive mindset to a proactive one, especially when it comes to securing our critical infrastructure. India needs a dedicated national taskforce focused specifically on both AI-enabled threats and threats targeting AI systems and other vital digital assets. For too long, cybersecurity has been treated as an afterthought in our digital ecosystem. That approach must change urgently and decisively,” Tiwari said. The September attack serves as a wake-up call, emphasising that AI-powered espionage is no longer theoretical, and nations must combine technological readiness, strategic foresight and robust governance to protect security, economic competitiveness and democratic stability. advertisement **[**Subscribe to India Today Magazine**](https://subscriptions.intoday.in/indiatoday?utm_source=Insights)** \\- Ends Published By: Shyam Balasubramanian Published On: Nov 20, 2025 [Watch Live TV](https://www.indiatoday.in/livetv?utm_source=articlePage&utm_medium=articlePageLiveTV&utm_campaign=LIVETVarticlePage)",

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead) WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department's 2023 [religious freedom report on India, opens new tab](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-report-on-international-religious-freedom/india/) noted violent attacks on minority groups, especially Muslims and Christians, including killings, assaults and vandalism of houses of worship. The report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that in 2023, senior U.S. officials continued to \"raise concerns about religious freedom issues\" with their Indian counterparts. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/us-religious-freedom-report-notes-violence-against-indian-minorities-2024-06-26/undefined?location=article-paragraph) Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \"In India, we see a concerning increase in anti-conversion laws, hate speech, demolitions of homes and places of worship for members of minority faith communities,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken [said, opens new tab](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-2023-international-religious-freedom-report-rollout/) when the report was released, in a rare direct rebuke of India. Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington [to counter China](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-wishes-india-luck-with-structural-issues-strained-china-ties-2024-06-12/), political analysts say. The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper. The report cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading. The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. The Indian government denies [discriminating](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-will-talk-human-rights-rule-law-with-modi-2023-06-22/) against minorities, and says its welfare policies - like food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - [aim to benefit all Indians](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-denies-stoking-divisions-win-election-files-nomination-2024-05-14/).

The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups. Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced. Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population. Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.

The confirmation follows reports of technical anomalies, including the spoofing of navigational systems, at several big airports nationwide. According to a report from Matrubhumi, Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu informed the Parliament that flights approaching these airports reported GPS spoofing while using GPS-based landing procedures at Runway 10 of the IGI Airport in Delhi. The government acknowledged that the airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru were among those affected by the cybersecurity incidents. ## GPS spoofing reported, says government The primary mode of the[cyber attack](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry/indian-ceos-double-down-on-ai-but-fear-identity-theft-kpmg-2025-report-flags-cybersecurity-and-data-risk-gaps/4012946/)involved the reported spoofing of[Global Positioning System (GPS)](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/airlines-aviation-delhi-airport-chaos-explained-gps-spoofing-suspected-behind-over-400-flight-delays-4036216/)signals, particularly affecting flights approaching the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi. GPS spoofing occurs when false GPS signals are broadcast to receivers, misleading aircraft navigation systems about their actual position and altitude. Despite the serious nature of the cyber attack, the government emphasised that no flight operations were disrupted or cancelled due to the GPS spoofing. Contingency measures and continued security protocols ensured that air traffic control systems maintained stability, allowing flights to operate without interruption. ALSO READ [Is she real?

However, that incident was later attributed to a technical glitch in the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS). The Ministry of Civil Aviation and related security agencies continue to monitor the situation to ensure the uninterrupted flow of air traffic and to implement enhanced cyber countermeasures. The cyber attack also comes just a couple of days after flight operations were impacted globally due to a software-related fix required for[Airbus](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/airlines-aviation-airbus-full-statement-reveals-potential-cause-of-major-a320-recall-read-here-4059884/)A320 airplanes. The A320 narrowbody jet is usually considered the backbone of the domestic and local-level aviation industry, serving all kinds of airlines from even the most remote airports around the world. The issue had impacted around 388 flights in India alone on Saturday. By Sunday, all Indian airlines had completed the software upgrade, which made the planes fit for resuming commercial operations.

ASIT KUMAR/AFP/Getty Images ## Summary Indian media is touting the arrest of Gudsa Usendi, a spokesman for a regional committee of India's Maoist militant rebels known as Naxalites, as a significant victory for the country's counterterrorism efforts. Usendi, whose real name is Gumudavelli Venkatakrishna Prasad, served as the main media contact for the Dandakaranya Special Zone Committee's regional command structure. However, the surrender of a key figure within the country's Maoist insurgent movement is unlikely to be a blow to the Naxalites. As a regional-level public relations officer for the group, Prasad was probably not involved in operational details. Moreover, it takes more than the loss of one personality — even a major figure — to seriously degrade a militant network for any period of time. Prasad's true value will have to be determined in the weeks and months ahead, as Indian intelligence and security officials attempt to establish how much knowledge of Naxalite members (and operations in other, more critical regions) Prasad possessed. Should the defected media officer's surrender prove as significant a boon for New Delhi as Indian media is currently reporting, 2014 should see increased arrests, defections and raids against the Maoist organization's leadership and key positions, even as counterattacks erupt in much of southern and eastern India. The arrest of a major Naxalite figure will not necessarily undermine the rebel movement.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade. But that may start to change. As China forges deeper ties with India's nuclear archrival, Pakistan, and as each...",

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

USAID @ The Asia Foundation LS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Improving Lives, Expanding Opportunities INDIA-U.S. TRIANGULAR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 01 The Asia Foundation, 2022, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey - Opportunities for Strengthening Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific. The Asia Foundation: New Delhi Disclaimer This report is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the ‘India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) at The Asia Foundation. The opinions expressed here are solely of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government and The Asia Foundation. 02 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey Foreword India and the U.S. share a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. India’s long\u0002standing engagement in the region makes it a strong development partner and leader. The Asia Foundation through its India- U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a program funded by USAID, is working toward realizing this vision and strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s development cooperation footprint in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The program builds on the U.S. government’s commitment to strengthen triangular partnership programs with India in the Indo-Pacific region and is informed by the U.S. government’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and its Pacific Islands Strategy. TriDeP seeks to support the Government of India’s development assistance in the Indo\u0002Pacific region by identifying countries keen to expand their development partnership with India in sectors defined by their country needs, and by supporting programming based on such identification. Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Smart Agriculture and Renewable Energy are sectors where India demonstrates policy leadership and technical skills, and thus can provide sustainable solutions. This report presents a diagnostic study that maps India’s capabilities in disaster management, as well as identifying opportunities for India and the developing countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South Asia to partner for promising solutions. Over the years, India’s disaster management approach has evolved rapidly to respond to the slew of challenges posed by a range of disasters. India’s diverse geo-climatic conditions make it vulnerable to multiple natural and human\u0002caused disasters, thus prompting the country to develop tailored policies and frameworks for coordinated multi-stakeholder disaster-risk reduction efforts. TriDeP seeks to leverage India’s know-how in disaster management, by sharing technical expertise and knowledge and supporting local adaptation, to improve resilience and preparedness against disasters in the Indo\u0002Pacific region. TriDeP aims to do this in close collaboration with a range of stakeholders, including governments, communities, and the private sector, through cost-effective and context-specific solutions. This diagnostic identifies India’s expertise in establishing well-defined institutional systems; legislative, policy and planning frameworks; robust search and rescue capabilities; improved early warning systems; technological advancements for disaster risk management; improved emergency communication; expanded disaster resource and knowledge networks; emergency operations centers; enhanced response capabilities and systems; and post-disaster mental health management. The study also identifies opportunities for India-U.S. triangular cooperation across several countries in the Indo-Pacific region. While the diagnostic study was underway, the Covid-19 virus struck with severity unimagined in a century and has brought to the fore the disastrous dimensions of pandemics, including psychological and physical health challenges that require concerted medical responses to India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 03 address them. Several participants in a virtual meeting of experts from the Indo-Pacific region to discuss the study expressed interest in the knowledge and expertise of India in psychosocial care and telemedicine health services, both important focus areas that help to address pandemic-related health issues. I would like to thank Balaji Singh Chowhan, who is the lead author and researcher for this report and an expert in disaster managenment. I would like to thank Veena Reddy, USAID/ India and Bhutan Mission Director; Karen Klimowski, Deputy Mission Director; John Smith-Sreen, Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; MaryTyler E. Holmes, Deputy Director of the Indo-Pacific Office; Sukanya Banerjee, Development Partnership Adviser and the Activity Manager for TriDeP; and Arun Sahdeo, Project Management Specialist (Disaster Risk Management) for their support to the program and their valuable inputs and suggestions that enhanced the quality of the report. Our thanks to all the technical experts from the disaster management sector in India, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Island countries for their participation in the research, valuable insights, and contributions to the study. At The Asia Foundation, we would like to thank Anthea Mulakala, Senior Director for International Cooperation for her guidance during the study. Atul Kaushik, TriDeP Chief of Party, led the planning and execution of the diagnostic, ably assisted by Malavika Thirukode, Program Officer. Ramesh Navaladi, Deputy Chief of Party and Ajay Singh, Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning and Adaptation Specialist, each made valuable contributions to the report’s approach and content. Aparna Achuthan, Program Officer, made valuable contributions to finalizing the report, and Suzan Nolan from BlueSky International contributed to the editing of the report. I hope the findings from this report will pave the way for strengthening India’s and the U.S.’s approach to triangular partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region.

Sen Pilgrims being rescued from Badrinath after the 2021 Uttarakhand flood. 10 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey I ndia, due to its unique geo-climatic conditions, is vulnerable to multiple natural and human-caused disasters, such as droughts, floods, earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, hailstorms, cold waves, heat waves, glacier lake outburst floods, wildfires, oil spills, and other major pollution events. The country’s journey toward holistic and modern disaster risk reduction (DRR) practices began more than 20 years ago, when several natural disasters resulted in thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses. These disasters spurred India toward a more comprehensive DRR approach, eventually leading the country to tremendous disaster management progress: Subsequent disasters have resulted in minimized deaths and losses because of India’s effective DRR efforts. Over the course of the past two decades, India’s disaster management approach evolved from a reactive, search-and-rescue, and relief-centered approach primarily centered on flood and drought to a proactive, holistic approach that includes prevention, mitigation, preparedness, capacity building, risk reduction, technological investment and advancements, community involvement, and risk resilience for a far wider range of hazards. Holistic disaster management requires mainstreaming DRR into policies, institutions, infrastructure, and logistics in order to develop tools for effective and efficient action. India developed DRR policies for multiple stakeholders by integrating inputs from domain experts and all levels of governments and communities; it also increased response effectiveness through international coalitions, and coordinated risk reduction capabilities at the national and local levels. India’s holistic DRR efforts involve robust legal frameworks; effective policy design and development; domestic policy and institutional coherence; a focus on capacity building, expert input, and knowledge sharing; well-oiled administrative mechanisms; an ability to prevent or mitigate disasters before they occur, as well as effective and inclusive rescue and recovery operations. India’s disaster management learning curve owes a great deal to how India adapted crucial disaster management elements from other countries to India’s own context. Now, other countries have the opportunity to emulate India’s DRR journey in order to accelerate their own efforts, thereby saving thousands of lives and millions in economic losses. India has multiple bilateral and multilateral DRR relationships with other countries, such as the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Russia, the European Commission, and United Nations agencies. Given this international cooperation framework already in place and India’s extensive DRR capabilities, it would be hugely beneficial for India to branch out to additional triangular cooperation (TrC) initiatives, especially partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which already has a strong DRR backbone with India. These TrC initiatives would be led by India as the primary source of expertise and technical assistance and could also benefit from the involvement of several United States agencies and private-sector or nongovernmental organizations. India’s South-South development cooperation model would thus be considerably enhanced, with the triangulation of efforts between India and the United States increasing India’s development assistance footprint in the developing countries of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. This report begins with an explanation of India’s 20-year journey from search and rescue\u0002related crisis management to prevention, India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 11 mitigation, and preparedness, setting the groundwork for how India’s experiences can be adapted to other countries’ own disaster management contexts. The second chapter details the interplay between India’s DRR strategy, legislation, policy interventions, disaster management administration and institutions, and its perspectives on gender equity and social inclusion in DRR efforts. Chapter three breaks down how India can share its knowledge and DRR capabilities through the country’s multiple DRR technologies and capacity-building institutions, including centers of excellence for training in general disaster management and early warning systems; specialized institutions for search and rescue and disaster assessment, mitigation, and planning; private- and nongovernmental organization\u0002run training institutes; Incident Command System adaptations; risk communication and language adaptations; and equipment stocks and suppliers. The fourth chapter outlines the DRR status of three Indo-Pacific sub-regions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indo-Pacific Islands, and briefly discusses the potential DRR needs of ideal TrC partners. Chapter five concludes with a discussion about the viability of TrC initiatives, and makes recommendations for suitable TrC activities in 10 Indo-Pacific countries. About the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP) With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) India, The Asia Foundation is implementing the India-U.S. Triangular Development Partnership (TriDeP), a three-year program in support of the United States’ and India’s mutual aims in the Indo\u0002Pacific Region. In a ground-breaking initiative to catalyze North-South-South triangular cooperation (TrC) throughout an entire region – the Indo-Pacific – rather than with a single country, the TriDeP program will facilitate partnerships between India, the United States, and several South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Indo-Pacific Island countries.1 The TriDeP program has identified three priority areas where India can share its proven expertise: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate-smart agriculture, and renewable energy. The TriDeP program team selected DRR for its inaugural research initiative to explore how and where India’s demonstrated DRR policy leadership, practical experience, and sustainable results can be shared with countries in the region. After assessing India’s DRR capacities and capabilities and matching them to the needs and capabilities of potential Indo-Pacific partner countries, the TriDeP program will develop demand-driven, context-specific TrC projects that combine Indian experience and Photographer: Saikiran Kesari Stranded citizens making their way through the flooded streets of Mumbai, India during the 2020 Mumbai floods. 12 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey expertise with Indian and American technical assistance, drawing on India’s centers of excellence, training institutions, relevant private sector entities, and nongovernmental and civil society organizations. Research Objectives The TriDeP program team undertook action research on India’s DRR institutions and capabilities in order to understand the Indian\u0002Indo-Pacific DRR landscape, identify DRR needs in potential beneficiary countries, highlight areas of India’s DRR expertise that could be shared, suggest priority partners and projects for initial TrC implementations, and determine suitable activities to support project design and implementation. Research Methodology The action research for this report took place from January through June 2021. The research process began with a thorough review of the literature followed by nine telephone and seven in-person interviews with 16 Indian government representatives, technical specialists, and practitioners experienced in DRR and disaster management in order to gain a preliminary overview of India’s current capabilities – what we will call the “supply-side” of DRR (see Annexure 1 for participant list). The study also involved extensive desk research to gather background information about India’s supply-side capabilities. The supply-side research also involved convening a group of 17 experts from India, including independent DRR experts, leaders of DRR civil society organizations (CSOs) working in India, and current and retired government functionaries who lead or have led India’s disaster responses. These experts were joined by six supporting Photographer: Dr. Ashok K A Doppler Radar meteorological geodesic dome atop a hillock at Vishakhapatnam, India. India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 13 staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 2 for participant list). The supply-side research was complemented by what we will call “demand-side” desk research about Indo-Pacific countries’ geographies and their disaster exposures, histories, institutional and technical capabilities, current disaster\u0002aid partnerships, and relevant socioeconomic profiles. The desk research was enhanced through discussions with a group of 39 experts in the fields of DRR and climate change impacts; these experts represented countries, states, or organizations from Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Germany, India, Nepal, United Kingdom, United Nations, United States, and international nongovernmental and civil society organizations. These experts were joined by seven supporting staff members from The Asia Foundation and USAID (see Annexure 3 for participant list). The demand-side experts discussed DRR needs as perceived by countries in the region, identified geopolitical interests or sensitivities, and postulated supply-demand matches. Since Covid-19 pandemic restrictions prevented in-person meetings, both supply- and demand-side convenings took place online and lasted about two hours each. During the demand-side convening, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted requests from some Indo-Pacific countries for assistance with health- and psychosocial-care needs to combat and counter the effects of the pandemic. Although the TriDeP team did not focus on pandemic disasters in the initial research phases, this report describes some of India’s supply-side telemedicine and psychosocial-care capabilities that could match demand-side requests for pandemic- and other health-related cooperation projects. Drawing on the desk research, interviews, and discussions with the TriDeP program team, and his own extensive experience in the field and personal familiarity with the actors, the author identifies 10 countries as potential TrC candidates and indicates their potential needs for equipment, services, and technical assistance that would increase the effectiveness of disaster risk management and response. In his selection of potential match countries, the author also considered complementary and competing DRR programs and activities already in progress with other providers. The author cautions, of course, that all DRR assistance proposals should align with host government priorities and that all recommended disaster management solutions must be fine-tuned and based on further contextual analyses. Pertinent facts about the 10 potential match countries and possible TrC initiatives are detailed in Annexure 4, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Maldives, the Philippines, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. In addition, the author presents disaster risk profiles for 16 other Indo-Pacific Region countries that may become candidates for TrC in the future: Brunei, Cook Islands, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Vanuatu (Annexure 5). The author’s TrC recommendations are consistent with the Intermediate Result (IR) 3.1 of the USAID India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS).2 The Asia Foundation is a non-profit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, its work across the region addresses five overarching goals – strengthen governance, empower women, expand economic opportunity, increase environmental resilience, and promote international cooperation. The TriDeP creates an opportunity for The Asia Foundation to examine emerging cross-cutting critical issues, such as disaster risk reduction, that warrant deeper investigation to inform its program strategies to ensure the Foundation remains at the leading edge of changing dynamics in the regional context – geopolitical, environmental, and legal/regulatory – and well-positioned to tackle the most critical issues facing Asia.

To be effective, all these elements must come together as a seamless whole. The policies, institutions, and logistics of disaster management are as important as the actual equipment used to rescue people – absolutely vital in handling disasters, in reaching to the last mile, and in determining the tools for effective and efficient action. Equally important is the involvement of disaster management practitioners in policy design and development – the domain and subject matter experts who understand the complexity and who know how to make disaster management policies, institutions, and logistics work together most effectively. Effective disaster management usually requires a long phase of development; time is the main challenge in setting up vital elements. Experts see India’s present disaster management approach as a journey that lasted just over two decades. It began at the time of super Cyclone Photographer: Fernando Quevedo de Oliveira Forest fires above Thak village in Uttarakhand, India in May, 2016. 16 India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey ‘The Government of India and other stakeholders implemented recommenda- tions from a High Powered Committee (HPC). ‘The HPC’s report guided India’s disaster managernent approach from a relief-centric approach to one that embrac- es prevention, mitigation, and preparedness. fo strengthen India’s approach, the HPC. also made other recommendations: linking development efforts to disaster reduction; estab- lishing a disaster knowledge network, promoting interna- tional cooperation; applying a national disaster mitigation strat adopting a commu- nity-based approach; and fostering a culture of preven- tive thinking, The enactment of the National Disast ment Act and the de lop- ment of a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and state- and district-level disaster n ‘ nt authorities (SDMAs and DDMAs) set the stage for India’s National Institute m of Disaster Management (NIDM) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). India’s Disaster Risk Reduction Journey 17 The National Policy on Disaster Management (2009) motivated community-based disaster management, last-mile integration of policy and plans, executional capacity development, consolidation of past initia- tives, deployment of best prs agencies at national and tices, cooperation with international levels, and multi-sectoral synergies. First announced in Novem- ber 2016 during the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Prime Minister's Ten Point Agenda restated DRR priorities, such as bolstering local capacities, enhancing, knowledge networks, and supporting international coalitions. The 2016 National Disaster Management Plan, subse- quently updated in 2019, provided a [ramework for disaster management plans at the ministerial, depart mental, state, and district levels. The Plan set out mechanisms for multiagency coordina- tion: the National Executive Committee (NEC), headed by the Ministry of Home Affairs Secretary at the national level, and the State Executive headed by a Chief Secretary mmiittee, at the state-government level.",

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism.

His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government's announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts.

Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For[India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail?*Frontline*spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale[farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall [autumn]. **Also Read |[Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael KugelmanAuthor and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine[affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece)and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. *Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of*Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) SHARE THIS STORY * Copy link * [Email]() * Facebook * Twitter * Telegram * LinkedIn * WhatsApp * Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

Advertisement According to The Epoch Times, Mike Burgess, Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), disclosed that China's government-linked cyber groups identified as Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon were behind a wave of cyberattacks on Australia's most vital sectors, including telecommunications, energy, water, and transport systems. Advertisement Addressing the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's cybersecurity forum in Melbourne, Burgess said the hackers worked under the command of China's intelligence agencies and military. Advertisement Burgess revealed that Volt Typhoon had already infiltrated US military infrastructure in Guam, gaining the capability to \"turn off telecommunications and other critical infrastructure.\" Similar reconnaissance and penetration attempts have been detected in Australia, he said, as hackers sought long-term, stealthy access to networks that could be activated at any time. \"When they penetrate your systems, they map them aggressively,\" he stated, describing the campaigns as \"highly sophisticated\" operations intended to maintain control for potential sabotage. Advertisement Espionage and foreign interference inflicted an estimated loss of $12.5 billion on Australia's economy in 2023-24. Burgess cited a joint ASIO-Australian Institute of Criminology report that projected cyber-enabled sabotage could cost up to $6 billion for a week-long disruption, figures he called \"extremely conservative.\" He warned that such access could be weaponised to cripple companies, disrupt elections, or paralyse key industries during crises, as highlighted by The Epoch Times. Burgess accused the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of attempting to pressure ASIO into softening its public statements, declaring, \"Complaining about ASIO doing its job will not stop my resolve.\" His remarks follow rising friction between Australia and Canada, including a Chinese jet's hostile action against an Australian aircraft over the South China Sea. Burgess concluded by urging Australian businesses to treat cyber defence as a matter of national security, as reported by The Epoch Times.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

Surrounding the golden fortress city of Jaisalmer in India’s Thar desert, a sea of wind turbines stretches out across the arid landscape as far as the eye can see — visibly marking the world’s third-largest carbon emitter’s green power expansion. Engineers at a 30MW wind farm here operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest clean energy developers, speak with pride about contributing to a national renewable capacity goal of 500GW by 2030. Yet not all of the country’s green power can be dispatched, with the energy grid emerging as a choking constraint. Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew, is confident India will “definitely” achieve its renewable capacity target. “I can see that we’ll get to 500GW, but we won’t be able to exceed it because there’s not enough transmission.” While India boasts one of the world’s largest transmission networks, spanning more than 494,000 circuit kilometres, the grid has not kept pace with the surge in renewable projects. More than 50GW of capacity is stranded, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a US-based think-tank, and JMK Research & Analytics, an Indian cleantech research and consulting firm. © Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images “Transmission has become a critical bottleneck . . . causing rising curtailment and commissioning delays in resource-rich states,” says Jyoti Gulia, founder and chief executive of JMK. Earlier this year, Pralhad Joshi, India’s minister for new and renewable energy, hailed a “Historic Green Leap” after the country reached 50 per cent of its [power capacity from renewables](https://www.ft.com/content/a99a5845-9f50-49a3-8c7c-d704b2cf3b95), now totalling 243GW. Even so, Gulia says, grid expansion delays would “lock in higher coal generation”. Nearly three-quarters of India’s power currently comes from coal, which remains central to meeting its growing electricity demand. This is partly due to fragmented planning between state and central authorities, which largely run India’s grid, as well as mismatched build cycles. Renewable projects can be completed in 12 to 18 months, while transmission lines typically take three to five years. Clean power is also predominantly produced in three states: Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while high demand regions such as Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have little capacity, making cross state delivery critical. “To perfect the timing is impossible,” Ashish Khanna, chief executive of Adani Green Energy — the country’s largest renewable power company — said in September at the Financial Times’ Energy Transition Summit in New Delhi. “You can’t first wait for a grid to come and then build a renewable project.” Those constraints have become the most visible in the northwestern wind and sun-rich state of Rajasthan and development heavy areas there such as Jaisalmer. IEEFA and JMK estimate that 8GW of clean power capacity in the state currently cannot be transmitted. One renewable industry executive in Rajasthan says the “spurt” of green projects, paired with slow grid growth, will probably slow further capacity build out for at least a couple of years. Developers also face obstacles from environmental blockages and grinding [difficulties acquiring contiguous land](https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e) in a country with hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers. In parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat, a years-long legal ban has prevented new overhead transmission lines from being laid across more than 100,000 sq km to protect the Great Indian Bustard, a [highly endangered and poor-sighted bird](https://www.ft.com/content/cec843fe-804a-43a4-b89a-4f7970c3a6a4) known to fly into power cables. In key areas, smaller players have also exploited those time lags, pre-booking chunks of transmission capacity with no intention of building power plants — driving up premiums to secure connectivity, which they then sell to developers. This delays projects and further burdens genuine operators. Gulia says the bureaucratic need for multi-agency clearances and right-of-way permits that are frequently initiated post-award cause “months to years of delay”. Ideally there should be a single-window regulatory clearance system with strict timelines, she says, as well as performance-based incentives and disincentives. Last year India announced a plan to bolster the power grid and deploy the vast amounts of renewable energy coming online. The expansion is expected to cost Rs9.15tr ($104bn) to allow the transmission of 600GW of green power capacity by 2032. However, India’s Central Electricity Authority agency has acknowledged that public funding will not be sufficient to cover the build-out, which means the private sector is likely to have to step in. Private investment from the likes of Adani and Tata Power is already starting to reshape the sector, Khanna at Adani Green says. About 9 per cent of the grid is operated by corporates. “They are going to bring their own efficiencies to the system,” adds Khanna, “so I am hopeful that in times to come we will have less \\[of a\\] gap.” ### Europe’s Climate Leaders _The FT is compiling its sixth annual list of Europe’s climate leaders.

    "full_text": "DBEA55AED16C0C92252A6554BC1553B2DBEA55AED16C0C92252A6554BC1553B2 [Skip to content](https://airinsight.com/airinsight.com#content) Care to share? Hundreds of flights were delayed last week, creating chaos at Delhi Airport, India’s busiest aviation hub, after an unusual air traffic control (ATC) system glitch crippled operations. The disruption has prompted the government to order an urgent upgrade of critical ATC systems across the world’s fastest-growing aviation market. More than 800 flights were delayed from Thursday evening after Delhi’s ATC unit detected a malfunction in the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) — the platform used to process and transmit flight plans. The failure forced controllers to input flight data manually. Every flight plan — detailing routing, fuel requirements, altitude, and weather parameters — had to be generated by hand, a process that takes several minutes per aircraft. With hundreds of departures and arrivals scheduled each hour, the entire operation slowed sharply. “Primarily, it seems to be a software problem,” [said Satyajit Dutta](https://x.com/PTI_News/status/1987206531503489135?s=20), retired General Manager at the Airports Authority of India (AAI). “The AMSS handles the transmission of flight plans from airlines to ATC and other airspaces. The disruption affected only this component — not the entire ATC system — which is why flights were delayed but not stopped.” The sudden crash prompted the Civil Aviation Minister, [Ram Mohan Naidu,](https://x.com/RamMNK/status/1987191631309906005?s=20) [to visit the airport](https://x.com/RamMNK/status/1987191631309906005?s=20) on Friday to review the situation. The timing was particularly sensitive — Delhi Airport manages several VVIP flights daily, and the glitch coincided with key political travel activity as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders campaigned in eastern India. It also occurred during India’s peak travel season, marked by surging vacation demand and a surge in foreign tourist arrivals. The AAI, which operates air navigation systems across India, has now been directed to upgrade all AMSS systems at major airports within three months. According to officials, the affected software — [developed by the Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/civil-aviation-minister-orders-probe-into-delhi-airport-glitch/articleshow/125192019.cms), a government-owned firm — was already being phased out. Naidu has ordered a detailed investigation into the Delhi Airport ATC glitch and called for a “root-cause analysis” to prevent future incidents. He also instructed officials to design redundant and fallback servers to strengthen system resilience. Reports suggest that AAI’s employee union had previously flagged concerns about aging automation systems. In a July communication, the [Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild of India](https://www.news18.com/india/centre-sets-90-day-deadline-for-atc-upgrade-after-delhi-airport-glitch-9694153.html) warned: “Current systems, especially at major airports like Delhi and Mumbai, have experienced performance degradation, directly impacting operational efficiency and safety margins.” Although the AMSS was restored late Friday night and Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) announced on X that “all flight operations are normal,” the episode has raised deeper concerns. Despite AAI’s nearly $900 million in annual profit and significant modernization investments at Delhi Airport, critical software upgrades appear to have been delayed. There are also lingering questions about staffing shortages — even basic amenities [like a coffee vending machine](https://airinsight.com/ATCOs'%20Guild%20of%20India%20warned%20in%20July%20that%20%22current%20systems,%20especially%20at%20major%20airports%20like%20Delhi%20and%20Mumbai,%20have%20experienced%20performance%20degradation...%20directly%20impacting%20operational%20efficiency%20and%20safety%20margins%22.) (which the ministry has now noted) remain lacking, according to staff. To be sure, the Delhi incident is part of a [wider pattern of air traffic control and airport system outages globally in 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2025/05/21/air-traffic-control-outages-dozens-us-airports-since-2022/). Earlier this year, **Newark Airport** in the U.S. suffered two separate failures in its radar and radio communications that disrupted hundreds of flights. At the same time, **London’s Heathrow Airport** was forced to suspend operations for several hours after a power substation fire cut electricity to terminals. The **U.S. Federal Aviation Administration** also faced a wave of flight delays in mid-2025 due to automation issues and controller shortages. These episodes underscore how increasingly complex and interdependent global aviation systems have become—and the urgency of building robust digital and hardware backups. Nevertheless, Indian lawmakers are likely to press the Civil Aviation Ministry in upcoming parliamentary sessions on why backup systems were absent, and whether India’s ATC infrastructure is keeping pace with the demands of a rapidly expanding aviation market. Experts say the incident underscores the urgent need for **AI-driven predictive maintenance, cybersecurity audits, and real-time monitoring** to ensure India’s airspace remains safe and globally competitive.

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

General Assembly in New York City on Sept. 22, 2023. (BING GUAN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) A trilateral partnership between the United States, Japan and the Philippines focusing on cyberdefense, joint maritime patrols and supply chain resilience will likely help improve freedom of navigation and economic security in the South China Sea, but it may also raise the risk of trade disputes and conflict with China. U.S. President Joe Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a state visit on April 10, followed by a trilateral summit on April 11 where Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will also be present. The trilateral summit between the United States, the Philippines and Japan will be the first of its kind and will focus on three main areas: national security, economic security and mitigating climate change, with an eye toward institutionalizing cooperation via formal dialogue mechanisms in the medium-to-long term. The summit will likely conclude with the issuance of a joint vision statement laying out each country's... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

    "full_text": "If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up...",

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.
