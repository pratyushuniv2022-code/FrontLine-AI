India is likely to defer much-needed military modernisation and maritime expansion into the Indian Ocean — which would impair its ability to compete strategically with China. - In contrast, China incurred only marginal material costs; it was probably more concerned with the prospect of continued deterioration in its relationship with India. Even that cost was more threatened rather than realised, and largely reduced when the disengagement plan was agreed. ## Executive Summary In May 2020, China launched several near-simultaneous incursions across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, into territory hitherto controlled by India. Both sides reinforced their positions with tens of thousands of troops, engaged in a deadly skirmish, and reportedly came close to war. An agreement to disengage troops was announced in February 2021, but implementation has been halting. Regardless of how disengagement progresses, the crisis poses significant challenges for India’s long-term strategic competition with China. As a result of the Ladakh crisis, India faces a new strategic reality in which China is a clear and abiding adversary. For India, the political relationship is now defined by hostility and distrust, and the LAC will remain more heavily militarised and violence-prone. Given this new reality, India is likely to further defer military modernisation and maritime expansion into the Indian Ocean. In the face of unremitting Chinese naval expansion, India risks losing significant political and military leverage in the Indian Ocean. At the same time, China appears to have escaped significant harm. Its better-resourced military could better absorb the material costs of the mobilisation. It may have been more concerned by the prospect of an increasingly hostile India, but the disengagement agreement has limited even those modest political costs. The central policy challenge for India is balancing the heightened Chinese military threat on the northern border with the rapidly growing Chinese military presence in the Indian Ocean. It can manage this challenge by focusing on military strategies of denial rather than punishment, focusing on imposing political rather than material costs on China, and accepting more risk at the LAC in exchange for long-term leverage in the Indian Ocean region. How India responds will shape not only its strategic competition with China, but also the interests of likeminded partners including Australia, which depend on an increasingly capable and active India.

[\\[1\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn1) Both sides reinforced their positions with tens of thousands of troops, as well as tanks and aircraft, and built infrastructure to sustain a long-term presence through the coming winter. The LAC had, in effect, been changed by force, with few apparent options for resolution. [\\[2\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn2) The crisis escalated when a skirmish in the Galwan Valley left 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers dead. The two sides have endured several tense standoffs since their border war in 1962, but this was the first loss of life on the LAC since 1975. In late August, Indian forces occupied tactically-valuable peaks on the Kailash Range near Chushul — which, although on Indian-controlled territory, nevertheless gave India significant military leverage in the crisis. [\\[3\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn3) Around Pangong Tso (lake), shots were fired for the first time in nearly half a century, and China launched cyber-attacks against Indian civilian infrastructure.

The commander of the Indian Army’s Northern Command later revealed, “we were absolutely on the brink” of war. [\\[5\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn5) ![](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/Map-Ladakh%20final.png)_A skirmish in the Galwan Valley on 15 June 2020 left 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of_ _Chinese soldiers dead, marking the first loss of life on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since 1975._ For months, China showed no signs of reversing the incursions until the surprise announcement in February 2021 of a phased disengagement plan. [\\[6\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn6) In fact, the two foreign ministers had in September 2020 struck an in-principle agreement to disengage, which appeared to go nowhere until the details of the first phase of disengagement were secretly agreed at a Corps Commanders’ meeting in late January. [\\[7\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn7) The crisis’ future trajectory remains unclear. Disengagement may proceed as intended, leading to new dispositions and procedures for managing the border. Or, if disengagement goes awry, the two sides may yet engage in open warfare. Or the crisis may never get its photo-opportunity handshake or climactic battle — keeping India and China perpetually close to conflict and becoming the central defining feature of an unstable relationship. > Whatever its denouement — whether war or peace or something in between — the crisis will further complicate India’s efforts to compete strategically with China. Whatever its denouement — whether war or peace or something in between — the crisis will further complicate India’s efforts to compete strategically with China. The crisis has ushered in a new strategic reality, which includes deeper political antagonism between the countries, and a more militarised and violence-prone LAC, which will endure even if — a big if — disengagement continues as planned. This new strategic reality will pose yet another politically salient obstacle to the Indian military’s long-frustrated attempts to build power projection capabilities into the Indian Ocean region. Every quantum of scarce military resources that India invests in the land frontier — relatively unthreatening to China’s global ambitions — is a quantum that it will not invest to counterbalance China’s more consequential military expansion into the Indian Ocean. A relatively peripheral border crisis in Ladakh thereby risks generating a far more significant crisis in India’s strategic competition with China — the crisis after the crisis. This paper is divided into three parts. First, I set a baseline understanding of the new political and military reality on the India–China border, emerging as a result of the Ladakh crisis. Second, I argue that this new reality will complicate India’s efforts to compete with China because it further defers India’s military modernisation and maritime expansion in the Indian Ocean and imposes only marginal costs on China. Third, I offer some recommendations for how India can use lessons from the Ladakh crisis to compete more effectively in the future. ## The New Strategic Reality To the extent that the February disengagement plan entails at least a partial PLA withdrawal, it is an evolution in the crisis. But it does not in itself meet New Delhi’s declared goal of a return to the status quo ante. [\\[8\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn8) And, unless disengagement is completed equally on both sides, and accompanied by the withdrawal of forces from theatre — which is unlikely — it risks codifying China’s military revision of the territorial status quo. Beyond the status of specific parcels of land, the central effect of the Ladakh border crisis on Indian security policy is a new and more hostile approach to China, manifested at both the political and operational levels. For Indian defence policy, this translates into a more heavily militarised and violence-prone LAC, and a national defence priority that will require rebalancing resources away from other imperatives. ## Political hostility and distrust At the political level, New Delhi sees the PLA’s Ladakh incursions as an abrogation of decades of painstaking political compromises and confidence-building. After the bruising 1962 border war, decades passed before the countries normalised relations again, and decades again before they concluded three diplomatic agreements on managing the unresolved border. These agreements — signed between 1993 and 2013 [\\[9\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn9) — were operationally useful because they provided guidelines for maintaining “peace and tranquility” on the frontier. But politically they were invaluable because they allowed the two rising powers to table their territorial dispute and proceed with building a wider economic and political relationship. [\\[10\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn10) From New Delhi’s perspective, China’s transgressions in 2020 — its unprecedented troop presence across and near the LAC, as well as the fatal skirmish in the Galwan Valley on 15 June — have obliterated the diplomatic architecture upon which border management and the bilateral relationship were built. Little wonder, then, that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar decried the Ladakh crisis as having “profoundly disturbed the relationship”, and placed it under “exceptional stress”. [\\[11\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn11) In the words of former Indian Ambassador to China and National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon, “political relations will now be more adversarial, antagonistic, and contentious… there is no grand bargain, no modus vivendi, no accepted rules of the road to be had”. [\\[12\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn12) For India, this is not a matter of local military procedures, but a rupture in the entire bilateral relationship. ![](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/Galway%20Valley%20clash%20Getty.jpg)_Video frame grab taken from footage recorded in mid-June 2020, showing Chinese (foreground) and Indian_ _soldiers (R, background) during an altercation in the Galwan Valley. Image: AFP/China Central Television (CCTV) via Getty Images._ Such a rupture is unlikely to be repaired, despite the progress made by agreeing to disengagement. Reversing the previous policy, New Delhi has now made the wider bilateral relationship conditional on border stability. Speaking publicly, weeks after disengagement, External Affairs Minister Jaishankar made this clear: The future of our relationship…if you want to see progress, I need peace and tranquility on the border. I can’t have tension on the border. I can’t have the kind of issues I had in Galwan, and then say, well, you know, let’s carry on with business in the rest of our relationship. That’s unreal. [\\[13\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn13) This new political framing has doubtless cratered India’s trust in China as a diplomatic partner. Any future diplomatic arrangements will probably be harder to reach, and even if the two sides find enough common ground to strike an agreement, Indian leaders will probably require additional assurances that China will honour its commitments. New Delhi is now likely to “distrust until verified”. [\\[14\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn14) Verifying China’s compliance, and hedging against its non-compliance, will require a larger and more watchful military presence on the ground near the LAC. ## Military threat At the operational level, therefore, a long-term increased militarisation of the LAC is all but inescapable. Even if the February 2021 disengagement plan is executed and leads to new confidence-building measures, India’s newfound distrust of China will likely demand a heavier military posture nearby that enables rapid mobilisation to the LAC. Short of that new border-management architecture, India is preparing to maintain its larger military presence on the border virtually indefinitely. Traditionally, the Indian Army had maintained a peacetime strength of about one infantry division in Ladakh. During the crisis, it reinforced them with a further two divisions, plus additional enablers. In total, some 40 000–50 000 Indian soldiers were deployed to eastern Ladakh. [\\[15\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn15) These troops were joined by India’s most advanced main battle tanks, self-propelled howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, and brand-new Rafale multirole fighters. [\\[16\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn16) The Chief of Army Staff, General Naravane, publicly declared that the Army will maintain that additional deployment “for as long as needed”, suggesting there is no operational urgency to return to peacetime positions. [\\[17\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn17) Notwithstanding the beginnings of disengagement, Chinese forces remain in some areas previously controlled by India. The most operationally valuable of these is the Depsang Plain, in northeastern Ladakh, where the PLA impeded Indian patrolling intermittently before the May 2020 incursions. [\\[18\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn18) Even with the disengagement plan’s initial buffer zones in place, such as at Pangong Tso, forces from both sides will remain deployed in theatre through its gradual execution. Privately, Indian officials have suggested that — given the difficulties of diplomatically or militarily returning to the status quo ante — the permanent deployments may be their best option for managing the crisis over the long term. [\\[19\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn19) China’s actions, before and since the crisis began, have offered ample impetus for the Indian deployments. Quite apart from the multiple incursions in May 2020, China has reinforced its troops and developed supporting infrastructure on its side of the LAC. The PLA — mirroring the Indian Army — has constructed winterised housing and logistics to sustain its recently deployed forces for the long term, along with fixed weapons positions, such as airfields and surface-to-air missile systems. [\\[20\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn20) ![](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/Map-Doklam%20final.png)_Troop reinforcement and supporting infrastructure accelerated after the 2017 Doklam standoff, when Indian_ _forces physically impeded the construction of a Chinese road in territory that India maintains is Bhutanese._ Some of this military development predates the crisis and is occurring in all sectors of the LAC.

[\\[22\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn22) Indeed, China has more than doubled the number of airbases, heliports, and air defence sites within operational reach of the LAC since 2017. [\\[23\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn23) This is not a one-sided affair — India has similarly been upgrading its military infrastructure and capabilities near the LAC in recent years, correcting many years of neglect. [\\[24\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn24) Both sides in recent years have significantly bolstered the military forces and infrastructure within striking distance of the LAC, allowing both to quickly adopt an operationally threatening posture in times of crisis. China’s growing presence near the LAC also includes new civilian dual-use (civilian/military) infrastructure. In disputed territory, new buildings and roads are designed to add permanence and credibility to Beijing’s territorial claims — not unlike in the South China Sea, where China has built ‘facts on the ground’ by reclaiming land and constructing infrastructure on it. This practice is not simply a tactic in territorial disputes; it is part of a grander exercise in nation-building that predates the current crisis. Since 2017, China has accelerated a program of improving housing and transport infrastructure, and founding entire new settlements, across Tibet. This civil construction has a strategic purpose. Beijing’s aim is to promote economic development, political allegiance, and border security — and thus to consolidate Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control — in its disputed and restive periphery.

For India, the operational threat on the LAC is compounded by the persistent operational threat on the Line of Control (LoC), which separates Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir. Together, the persistent threats on the LAC and LoC suggest India could quickly descend into a nightmarish two-front contingency. Notwithstanding the February agreement between the Indian and Pakistani armies to renew their defunct ceasefire, the military threat in Jammu and Kashmir remains unchanged.

This has commonly come to be known as the “LoC-isation” of the LAC, in reference to the heavily armed and constantly violent LoC which splits Indian- and Pakistani-controlled portions of Jammu and Kashmir. The analogy, of course, is imperfect. The LoC in Jammu and Kashmir generally runs through less inhospitable terrain and climate, allowing for higher force density. [\\[30\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn30) India-Pakistan relations are more openly hostile, and until the recent ceasefire agreement, the LoC routinely saw high and rising rates of cross-border artillery and small-arms exchanges. Nevertheless, the LAC has already begun to resemble the LoC in some important ways. India is likely to retain a significantly higher number of troops forward deployed on the LAC, even during and after disengagement; and these troops will take position in a larger number of posts to monitor the LAC. [\\[31\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn31) At least one additional infantry division will be permanently relocated to Ladakh, even after the current crisis reinforcements are redeployed.

[\\[33\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn33) Troops require significant time to acclimatise when deploying to the region, and specialised training and equipment to operate effectively as mountain infantry. They also require new logistics arrangements — in particular, remaining in forward positions throughout the harsh winter will require pre-positioning of food and stores, more winterised shelters, and more all-weather equipment. [\\[34\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn34) With a larger number of troops on both sides in relatively much closer contact, the risk of violence will be higher. The disengagement plan establishes some temporary buffer areas where troops are prohibited, but not all planned buffer areas have been implemented, and they will likely only be temporary. [\\[35\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn35) Whereas pre-crisis patrols on both sides had extremely strict rules of engagement and abided by a well-understood choreography to manage encounters with the other side, such procedures have been severely undermined by the events of the Ladakh crisis. In the deadly 15 June skirmish, both Indian and PLA troops used improvised hand-held weapons, and in a subsequent incident near Chushul, troops on both sides discharged their firearms. [\\[36\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn36) Trust in those confidence-building mechanisms has fallen and the Indian Army has accordingly relaxed its rules of engagement on the LAC, to include less restriction on the use of firearms. [\\[37\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn37) ![](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/thumbnail_1.%20Pangong%20Tso%20by%20Jane%20Spicer_0.jpg)_Pangong Tso (lake), which straddles the Line of Actual Control. Image: Jane Spicer._ Even with disengagement, heavier forces are not far behind the LAC. Commercial satellite imagery reveals that the Chinese armour which disengaged from Pangong Tso has relocated to a staging area near Rutog, and is supported by new shelters there, suggesting an intent to garrison there long term. [\\[38\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn38) With a larger number of troops, backed by more heavy weapons such as artillery and armour in close proximity, and with looser rules of engagement, local commanders facing adversary troops may feel compelled to use escalating force to hold their position or thwart enemy action. Even without inadvertent escalation, either side may seek to use its accumulated military power on the LAC to improve its defensive position or gain coercive leverage. India did precisely this when its troops took up new positions on the heights of the Kailash Range in late August. Even though India was deploying military force in territory it already controlled, the episode occurred in the midst of a heavily militarised crisis and raised the risk of unintended escalation. Thus, with increased militarisation, encounters with the opposing side have become more unpredictable and more prone to escalation. ## Rebalancing the Indian Army India’s new strategic reality is not limited to Ladakh — India faces increased threats and uncertainty all along the LAC. At Naku La, at the international border in northern Sikkim, Indian and Chinese troops in close proximity have clashed twice, in May 2020 and January 2021. [\\[39\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn39) Commercial satellite imagery reveals that China built new roads and fortifications near Naku La in the second half of 2020. [\\[40\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn40) In the eastern sector of the LAC, facing the Indian state of Aruncahal Pradesh, China has not only continued its military and civil infrastructure construction, but has also threatened to build a new dam on what India calls the Brahmaputra River — a move which would give China control of a crucial water source for northeastern India. [\\[41\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn41) Thus, India has no assurances that the May 2020 Ladakh incursions were the only or the final threat to the territorial status quo — other acts of aggression or coercion may yet occur. Recognising this more general threat, the Indian Army has begun to rebalance its forces. The most significant expression of this rebalancing to date was the reorientation of a combined-arms strike corps to focus on China. In December 2020, the Indian Army ordered one of those formations, I Corps — one of three such strike corps tasked with penetrating deep into Pakistani territory in wartime — to prepare for a new operational role: launching offensive strikes across the LAC in Ladakh. [\\[42\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn42) This rebalancing is a major commitment — a costly signal of the Indian Army’s intent to devote greater resources to the LAC. Re-tasking a strike corps is not simply a matter of pointing the forces in a different direction — the conversion into mountain infantry will require re-training and re-equipping that will likely take years to complete, and which will be extremely difficult and costly to reverse. [\\[43\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn43) Therefore, this is not a temporary surge to manage the Ladakh crisis, but a permanent reassignment of forces. > India’s new strategic reality is not limited to Ladakh — India faces increased threats and uncertainty all along the LAC. The conversion will also rob the Army of one of its three strike corps dedicated to Pakistan — a very significant erosion in India’s already-slim local quantitative advantage over Pakistan. Indian military strategy relies centrally on the threat of a punishing offensive against Pakistan. So, the elimination of a large portion of those strike forces may portend a long-overdue rethinking of Indian strategy towards Pakistan — a tacit recognition by the Army that its conventional deterrent against Pakistan was either not necessary or not effective. Nor does the February 2021 LoC ceasefire renewal ameliorate the military threat from Pakistan. Such ceasefires have been routinely struck and routinely obliterated in the past. The Pakistan Army has agreed to reduce violence on the LoC, but it has not relinquished its revisionist claims on Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir or altered its India-centric force posture. Alongside the re-tasking of I Corps, the Indian Army’s rebalance will concentrate more force elsewhere on the LAC. The existing Mountain Strike Corps, XVII Corps, which had previously been split to cover both western and eastern sectors of the LAC, will now be concentrated in the eastern sector, expanding the amount of offensive combat power available there. [\\[44\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn44) Several other formations are also slated to focus on the LAC, including an infantry division repurposed to operate as mountain infantry based in Uttarakhand, [\\[45\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn45) a new armoured brigade to be raised and deployed to Sikkim, and some 20 battalions of Assam Rifles troops, previously tasked with counterinsurgency.

[\\[47\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn47) This rebalancing, moreover, must occur without any significant additional resources. The government’s budget for 2021–22, handed down in February 2021, revealed virtually no growth on the previous year’s allocations. The military services did make emergency procurements, over and above their initial allocations, in 2020. [\\[48\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn48) Most of the Army’s unplanned spending went towards construction works — presumably to sustain the massive reinforcements in Ladakh. Compared to those revised estimates, the military’s 2021–22 capital expenditure budget — money spent on equipment and infrastructure — is virtually flat. [\\[49\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn49) In recent years, the Indian economy has shown no plausible prospect of increased defence spending. [\\[50\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn50) And with the added economic burden of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced contraction, the military has even less chance of gaining any more national resources. Responding to China may be a strategic priority, but it will attract no new resources. ## Unequal Strategic Costs ![](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/Quad%20Summit.png)_The virtual Quad summit, held between the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, on 12 March 2021._ _Image: Adam Schultz/Official White House Photo/Flickr._ Some analysts suggest that the post-crisis strategic reality — India’s increased militarisation of the LAC and an inter-theatre rebalancing of forces — should be welcomed as a rational response to its threat environment. Indeed, a tangible response to the rapidly growing China threat is overdue — planning against Pakistan still attracts a disproportionate share of Indian military resources. Even with the Army’s rebalance, 22 divisions still face Pakistan, while only 14 face China (and 2 are held in a national reserve). [\\[51\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn51) In recent decades, the military’s mid- and senior-grade officers grew to recognise China as India’s most capable rival, but nevertheless harboured much greater emotive enmity towards Pakistan as India’s primary threat. [\\[52\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn52) In that context, the Ladakh crisis is a necessary catalyst to promote strategic adaptation, to focus more on the China threat. But the manner of that adaptation risks leaving India in a worse position in its long-term strategic competition with China. Most significantly, it will probably defer much-needed military expansion in the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, the increased militarisation of the LAC will not impose any significant material or political cost on China. This unequal distribution of costs is already generating a deeper crisis in Indian defence policy that will fester long after the current crisis in Ladakh. ## India will defer overdue modernisation and maritime expansion The central risk of India’s new strategic reality is that it will reinforce India’s traditional emphasis on its continental threats at the expense of addressing increasingly acute modernisation needs and maritime risks. India’s military threat perceptions have always been dominated by the prospect of invasion or infiltration from Pakistan and China. This preoccupation with India’s land borders accounts for the Army’s domination of Indian defence budget allocations and its relatively slow expansion of maritime power in the Indian Ocean region. [\\[53\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn53) In recent years, India has taken tentative steps in modernising its military and expanding its maritime power in the Indian Ocean region. The Navy began to operate round-the-clock “mission-based deployments” at the ocean’s key chokepoints, to monitor threats and respond quickly when needed. [\\[54\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn54) It undertook a flurry of exercises with partners and, more importantly, operational activity, especially in providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, to expand its visibility and influence in the region. [\\[55\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn55) And it started to acquire a slew of state-of-the-art platforms, including P-8I anti-submarine warfare and maritime patrol aircraft, MH-60R maritime multi-mission helicopters, and Sea Guardian drones — all of which would vastly improve its ability to operate in the ocean and cooperate with partner countries such as the United States and Australia.

[\\[58\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn58) The LAC commands far greater political attention than distant corners of the Indian Ocean, even though the strategic challenge is more acute in the Indian Ocean. The China border is now the site not only of a menacing foreign army, but also foreign encampment on previously Indian-controlled territory, and the site of clashes that spilled Indian blood. The Indian Ocean, meanwhile, is a large and amorphous region of hypothetical future threats — certainly not the stuff that stokes politically-useful nationalist fervour. But it presents serious challenges to Indian policy. Given budgetary constraints, the resources to manage the new LAC threat must be found from somewhere within the military’s current allocation. The risk is not that already-allocated resources will be diverted from the Navy to the Army — India cannot, for instance, re-task a guided-missile destroyer to the Himalayas. Rather, the risk is that future resource allocations will continue to favour the ground and supporting air forces slated for the military’s highest-priority continental contingencies, at the expense of naval and supporting air forces that are already in desperate need of recapitalisation and modernisation. Across the military, the urgent emphasis on operations and readiness will starve the military of resources for modernisation. In recent years, the share of the defence budget spent on capital outlays has shrunk, while the share spent on pensions has grown. [\\[59\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn59) These capital outlays are typically insufficient even to pay for committed liabilities — previously-signed contracts — risking default on existing contracts and further reducing the funds available for new acquisitions. [\\[60\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn60) Each of the three services is allocated less money than it requests from the government, but the Navy has been particularly hard hit, receiving only 60 per cent of the funds it requests for modernisation. [\\[61\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn61) > Across the military, the urgent emphasis on operations and readiness will starve the military of resources for modernisation. Similarly, for the Army itself, the risk is that a renewed focus on operations on a ‘hot’ border will prevent its long-planned modernisation and downsizing. The current Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, while in his previous position as Chief of Army Staff, had sketched a plan to cut 100 000 personnel from the Army to ease the budgetary pressure of personnel and pension costs and to facilitate the Army’s transition to a more technology-centred force.

Debates on the Indian Navy’s force structure are often reduced to the question of whether it should acquire a third aircraft carrier, as an oversimplified proxy for debates over Indian naval strategy. In fact, the under-resourced Navy is struggling to even maintain its current modest force levels — its submarine fleet, for example, is shrinking because it cannot replace its ageing boats before they retire. [\\[68\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn68) With declining budgets and dysfunctional procurement processes, its ships lack critical capabilities — its dedicated anti-submarine warfare corvettes, for example, lack advanced sonars and torpedoes.

If India’s maritime expansion continues to be deferred, the Navy will quickly lose the capability to deter or defeat Chinese coercion in the Indian Ocean region. The PLA Navy is rapidly expanding — from 2014 to 2018 it launched new shipping with more tonnage than the entire Indian Navy. [\\[71\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn71) Since 2008, it has maintained a naval task group in the Gulf of Aden, and a constant presence of at least seven ships in the Indian Ocean.

Its security practices and doctrinal publications have in recent decades consistently displayed an ever-increasing ambition to execute military operations in the “far seas”, to include the Indian Ocean. [\\[75\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn75) This matters for the future of Indian military in the region. If India fails to invest quickly and generously enough in its own naval capabilities, at a time when China is rapidly expanding its own military presence, it will find it more challenging to assert even temporary and local sea control to sustain naval operations, or the ability to project force across the ocean. > The sheer size and complexity of the Indian Ocean region offers China a wide menu of new options to degrade India’s influence, threaten its interests, and pressure it militarily. India may yet accelerate or at least continue its modernisation in the Indian Ocean. It has, for example, mooted a greater fortification of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. [\\[76\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn76) But so far, such maritime expansion has not materialised. Unlike the rebalancing of the Army’s strike corps, the military has not made any costly signals of a post-Ladakh expansion in the Indian Ocean. Deferring military investments in the Indian Ocean region will set back India’s ability to compete with China. Compared to the land border, swings in the balance of military power and political influence in the Indian Ocean region are more globally consequential. At the land border, the difficult terrain and more even balance of military force means that each side could only eke out minor, strategically modest gains at best. In contrast, India has traditionally been the dominant power in the Indian Ocean region and stands to cede significant political influence and security if it fails to answer the expansion of Chinese military power. China, correspondingly, stands to gain the ability to secure its critical sea lines of communication — thereby eliminating a major strategic vulnerability — and potentially decisive leverage in its strategic competition against India. [\\[77\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn77) The sheer size and complexity of the Indian Ocean region offers China a wide menu of new options to degrade India’s influence, threaten its interests, and pressure it militarily. For years, China has underwritten a trenchant rival in Pakistan. But more recently, it has also cultivated security partnerships in India’s other neighbours, from Sri Lanka to Bangladesh to Burma.

Gaining a competitive advantage in the Indian Ocean, therefore, is the real prize — a far more strategically significant threat to Indian power than the more heavily militarised and violence-prone LAC. Was this Beijing’s plan all along? Its motivations for the crisis have been notoriously obscure. But provoking such a crisis, with its predictable effects, is certainly consistent with the PLA’s view of India, as a weaker but nettlesome potential spoiler. The 2013 edition of the _Science of Military Strategy_ — the latest version of the PLA’s most authoritative strategic text — sees India as a rising power, extending its influence in all directions: “\\[India’s\\] strategic deployments will be reflected more in its intentions to control the South Asian subcontinent and the Indian Ocean, and it will give more stress to paying attention to both the land and the sea.” [\\[81\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn81) India’s growing power, then, would logically impede China’s quest for greater access and control of the “two oceans region”, encompassing the western Pacific and northern Indian Oceans — and neutralising Indian opposition to China would be a high strategic priority for Beijing. [\\[82\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn82) > Whether or not China intended the original Ladakh incursions as a competitive-strategy ploy, it now has a foundation to use the crisis in that way. Redoubling India’s focus on its land borders would also be consistent with a “competitive strategies” approach, in which the objective is to compel the adversary into making less productive or less threatening strategic investments. [\\[83\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn83) India’s traditional focus on its continental threats, its sensitivities over defending every inch of national territory, its historical neuralgia about the shock of the 1962 war, and its struggles to modernise its military are established features of Indian strategic behaviour, and would all have been well known in Beijing. China simply had to issue a nudge — a relatively minor military action in its Ladakh incursions — to reinforce and amplify India’s prior biases and activate its military-organisational instincts. The stimulus of the incursions then cascaded predictably through the machinery of the Indian government and military. Whether or not China intended the original Ladakh incursions as a competitive-strategy ploy, it now has a foundation to use the crisis in that way. If it detects unusual circumspection from New Delhi — including, for example, moves to fortify the Andaman and Nicobar Islands — then it need only ratchet up the tension or violence on the LAC. Beijing could use further aggressiveness from the PLA — the threat of further incursions, or even the possibility of accidental conflict — to deliberately generate risk on the border, to again defer India’s oceanic ambitions. Whether or not this was by design, the new strategic reality of political distrust and the increased militarisation of the LAC now provide a useful context in which any tactically minor PLA manoeuvre will be magnified, eliciting outsized strategic concerns in India. In their strategic competition, China has set the conditions for India to react in ways that suit China’s ambitions. ## China incurred only marginal costs As the Ladakh crisis prolonged troop deployments on both sides, month after month, it inevitably imposed material costs on each military. [\\[84\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn84) Some analysts claim that these costs will disproportionately fall on China, so the crisis should benefit India in the strategic competition. This may be because the PLA’s deployment on the LAC will require a longer and more elaborate logistics chain than the Indian Army’s — the LAC is more distant from major Chinese garrisons, and the PLA less accustomed to operating in its harsh environment. [\\[85\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn85) Or it may be because heavier militarisation will finally make the LAC as costly for China as it long has been for India. Put another way, these arguments contend that the ‘LoC-isation’ of the LAC is a net positive for India, because the ‘cost-exchange ratio’ favours India — that is, the marginal costs of additional militarisation are greater for China than they are for India. This may or may not be true — reliable data are scarce. It is unclear how much the Indian military has spent on the crisis — budget documents reveal in 2020 the Army and Air Force made unplanned expenditures for stores and other consumable expenses of over INR 68 billion (approximately US$908 million), and unplanned capital outlays for construction works and other equipment of over INR 141 billion (approximately US$1.88 billion). [\\[86\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn86) This was probably mostly, though not entirely, crisis-related emergency expenditure on infrastructure for deployed forces and munitions for aircraft. These forces have, to date, occupied hurriedly constructed and austere positions; as India decides to make its enlarged deployment in Ladakh more permanent, the construction of larger and better-equipped fixed bases and their supporting transport and energy infrastructure will incur heavier costs. There are no comparable estimates of costs on the Chinese side. Given the opacity of the Chinese system, even top-line estimates of the overall defence budget vary widely. Estimates of the PLA force levels at the LAC, usually leaked by Indian government sources, also feature suspiciously round numbers — such as 50 battalions — and are suspiciously comparable to Indian force levels. [\\[87\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn87) Even without reliable data, and even if the cost-exchange ratio did favour India, China is better positioned to weather the operational and strategic effects. No doubt the PLA’s new deployments and supporting infrastructure have been costly. But the _relative_ cost of this increased militarisation — its impost on the defence budget — is likely to be more manageable in China, because China’s defence budget is three to four times larger than India’s. [\\[88\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn88) Over the longer term, if and when disengagement occurs, the PLA may determine it can meet its operational requirements with fewer troops than India. After the Doklam crisis, the PLA reportedly stationed one brigade near the standoff site, in Yadong.

But for precisely that reason, it would probably have been welcomed as a field test of the PLA’s recent reorganisation and its joint combat service support capabilities, and as an opportunity to rotate inexperienced troops through an operational environment.

Thus, even if the PLA were to reinforce the LAC to a level comparable with India, such a reinforcement would have negligible impost on China’s defence resources or priorities. The personnel and equipment burden could be easily absorbed by the Western Theatre Command and would not — contrary to some analyses [\\[94\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn94) — disrupt the existing allocation of resources dedicated to China’s existing priorities. In contrast to the easily absorbed material costs, the political cost of the Ladakh crisis was probably more vexing for China. Even if China successfully imposed a fait accompli territorial revision, that gain may have come at the expense of a much more valuable, albeit rocky, overall relationship with India. Following the Ladakh incursions, India openly signalled two related political costs: that the crisis would disrupt the economic relationship with China; and that it would compel India to deepen its security relationship with the United States. In both cases, the threat of more harm to come was worse than the direct impact of Indian actions during the crisis. India has not broken off relations with China or entered into an alliance with the United States, but it signalled that it could easily move in those directions — and it was that coercive threat of yet-unrealised harm that probably motivated China. > Strategically, the PLA is unlikely to shift any additional resources to its Western Theatre Command, in part because it is already ponderously large, with over 200 000 soldiers. Both of these threats grew significantly more pronounced after the 15 June skirmish in the Galwan Valley in which Indian soldiers were killed. Indian domestic opinion turned decisively against China — the government would henceforth face less domestic resistance to taking a harder line against China.

Even if those measures did not in themselves impose significant costs on China, New Delhi judged that holding the future economic relationship at risk, rather than the local balance of military power, was its best source of bargaining leverage. The corollary of India’s threat to rupture the relationship with China was the threat to deepen its partnership with the United States. Soon after the June skirmish in Galwan, some analysts relished the prospect of India abandoning the fig-leaf of nonalignment and joining the US-led camp in a new Cold War against China. [\\[97\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn97) Adding credibility to this threat, the United States reportedly provided intelligence support and emergency supplies of extreme-weather clothing to the Indian Army reinforcements on the LAC.

[\\[99\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn99) India also deepened its commitment to the quadrilateral coalition (Quad) with the United States, Japan, and Australia — it finally acceded to Australia’s inclusion in the MALABAR naval exercise in November 2020, and participated in the Quad’s first stand-alone ministerial-level meeting in October 2020 and its first-ever national leaders’ summit in March 2021. Such advancement of the Quad partnership was very likely propelled by New Delhi’s sharpened threat perceptions of China. While deepening quadrilateral cooperation was more symbolic than substantive, the notion of a coalition of capable partners has consistently irked Beijing, and New Delhi very likely intended these steps as a political signal of greater alignment to come. [\\[100\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn100) To some extent, China had already accounted for these political costs. According to some estimates, Beijing regards an India–US compact as a predetermined, structural reality of geopolitics, an unavoidable byproduct of China’s rise, and unaffected by China’s policy actions. [\\[101\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn101) In this view, the India–US partnership may actually have enabled and emboldened India, giving it added confidence to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s autonomy and to press ahead with military infrastructure construction near the LAC. [\\[102\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn102) If China is indeed convinced that India was already ‘lost’, it would calculate it had nothing further to lose from continued belligerence or future provocations. [\\[103\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn103) Indeed, according to Chinese analyses published after the Galwan skirmish — presumably more strident as a result — Beijing’s strategic elite portrayed the crisis as the product of an anti-China government in New Delhi that has bound itself to American policy. China’s strategy, therefore, should be focused on subduing India — demonstrating that China is the superior power that can impose its will — as a function of China’s larger strategic competition with the United States. [\\[104\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn104) Nor is there compelling evidence that the Ladakh crisis has diminished China in the eyes of regional states. For many Southeast Asian countries, China already looms large as an aggressor because of these countries’ own territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, and those suspicions were only reinforced by China’s anger over investigations into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. [\\[105\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn105) Beyond that, the Ladakh crisis is largely seen as a particular India–China problem, and regional officials have been careful to maintain a studied neutrality in public. [\\[106\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn106) Nevertheless, Beijing’s agreement to disengage suggests the political costs did shape its calculus. China’s broader strategic context likely played a critical role in its decision-making. In particular, the CCP has grown concerned over “profound changes unseen in a century” [\\[107\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn107) — a current moment of instability accelerated by the pandemic and resulting anti-globalisation impulses. Following the deadly clash at Galwan and the Indian occupation of the Kailash Range peaks, Beijing was probably also sensitised to the risks of an unwanted war. The continuing presence of large combat formations in close contact with the adversary represented an unplanned and ongoing risk for China. In this environment, the CCP’s priority is to ease external pressures that challenge China’s economic development and national rejuvenation — including the formation of counterbalancing coalitions — and reduce the number of risks it faces. [\\[108\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn108) > The first phase of the disengagement plan included the withdrawal of the Indian forces that had occupied the Kailash Range peaks, thereby expending India’s only military leverage gained since the crisis began. In that context, India’s strategy of deliberately generating the risk of a broader rupture in the bilateral relationship probably took on added salience, and China had little more to gain. On the ground, the PLA was quickly satisfied with the operational gains of its incursions. As Ret Lieutenant General H S Panag, a former commander of the Indian Army’s Northern Command, observed, the disengagement plan in effect recognises most of China’s expansive 1959 claim lines, albeit with some provisional restrictions on patrolling and troop positions. [\\[109\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn109) More broadly, this would also have satisfied the need to clarify the balance of power, with China imposing its will on India. Those goals achieved, China had signalled it was willing to pull back its forces as early as June 2020 in a disengagement plan that led to and was derailed by the Galwan Valley skirmish. Satisfied on the ground, and facing unrelenting pressure on multiple foreign fronts, Beijing seems to have calculated that enduring Indian enmity would serve no useful purpose. Indeed, much of the costs that China did bear have diminished since the disengagement agreement was struck. The first phase of the disengagement plan included the withdrawal of the Indian forces that had occupied the Kailash Range peaks, thereby expending India’s only military leverage gained since the crisis began. The establishment of buffer zones also reduces the risk of accidental confrontations which may have concerned Beijing. India also rolled back some of the restrictions on Chinese foreign direct investment in India, which had been imposed as a punitive threat early in the crisis. [\\[110\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn110) These Indian military and economic concessions were important acts of assurance that signalled to China that there are benefits to resolving the crisis. For China, however, they not only reduced India’s direct pressure but, perhaps more importantly, they signalled that India was at least pausing the threatened deterioration in relations. For the time being, at least, the political costs would stop accumulating and in fact greatly declined. The costs China suffered in the crisis, therefore, were mostly political rather than material, more threatened rather than realised, and largely reduced when the disengagement plan was agreed. New Delhi’s strategy of threatening a major break in bilateral relations doubtless served to sharpen the choice for Beijing, but other global pressures were necessary enabling conditions. A similar Indian policy may not work as effectively next time. And the political cost did not thwart China’s objectives of asserting its LAC claims or asserting its dominant national power; it allowed India to extract a face-saving disengagement plan but did not coerce China into any concessions. As the strategic competition enters the next phase after disengagement, whatever political costs Beijing faced have been significantly diminished. It emerges from the crisis largely unscathed. ## Conclusions and Recommendations Disengagement is not conciliation. Even if it proceeds without incident — a big if — disengagement merely marks a new phase in India’s strategic competition with China. As a matter of policy, New Delhi has now placed the border dispute at the centre of India–China relations. Unless the two sides reach a new modus vivendi, competition will continue unabated. Even with new confidence-building measures, in the absence of a comprehensive boundary settlement, the wider relationship will remain vulnerable to destabilising disruptions. Some analysts insist that a settlement to delineate and demarcate the LAC is now feasible. [\\[111\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn111) Working towards that ultimate goal would certainly be worthy of Indian policymakers’ efforts — a verifiable settlement would unshackle the Indian military from at least part of its continental burden and remove the single greatest impediment to more mutually-profitable bilateral relations. But absent such a breakthrough, the PLA will continue to develop significant new military capabilities within operational reach of the LAC, as it did after the Doklam crisis, and as its policies for national rejuvenation prescribe. And it will continue to expand its military footprint in the Indian Ocean region as part of its long-term plan to project maritime power. The central challenge for India will be balancing these strategic priorities on land and at sea. This will be the subsequent and even more acute crisis in Indian defence policy. To manage that crisis after the crisis, Indian decision-makers must examine the hard-won lessons of Ladakh. The crisis has highlighted three particular lessons that New Delhi should internalise and use to shape its future approach to strategic competition with China. - **_Ensure any military strategy to counter coercion is centred on denial, not punishment:_** The Indian military’s standing doctrine calls for deterring adversaries with the threat of a massive punitive retaliation for any aggression, capturing enemy territory as bargaining leverage in post-war talks. [\\[112\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn112) But this did not deter China from launching unprecedented incursions in May 2020, and the threat lost credibility when retaliation never materialised. Punishment is generally less effective than denial, and especially so against highly resolved adversaries like China. [\\[113\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn113) In contrast, the Indian military’s high-water mark in the crisis was an act of denial — its occupation of the heights on the Kailash Range on its side of the LAC in late August. A doctrinal focus on denial will give the Indian military greater capacity to thwart future land grabs across the LAC. It would require a suite of improved capabilities and practices, including more wide-area surveillance, more devolved command authority, and well-practiced tactics for responding to attempted incursions. By bolstering India’s defensive position, rather than launching an escalatory response, such a strategy is also more likely than punishment to preserve crisis stability. Over time, improved denial capabilities may allow India to reduce the resource drain of the increased militarisation of the LAC. But denial is important not only in deterring territorial aggression — it is equally essential to counter coercion elsewhere, such as against third-party countries in the Indian Ocean. - **_Ensure any strategy to coerce China prioritises the coordinated imposition of political, rather than material, costs:_** To the extent that the crisis is evolving in a way that serves Indian national security interests — with disengagement to lines that approximate the status quo ante — it is because Beijing responded to the prospect of intolerable political costs, not material costs. India successfully raised the risks of the crisis for China, but through its threat of a political rupture, not military punishment. A permanently hostile India or an accidental escalation to conflict were risks that China, having achieved its goals in the crisis, assessed were an unnecessary additional burden while it was contending with a generally unstable international environment. The corollary lesson is that individual powers, even large powers like India, will probably struggle to shift Beijing’s calculus alone. China responded to the cumulative effect of multiple pressure points. Against the rising behemoth, only coordinated or collective action is likely to be effective. - **_Consider accepting more risk on the LAC in exchange for long-term leverage and influence in the Indian Ocean region:_** The Ladakh crisis has ushered in a new strategic reality — with the increased militarisation of the LAC at its core — that may hasten shifts in the balance of power in the Indian Ocean region. Mitigating that risk will require New Delhi to make tough-minded strategic trade-offs, deliberately prioritising military modernisation and joint force projection over the traditional ground-centric combat arms formations required to defend territory on the northern border. A more competitive long-term posture that consolidates influence in the Indian Ocean may come at the price of accepting more ground incursions. This will be a politically formidable task — blood has now been spilled on the LAC, and for domestic political reasons India cannot be seen to be passive on the border. But it will be a fundamentally political task. Rebalancing India’s strategic priorities will require the central government, through the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), to issue firm strategic guidance to the military services. This response will be a test not only of the government’s strategic sense and farsightedness, but also of the national security apparatus’ ability to overcome entrenched bureaucratic and organisational-cultural biases. Absent bold leadership, the inertia of the military services will guarantee that India suffers a crisis after the crisis. Ladakh’s long-term effects also entail risks for other countries, including India’s partners such as Australia. Canberra’s interests were not directly imperilled by Ladakh, but they would be greatly implicated if it undermines India’s capacity to compete with China. Australia, along with the United States, is crafting security policies for the Indo-Pacific that include a powerful India as a key assumption. Australia and the United States each regard the Indian Ocean as vital, but ultimately of secondary importance in their defence posture, behind Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, respectively. Accordingly, they have sought to deepen strategic relations with India on the premise that a capable and likeminded India would, of its own volition, counterbalance China’s military expansion into the Indian Ocean. An India that is, conversely, newly recommitted to focusing on its land border with China is less likely to take an expanded security role in the Indian Ocean, leaving Australia’s interests exposed to growing Chinese power. Absent an actively engaged India, Australia may then find itself in a reactive posture, struggling and probably failing to build the political relationships and military capabilities to offset China’s explosive political and military growth. The Ladakh crisis’ effects are not predetermined; India and its constituent institutions still have agency. They may yet survey the new strategic reality and understand the risks of doubling down on the LAC, and choose instead to direct greater attention to the Indian Ocean region. Or they may yet commit anew to a deeper strategic partnership with the United States, pressing ahead with innovative programs, for example in combined contingency planning. But there is little evidence to date of those trajectories. Much of India’s future course will depend on how the crisis is framed in official and elite narratives. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the Combined Commanders’ Conference in March 2021, made appropriate references to the need for modernisation, but also issued a typically bombastic call for the military to be “battle-ready at all times”. [\\[114\\]](https://lowyinstituteforintpolicy.sharepoint.com/sites/ResearchDirector/Shared%20Documents/RESEARCH%20EDITOR/Clare%20Caldwell/Lowy%20ANALYSES/TARAPORE%20India-China%20Border%20Crisis/210429%20crisis%20after%20crisis%20v5%20-%20after%20final%20edits%20(2)%20FINAL%2005_05_21.docx#_edn114) In terms of tangible resources and entrenched organisational preferences, early indications suggest that a more heavily militarised and violence-prone LAC will be the crisis’ central strategic legacy — and its effects are largely negative for India’s competition with China. ## Notes Banner image: An Indian Army soldier stands in front of a group of People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China soldiers as they line up after participating in an anti-terror drill during the Sixth India-China Joint Training exercise \"Hand in Hand 2016\" at HQ 330 Infantry Brigade, in Aundh in Pune district, some 145km southeast of Mumbai, on 25 November 2016.

The government provides support for the rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists, the SP said, adding that the Maoist leaders were terrorising innocent tribals and forcing them to join the banned Maoist party to engage them in illegal activities for their selfish interests. Knowingly and unknowingly, some went underground and now find it difficult to join the mainstream of life. **Read less...** | | May - 2 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders are resorting to acts of violence in Bhadradri Kothagudem District of Telangana, said Bhadrachalam, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Paritosh Pankaj, on May 2, reports Telangana Today.

In a statement, ASP Pankaj said, Maoists were committing criminal offences to show their presence and harassing the innocent tribal people of the agency areas. The Naxals \\[Left Wing extremists, LWEs\\] have become obstacles to development. The top leaders of the Maoist party were compelling their lower-level cadres to commit illegal activities with the aim of extorting money and troubling innocent tribals in many ways for their selfish interests. Minor boys and girls were being tortured by the Naxals forcing them to join the Maoist party. The ASP noted that many cadres attracted by the ‘Operation Chayutha’ are planning to surrender, but they were being prevented doing so by Maoist top leadership. **Read less...** | | May - 11 | Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. In a statement the official said that Maoist top leadership for the wellbeing of their family members have been making the lower ranks scapegoats. Innocent Adivasi youths were being forced to join the Maoist party and giving them arms to attack Police forces. For the selfish needs of Maoists, the lives of Adivasi boys and girls were being spoiled as they were deprived of education. Maoists like Sodi Jogaiah, Rajesh, Sodi Mada and others, killed in encounters, were made to join the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] when they were minor in age and the party top leadership should take responsibility for their deaths, the SP said.

Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas. The Maoists are also developing drones to carry and drop up to five kilograms of explosives on Police Stations. In the latest issue of their mouthpiece, the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] claim to have well responded to the aerial attacks and surveillance in Chhattisgarh with their counter strategy. **Read less...** | | July - 15 | To choke the flow of funds to Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists (LWEs)\\] in the state, the Bihar Police has intensified its crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts, reports Deccan Herald on July 16.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger.

The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

    "title": "Communal Riots and Its Psychological Impact: A Systematic Review Study in Indian Context",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "## Abstract ### Objective In the Indian setting, communal riots characterized by intergroup violence have been common and have had an impact on the lives of both people and communities. The goal of this systematic review is to investigate the psychological effects of Indian communal riots in depth. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, the study aims to identify recurring themes, patterns, and variances in the psychological effects encountered by victims of community violence. ### Methods The researcher searched Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO for research published between the year 2000 and the year 2022 in each of these databases. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was employed to evaluate the study’s quality. ### Results After identifying 1189 publications in all, 195 of them were chosen for full-text examination, and 41 research were ultimately included. Twenty studies examined depression and mental health with a prevalence rate of 49%. Five studies (12%) examined post-traumatic stress disorder. In places devastated by riots, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder varied from 4% to 41%. Other studies investigated anxiety, alcohol abuse, and homelessness. However, two studies revealed that group activities could lower depression and suicide rates, perhaps as a result of increased social cohesiveness and group catharsis among subpopulations. ### Conclusion The researcher investigated the connection between collective activities and mental health in this systematic review, providing strong evidence that riots, protests, and other collective actions—even peaceful ones—can harm mental health outcomes. Thus, healthcare providers must be aware of the psychological and emotional effects of riots, revolutions, and demonstrations. It is essential to do more study on this newly identified sociopolitical driver of mental health. **Keywords:** communal riots, psychological well-being, systematic review * * * Over 180 nations, or 99% of the world’s population, have experienced collective activities including protests, riots, and revolutions over the past few decades. [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0001), [2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0002) Globally, they are growing, [3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0003), [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0004) however, it’s still not quite understood how group action affects mental health. Much more research has been done on the impact of armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, natural catastrophes, and man-made disasters on the mental health of huge populations. [5–8](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0005) These researches demonstrate higher levels of resilience and psychopathology in the face of widespread community trauma, although it is yet unknown how collective behaviors relate to healthcare professionals. A different area of study is required since collective activities vary from further significant population events in nature. As a result, we thoroughly examined studies on global collective action and mental health. India is a multi-religious country. In the nation, various religions and their adherents can be found. India is a secular nation, so it emphasizes the equality of people and humanity. However, on occasion, because of careless mistakes and flaws, our nation experiences some issues that degrade and humiliate mankind. Communal riots are one of them. One of the biggest issues with human rights now is communal violence or conflict between groups who define themselves by their differences from one another. But compared to earlier decades, the violence that has persisted over the last 20 years is different. The current sectarian violence is not the fault of any one extremist organization, but rather of the governments that use inter-group animosity to achieve power. These systemic causes of intergroup conflict pose a challenge to the foundational values of democracy and equality. Identity politics is the root cause of current racial violence. Identity politics, whether based on race, sex, caste, class, language, religion, or national or regional origin, emphasize the group aspect of rights, experiences, and identities. In many instances, the political-culture forces involved in identity politics want to impose their political dominance, cultural hegemony, and major legal changes. Communal riots are fairly common throughout the country as a result of all these conflicts. Mumbai, Moradabad, Meerut, Gujarat, and Aligarh are the areas of India that are most sensitive. Religious festivals and places of worship have been the most apparent root of conflicts between communities. However, various economic and political causes have deepened and aggravated the split between the two populations beneath the pattern of injured religious sentiments. These have included controversial British colonial practices, economic sanctions imposed on Muslim textile workers in the 1930s, and other types of economic rivalry existing before separation. In 1969, there was the deadliest communal violence since independence, marking the start of the state’s partisan involvement and the emergence of a link between politicians and criminals. Political parties play a crucial role in building positive links between the communities. Political parties are organizations where people are free to express their opinions and ideals publicly. The democratic social structure and political parties give people the chance to express their opinions. From [Table 1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t0001) we can see communal riots have increased in India between 2019–2020. A major increase can be seen in communal/religious incidents and riots ie 96%. ## Table 1. Rioting Offences (Courtesy: NCRB Data, 2020) | Nature of Offence | 2019 | 2020 | %Raise/Fall | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Rioting while in “andolan/morcha” | 1442 | 1905 | +32% | | Rioting/attacks on police personnel or Govt. servants | 1054 | 616 | −42% | | Other riots | 20,363 | 21,766 | +7% | | Communal/religious incidents | 438 | 857 | +96% | With a particular focus on understanding the psychological effects of these events on individuals and communities, the goal of this systematic review and synthesis of the literature on communal riots in the Indian context is to identify patterns, common themes, and variances in psychological outcomes associated with communal violence in India. ## Methods ### Search Strategy and Selection Criteria Our study protocol was pre-specified and registered in PROSPERO (PROSPERO: CRD42023480295). We adhered to the PRISMA standards, [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0009) which are the recommended reporting elements for meta-analyses and systematic reviews. This systematic review is conducted on communal riots and their psychological impact on the Indian population so all study was chosen based on the Indian context. Studies that were written in English and distributed in scholarly journals were selected. All study types, including cross-sectional and longitudinal, qualitative and quantitative, were covered in this investigation. The research needed to provide a report any psychiatric diagnoses, admissions, prescriptions, symptoms, or distress of those directly or indirectly impacted by a recognized collective action to fulfil the requirements for inclusion in the outcome. Studies based on labor conflicts were left out because they sought to alter how resources or positions were distributed within an organization. Events involving protracted, paramilitary wars orchestrated by states or individuals with state-like characteristics were also disregarded. Searches were conducted in Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and PsycINFO for studies released between the beginning of each database’s existence from 2000 to 2022. We also looked through the references in the retrieved publications to find other studies. Search terms included “riots”, “protest”, “unrest”, “civil disorders”, “demonstration”, “revolution”, and “campaign”, as well as terms for social movements that use collective activities as a strategy, such as “social movement”, “political movement”, and “socio-political movement”. These were used to find prospective publications addressing group activity and mental health results, in addition to phrases like “mental health”, “mental disorders”, “behavioral symptoms”, and “psychological”. An illustration of the thorough search plan is shown in [Table 2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t0002). #### Table 2. Electronic Search Strategy for PubMed | Database | Search | Filters/Limits | | --- | --- | --- | | PubMed | “Protest” \\[All Fields\\] OR “revolution” \\[All Fields\\] OR “Civil Disorders” \\[Mesh\\] OR “civil disobedience” \\[All Fields\\] OR “demonstration” \\[All Fields\\]) OR “social movement” \\[All Fields\\] OR “political movement” \\[All Fields\\] OR “campaign” \\[All Fields\\] AND (“Mental Health” \\[Mesh\\] OR “Mental Disorders” \\[Mesh\\] OR “Behavioural Symptoms” \\[Mesh\\] OR psychological \\[All Fields\\]) | Humans English | After retrieving, the published articles were independently reviewed by the researcher for inclusion, and any disagreements were settled. The researcher first looked at the titles and abstracts to evaluate if the publications fit the inclusion requirements. The complete texts of the articles were carefully reviewed after the first two rounds of screening, and those that met the exclusion criteria were eliminated. ### Evidence Grading The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), which is advised by the Cochrane Collaboration for the assessment of non-randomized trials, was used by the author to independently grade the standard of methodology across all included research. [10](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0010) Concerning earlier adaptations, [11](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0011), [12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0012) the NOS was updated for the evaluation of cross-sectional research quality. ### Synthesis of Results The data have been summarized by outcomes related to mental health. The researcher prioritized findings from longitudinal studies first, and where none were available, we evaluated cross-sectional studies with high NOS values under systematic review procedures. [13](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0013) We prioritized data based on random samples taken from the general population when determining the incidence of mental health outcomes. ## Results ### Description of Studies There were 1189 items found in the first search. We found 41 papers after implementing the prerequisites for inclusion and exclusion and looking through the research contained in the reference lists ( [Figure 1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#f0001)). A total of 23,132 persons were involved in this study, which included 16 cross-sectional, 4 systematic reviews, 4 surveys, 3 observational, 3 exploratory, 3 epidemiological, 3 explanatory mixed methods, and 5 qualitative research (not including time series and qualitative studies without a sample size specification). [Table 2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t0002) and “[Supplementary Table 1](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=455783.pdf)” summarise the study designs and main findings from all the selected research. #### Figure 1. PRISMA Flow Diagram. **Note**: This diagram shows the systematic process we followed to include papers captured by our search. ### Sample Characteristics Eight studies used random samples, some drawn from the general population, [14](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0014), [15](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0015) others by sex, [16](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0016), [17](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0017) remaining from affected communities. [18](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0018), [19](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0019) This research includes a representative sample study that illustrates the nation’s diversity, considering factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, urban-rural distribution, and socioeconomic status. Inclusivity is vital, encompassing various geographic regions: Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western India. Moreover, urban and rural populations, as well as tribal communities, are also included for a comprehensive view. The number of study participants ranged from 17 to 22,377, with ten studies having participants greater than 5000, twelve investigations involving over than 300–850 individuals, six studies recruiting a population of more than 150, as well as two studies with less than 100 participants. ### Examination of Mental Health Outcomes From [Table 3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t0003) we can check that the most often examined outcome was depression and mental health concerns, which were noted in a third of the studies (n = 20, 48.78%), followed by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n = 5, 12.19%) and anxiety disorder/anxiety symptoms (n = 6, 14.63%). Other effects included an increase in alcohol use disorder, homelessness, and a high chance of poverty. ( [Table 3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t0003)). #### Table 3. Outcome of the Systematic Review | Study Design | Number of Studies (%) | | --- | --- | | Cross-sectional | 16 (25) | | Qualitative studies | 5 (12) | | Surveys | 4 (10) | | Systematic Review | 4 (10) | | Observational | 3 (7) | | Exploratory | 3 (7) | | Epidemiological | 3 (7) | | Explanatory mixed methods | 3 (7) | | **Sample sizea** | | 1–100 | 2 (5) | | 100–300 | 6 (15) | | 300–850 | 12 (29) | | ≥5000 | 10 (24) | | **Outcomeb** | | Depression and mental health | 20 (49) | | Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) | 5 (12) | | Anxiety disorder | 6 (15) | | Alcohol use disorder | 5 (12) | | Homelessness | 5 (12) | | High chance of poverty | 4 (10) | ## Discussion This is, as far as we are aware, the first comprehensive analysis of collective activities and mental health. The two most often researched mental health consequences of mass actions, riots, and social unrest are depression and PTSD. [15](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0015), [20–22](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0020) Notably, the frequency of depression and PTSD after mass gatherings appears to be equivalent to those who have been victims of violence, riots and social unrest in both the general population and among victims of violence. [15](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0015), [20](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0020), [23](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0023), [24](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0024) Individual characteristics (such as poor socioeconomic status, female sex, psychological resilience, health status, and social support), the nature of the event itself (such as being exposed to violence, coverage in the media, and level of engagement), and post-event situations (such as loss of personal as well as social resources), Unemployment rates were indicators of risk for psychopathology following collective actions. [14](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0014), [16](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0016), [25–28](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0025) According to some evidence (n = 5; 12% of the included studies), collective acts might also linked to enhanced mental health, including a reduction in depression and suicides. [18](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0018), [29–32](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0029) This conclusion might be clarified by the fact that when individuals voice their frustrations collectively, it can be cathartic. Additionally, stronger social links among subpopulations that are either in favor of or against the collective action’s cause might improve social bonds, which in turn could mitigate the negative effects of the stressful environment. [18](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0018), [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0031), [32](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0032) Therefore, different means must be used for nonviolent collective action to affect health. The effect of riots on mental health might be explained by the stressors and stress assessment processes. [33](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0033) Stress reactivity refers to an increased risk of mental illness following stress exposure, whereas stressors are operationalized as external pressures that test a person’s potential for adaptation. [14](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0014), [34](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0034), [35](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0035) The first domain of the Research Domain Criteria matrix [36](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0036) recognizes the significance of stress reactivity in the appearance of mental diseases. As an outcome, exposure to stress and an individual’s stress response might be seen as the causes of threat for mental health illnesses after collective activities. [14](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0014), [18](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0018) Conflicts between individuals and the interruption of healthcare services are examples of how collective activities may create stress. [37](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0037), [38](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0038) Similar to this, the function of social relationships in reducing stress may help to explain the protective impact of social support. [39–41](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0039) ## Strengths and Limitations Although completing small-scale investigations cannot indicate the incidence of psychological morbidities in this research, this review has methodically documented existing data, highlighted the research gap, and highlighted the necessity for more in-depth research. However, there are some limitations to our review. In comparison to the population in India, the population that some researchers we synthesized addressed is small. In addition, the majority of the research was cross-sectional, and the techniques and instruments employed varied widely. Therefore, it is impossible to generalize the results of these investigations. Cross-study comparisons are challenging since various mental health metrics were used in the research. According to Galea and Maxwell (2009), validated standardized measures or diagnostic interviews should be used in future research to evaluate mental health. Lastly, even though Higgins and Green (2012a) of the Cochrane Collaboration suggest using the NOS to assess the excellence of non-randomized research, the NOS was only intended for cohort and case-2 studies. However, to evaluate cross-sectional research, the NOS has been adjusted in light of earlier evaluations. [11](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0011), [12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0012) Another limitation of this study is that the articles included in the review were screened by a single reviewer. The lack of additional reviewers may have increased the likelihood of bias or oversight in the selection of papers, despite attempts to assure completeness and correctness in the screening process. Multiple reviewers might improve the robustness and dependability of the literature review process in future research. In conclusion, according to this systematic study, within the previous three decades, there has been very little community-based research on issues related to mental health among indigenous groups. Of them, even fewer studies focused exclusively on tribal communities. A limited range of mental health issues, primarily alcoholism, anxiety, depression and suicide were explored by these investigations. Despite the rise in collective activities throughout the world and their known effects on mental health, [3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#cit0003) collective actions are frequently underappreciated as a sociopolitical factor influencing mental health. The assessment of how communal activities affect mental health and the underlying mechanisms has just recently started in the literature. Therefore, it would be appropriate to research this new area of study. ## Funding Statement This research was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia (Grant No. GrantA119). ## Disclosure The author declares no conflicts of interest in this work. ## References - 1.Tarrow SG. _Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics_.

The measures aim to ‘maintain public safety and curb the spread of misinformation.’ In the past one week, violence in Manipur has taken a turn for the worse, with reports of ‘militants turning to newer technologies such as drones and rockets’ and adding a fresh layer of violence even as the use of rifles and grenade continued unabated. The context of this latest escalation is however the continued failure of the state and central governments, both ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to take any steps to arrest the violence and conflict. Internet services, including mobile data, lease lines, VSATs, broadband, and VPNs, have been halted in the valley districts of Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Bishnupur, and Kakching. Initially, the suspension was set for the entire state, but it was later amended to cover only these five districts. The Manipur Home Department cited concerns that social media could be used to spread inflammatory content, incite public unrest, and damage public and private property. The decision was made to counteract the activities of those spreading false rumours and hate speech. In addition to the internet suspension, indefinite curfews have been imposed starting at 11:00 am on September 11 in Imphal East and Imphal West, restricting movement except for essential services and the media. According to the orders by the Manipur government, the internet ban will continue till September 15. Notably, Thoubal district has also enacted a similar curfew. The opposition Congress has urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah to intervene, calling for decisive action by security forces to restore order. The state education department has ordered the closure of all schools and colleges on September 11 and 12. Exams scheduled by Manipur University have been postponed until further notice. Drastic measures have been employed by the government after last week, when violence erupted in Manipur’s Jiribam district, leading to the deaths of six people, not for the first time. When protestors took to street and clashes took place, prohibitory orders were issued. These incidents have taken place in the state despite an agreement between representatives of Meitei and Hmar communities to restore normalcy and prevent further arson during a meeting held on August 1 at a CRPF facility in Assam’s Cachar district. The meeting, moderated by Jiribam district administration, Assam Rifles, and CRPF personnel, included representatives from the Hmar, Meitei, Thadou, Paite, and Mizo communities of Jiribam. For the past 16 months, ethnic violence has ravaged Manipur, a state of around 2.85 million people. The conflict has claimed 235 lives, left thousands wounded, and displaced hundreds of thousands. What started as a clash between the majority Meitei community and the tribal Kuki groups has now deepened into bitter, seemingly irreparable divisions within Manipuri society. **What led to the eruption of violence?** On Saturday, August 31, large-scale protests erupted across Manipur’s Churachandpur and Kangpokpi districts as members of the Kuki-Zo community took to the streets demanding a separate administration. These rallies, which also spread to other regions, were organised in response to what the Kuki-Zo community described as “genocide and ethnic cleansing,” reinforcing their call for autonomy through a separate administration. The protests were particularly intense in areas like Leishang (Churachandpur), Keithelmanbi (Kangpokpi), and Moreh (Tengnoupal). In Churachandpur, the protest began at the Anglo-Kuki War Gate and proceeded to Peace Ground in Tuibong, covering about 6 km. The rally led to the closure of markets and schools, and government offices saw notably low attendance despite the state government’s appeal for institutions to remain open. In Kangpokpi district, hundreds of protesters marched from Keithelmanbi Military Colony to Thomas Ground at the district headquarters, covering approximately 8 km. The said protests had been sparked by viral audio clips, allegedly featuring Chief Minister N. Biren Singh making inflammatory comments related to the ongoing conflict in Manipur. The 48-minute recording, purportedly made during a meeting with Chief Minister Singh, allegedly reveals his “partisan complicity” in the ongoing violence. As per the report of _The Wire,_ the voice said to be of the chief minister can be heard making light of the crime against the two Kuki women, who had been paraded naked and had survived sexual violence, and berating Meitei civil society groups for not coming out and “ _asserting boldly, with pride_” that “ _it is we, the Meiteis who saved them from the mob”_. _“How badly we were shamed! We should have taken credit for saving them, clothing them and sending them home,_” the recording captured the speaker as saying. The Kuki-Zo organizations submitted several memoranda to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The memoranda submitted by the Kuki Students’ Organisation (KSO) in Kangpokpi demanded action against the chief minister, the strengthening of buffer zones with Assam Rifles, and an immediate political solution under Article 239A. A day after the protest, violence erupted across the region. SabrangIndia reached out to locals on the ground to understand the underlying causes of this September unrest. Speaking on condition of anonymity, several sources suggested that the recent surge in violence was a deliberate attempt to mask Chief Minister Biren’s failure to manage the deteriorating situation in the state. According to these sources, CM Biren has been seeking to shift the focus away from growing calls for his resignation by requesting control over the unified command of state security forces from the union government. They allege that Biren, fully aware that this request would likely be denied, is positioning himself to shift blame onto the central government for the ongoing chaos. Furthermore, the Kuki-Zo communities express deep concern that, if granted control over both state and central forces, CM Biren could use this power to further his agenda of eliminating the Kuki community from Assam. **Details of the violent episodes in the past week:** Since September 1, eleven people have been killed in various incidents across Manipur, prompting large-scale student protests in Thoubal and Imphal. Among those killed is a former serviceman. The killings span multiple regions across the state – five people died in Jiribam, which shares a border with Assam, and the former army man was killed in Sekmai, a town close to Imphal which is roughly 250 kilometres from Jiribam. The violence erupted on September 1, when bombs were thrown for the first time in the Koutuk Kadangband village. An alleged drone attack killed a woman and injured nine others, including an 11-year-old, igniting protests and further clashes, as people took to the streets. It is essential to highlight here that sources from the ground have alleged that the news of using drones and bombs is false, and that bullets were the cause of the death of the deceased woman. On September 2, a day after the drone attack, the CM’s convoy was stopped while he was on the way to Koutruk and Senjam Chirang in Imphal West to meet a victim who was injured in the incident. Union Home Minister Amit Shah advised him to turn back, citing the risk of further attacks due to his presence in the area Protesters, who had set up camp overnight in Imphal’s Khwairamband women’s market, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding the removal of central forces, the state Director General of Police (DGP), and the Security Advisor. They also called for Chief Minister N. Biren Singh to assume control of the unified command of state security forces and for the suspension of agreements with Kuki-Zo militant groups. Despite an imposed curfew, protesters moved towards high-security zones in Imphal, including the Raj Bhawan and the Chief Minister’s residence, leading to confrontations with police and security forces. The clashes, which involved the use of tear gas by security forces, resulted in over 60 protesters being injured and taken to RIMS Imphal West for treatment. On September 4, arson erupted in Jiribam district after suspected ‘tribal village volunteers’ set a house on fire early Wednesday morning. The three-room house at Jakuradhor in the district belonged to a retired police officer. Describing the incident, the police stated that armed men struck around 3.30 am, taking advantage of the darkness to burn down the house, located 28 km from Jiribam district headquarters, near Hmar-dominated Pherzawl district. The police had provided that the family had vacated the property following previous violence in the district. On September 6, a 78-year-old man was killed and six others sustained injuries as suspected militants, which news reports are suggesting to be from the Kuki community, targeted former Chief Minister Mairembam Koireng’s residence in Bishnupur district by lobbing a “powerful bomb”. According to police, the alleged bomb was lobbed from a long range fell on the compound of former Chief Minister Koireng’s residence, killing the elderly man on the spot. Koireng and his family members were not in the house during the alleged bomb attack. It is essential to note that in some media reports, the bomb attack has been described as a rocket attack. A report of the Hindustan Times provided that senior officers have described the alleged bomb/rocket fired to be at least four-feet long. “It seems the explosives were filled in a galvanised iron (GI) pipe. The GI pipes with explosives were then fitted in a country-made rocket launcher and fired simultaneously. For the projectile to travel a longer distance, the militants have to change the volume of the explosives. It seems they have been practising this during the months of lull,” the officer had provided. The deceased, identified as R.K. Rabei was preparing for some local religious ceremony when the bomb exploded. Six others, including a 13-year-old girl, suffered splinter injuries and were shifted to the hospital. The “powerful bomb”, which was detonated remotely, fell at a spot that is around a few km from the Indian National Army (INA) headquarters. On September 7, another wave of violence was reported from Serou, Moljol, Rashidpur and Nungchappi villages in Jiribam district, adjoining southern Assam. As per the details provided on social media, suspected militants, which reports suggest were from the Kuki community, had been attacking different areas of the Jiribam district throughout the week, during which an elderly Meitei resident was killed while the victim was sleeping. As per the state police, after the death of the elderly man, who was an ex-serviceman, the police in “retaliation” killed four alleged militants. However, there is no clarity from the police who conducted the “retaliatory attack”. However, Kuki tribal leaders have claimed that the slain cadres were not militants, and were only “Village Volunteers”. As per a report of Hindustan Times, an officer of a security force posted in Manipur had provided that “A gunfight started in the morning after militants entered a village and killed a man. The killing was part of the ethnic clashes. The gunfight is on. We have reports that the ones who died are from both Kuki and Meitei communities.” Subsequently, armed assailants engaged in a heavy exchange of fire in the Nunchapi area, leading to the deaths of three allegedly armed Kuki men and one allegedly armed Meitei man. Tension escalated also at Sugnu in Kakching district, from where gunfire and bombing were reported. On September 8, a former army jawan, belonging to Kuki community, was allegedly beaten to death at Sekmai, a Meitei-dominated area in conflict-hit Manipur’s Imphal West. Kuki organisations said the victim, Limlal Mate, was attacked after he reportedly drove his car into the area by mistake on Sunday night as per the Hindustan Times. The body of Mate, a resident of Sharon Veng in Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi district, was found in a pool of blood on Monday. Sources in a Kuki organisation said he was a former army person. Mate had lost his wife a few years ago and was living with his son, a source said. **Protests by Meitei groups urging to union government to take action:** Hundreds of Meitei students took to the streets on September 9 in Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley, protesting against the drone attacks and demanding a change in the leadership of the state’s unified command responsible for security. According to a police statement, protesters threw stones and plastic bottles near the main gate of the state governor’s residence. In response, police deployed tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowd, resulting in around 45 protesters sustaining minor injuries, a police officer reported as per Reuters. Around 6pm, 10 students accompanied by social activist Rohan Philem were allowed inside Raj Bhavan. Student leader Ch Victor Singh said that protesters gave Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya 24 hours to respond to a list of demands, which includes the removal of the top police official in the state and the security adviser for their failure to control the violence, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. The Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), an umbrella organization of civil society groups, issued an ultimatum on Saturday, giving Central security forces a five-day deadline to “either take decisive action against Kuki militant groups or withdraw from the state.” In a statement, COCOMI expressed the growing distrust of the people of Manipur towards the central forces, particularly accusing the Assam Rifles of aiding Kuki extremists in their attacks on indigenous communities. COCOMI also announced that the “public emergency” declared on September 6 will remain in effect indefinitely. As part of this emergency, all public and private institutions, including markets, business establishments, and banks, are to remain closed. Roads will stay open only for emergency services, essential movements, and religious activities. Additionally, women’s groups and local clubs have been urged to prevent the movement of central armed forces in civilian areas and border zones if they fail to act against the alleged Kuki extremists. **Kuki-Zomi community protests against Assam Rifles withdrawal, demands union territory status** The Kuki Inpi Manipur, the apex body representing Kukis in the state, refuted claims made by the Manipur police on Tuesday regarding the use of drones to drop explosives. “Contrary to these allegations, the Kukis have never used drone bombs. It was, in fact, the Meiteis who first deployed drones in an attack on T Lailopjhai village on February 20, 2024,” the statement read. On September 9, thousands of Kuki-Zomi tribe members took to the streets of Kangpokpi District in protest against the proposed removal of Assam Rifles battalions. Organised by the Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU), the rally underscored the community’s growing security concerns amidst recent violence. The protesters demanded political and territorial separation from the Meitei community, advocating for Union Territory status with its own legislature. The demonstrators in Kangpokpi District Headquarters opposed the withdrawal of the 9 and 22 Battalions of Assam Rifles stationed in Kangpokpi and Churachandpur, warning that their removal would further destabilize the region. After the rally, the protesters convened for a massive public meeting, where they mourned the deaths of four Kuki-Zomi people killed in Jiribam on September 7. The meeting culminated in a powerful five-point declaration, wherein the Kuki-Zomi community vowed to defend their ancestral lands with unwavering determination. They pledged to respond forcefully to any attacks on their villages or people, making clear that future aggressions would be met with equal retribution. The Kuki-Zomi community also voiced strong opposition to any policies implemented by the Manipur government, which they accused of marginalizing them politically, socially, and academically while favouring Meitei groups. They rejected the government’s eight-point demand, viewing it as a threat to their survival. Reaffirming their non-negotiable demand for political and geographical separation from the Meitei community, the Kuki-Zomi tribe called for Union Territory status, a demand they declared unyielding. **Manipur govt launches major combing operation amid escalating violence and drone attacks, security forces on high alert:** A major combing operation has been launched in Manipur, following fresh violence in Jiribam district on September 7. Briefing reporters, inspector general of police (Intelligence) K Kabib had provided that a robust anti-drone system had been deployed in the tense areas and police are in the process of buying additional weapons to counter the attacks on civilians. “The state force is closely monitoring the situation and senior officers have been deployed on the ground. Due to the recent drone attacks, an anti-drone system has been deployed and the state police are in the process of purchasing additional anti-drone guns, which will be deployed soon,” he said, as per Economic Times. The union has formed a committee of top officers from the police, army and paramilitary forces to examine the use of explosive-bearing drones. The committee is now preparing a report that it will submit by September 13. As per the media reports, the security agencies have recovered large caches of weapons in a significant arms haul in the state. The seized weapons include sniper rifles, pistols, guns, short- and long-range mortars, grenades, and long-range rocket bombs, among other ammunition, according to the India Today report. As per the report of Hindustan Times, a total of 92 checkpoints have been set up across various districts in Manipur, both in the hills and the valley. So far, the police have detained 129 individuals for violations in different districts of the state. Manipur Governor Lakshman Acharya’s office also issued a statement on September 10 expressing “deep concern.” A statement issued by the Raj Bhawan read, “The Governor has said that violence is not the solution to any problem. In his bid to solve the problem with the help of the public, the Hon’ble Governor is constantly speaking to public leaders, students and the people.” On September 11, IGP (Administration) K. Jayanta Singh described the situation as critically serious, stressing that security forces are needed to address attacks in fringe areas. Singh noted that the ongoing student protests have forced the deployment of additional resources to manage the agitators, detracting from efforts to protect vulnerable areas. “During such difficult times, when security forces are needed to commit to protecting lives and properties in fringe areas from attacks, miscreants and anti-socials are taking opportunities of such an agitation to target security forces,” Singh said. Congress MP from Inner Manipur A. Bimol Akoijam wrote to Union Home minister Amit Shah and called for a “thorough investigation into allegations of involvement by illegal immigrants, foreign elements, and the illicit drug mafia in the ongoing unrest.” **Manipur CM urges Union to “safeguard territorial integrity amid rising violence, rejects Kuki-Zo demands for separate administration”** On Sunday, September 8, Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh reportedly called on the central government to take firm steps to protect the state’s territorial integrity. He also urged the Centre to reject demands from Kuki-Zo groups for a separate administration. Following the latest bout of violence, security was heightened across Manipur. Officials described the situation as tense but under control. Chief Minister Singh met Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya twice over the weekend, the second time on Sunday morning. During the meetings, Singh called for targeted operations by central security forces against militant camps in the hill regions. A source close to the matter told _The Hindu_ that Singh emphasized the need for a more “professional approach” to the crisis, which has been exacerbated by a drone attack in Imphal West on September 1. He also suggested that “subject experts” should be involved to address the situation more effectively. Following the clashes on September 7, Singh convened a meeting with ruling party legislators, which includes members of the BJP, Naga People’s Front, National People’s Party, and Janata Dal (United). According to a report in _The Indian Express_, the state government decided to press the Centre to take decisive action against insurgents. Singh, along with several Ministers and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) legislators, held a closed-door meeting with the Governor and submitted a memorandum, though its content has not been made public. Despite rumours, sources denied that Singh was considering resignation, stating that the meeting was intended to show unity and reassure the public that the government was working to manage the crisis. The escalation in violence, including a rocket attack, has intensified calls for stronger action. BJP MLA Rajkumar Imo Singh, son-in-law of Chief Minister Biren Singh, had earlier written to Home Minister Amit Shah, criticizing the central forces as “mute spectators” and questioning the effectiveness of their presence in restoring peace. Opposition leaders, such as Manipur Congress President Keisham Meghachandra Singh, have been vocal in their criticism of the Centre’s handling of the crisis. Meghachandra noted that the recent attacks have involved sophisticated weapons and bombings, and claimed that the state government’s powers have been effectively nullified, comparing the situation to an informal enforcement of Article 355. He questioned why the central government has not taken more decisive action to end the violence. **Related:** [Manipur on Edge: Violent Clashes Erupt on the day following Kuki-Zo Protests Demanding Separate Administration, action against state CM based on leaked tapes](https://sabrangindia.in/manipur-on-edge-violent-clashes-erupt-on-the-day-following-kuki-zo-protests-demanding-separate-administration-action-against-state-cm-based-on-leaked-tapes/) [Anguish of Manipur reverberates in Lok Sabha as Congress Manipur MP speaks against PM Modi’s “silence”](https://sabrangindia.in/anguish-of-manipur-reverberates-in-lok-sabha-as-congress-manipur-mp-speaks-against-pm-modis-silence/) [Supreme Court comes down heavily on Manipur government for failing to take undertrial to Court owing to his ethnic Kuki identity](https://sabrangindia.in/supreme-court-comes-down-heavily-on-manipur-government-for-failing-to-take-undertrial-to-court-owing-to-his-ethnic-kuki-identity/) [Manipur: Violence surges as do displacements, CM Biren Singh finally admits that Centre & State are not meeting public expectations](https://sabrangindia.in/manipur-fresh-bouts-of-violence-more-displacements-loss-of-property-curfew-attack-on-cms-advance-convoy-failure-to-bring-peace-continues/) #### Trending ### [CIS Report: Aadhaar Data of 130 Millions, Bank Account Details Leaked from Govt Websites](https://sabrangindia.in/cis-report-aadhaar-data-130-millions-bank-account-details-leaked-govt-websites/) [Dalit Bahujan Adivasi](https://sabrangindia.in/category/hate-harmony/dalit-bahujan-adivasi/) May 3, 2017 ### [Nearly 9,000 people participate in signature campaign to demand justice for Bilkis Bano](https://sabrangindia.in/nearly-9000-people-participate-signature-campaign-demand-justice-bilkis-bano/) [Communalism](https://sabrangindia.in/category/hate-harmony/communalism/) September 7, 2022 ### [Fact Check: The RSS Had No Role in India’s Freedom Struggle](https://sabrangindia.in/fact-check-rss-had-no-role-indias-freedom-struggle-0/) [Communal Organisations](https://sabrangindia.in/category/communal-organisations/) July 10, 2019 ### [‘Reforms’: Sachar Committee, the 2013 Amendments and the motive behind the proposed changes in the Waqf Regime](https://sabrangindia.in/reforms-sachar-committee-the-2013-amendments-and-the-motive-behind-the-proposed-changes-in-the-waqf-regime/) [Minorities](https://sabrangindia.in/category/minorities/) May 8, 2025 ##

Google said on Wednesday that China-linked hackers were breaking into a range of companies to steal sensitive national-security and economic data. Kevin Frayer via Getty Images Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have [feedback](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/contact/). WASHINGTON — Highly sophisticated hackers linked to the Chinese government are breaking into technology companies, software-as-a-service providers and legal-services firms with stealthy malware that has allowed them to quietly steal sensitive data from those companies and their customers, [Google announced on Wednesday](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/brickstorm-espionage-campaign). The hackers have pivoted from service providers to their customers’ networks, searched the emails of specific people inside legal firms and hunted for information about U.S. national security and international trade matters, according to Google. The threat actors have also stolen the source code for widely used enterprise technologies, likely as part of an effort to analyze them for undisclosed vulnerabilities that could power future attacks, Google said. In some breaches of enterprise tech vendors, they have searched the email inboxes of software developers for information about product flaws. [A China-linked group called UNC5221](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ivanti-zero-day-attacks/736932/) is conducting most of the attacks, according to Google, but because different teams often share tools, the tech giant said other China-linked groups are also likely involved. The campaign is active right now, Google cybersecurity experts told reporters on Tuesday during a briefing at the company’s Cyber Defense Summit in Washington. “This is happening in the United States, this is next-level activity, and we're only going to learn more about it over time,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). Hultquist described the campaign as “a very good intelligence operation” and said the attackers’ movement from major vendors to their customers recalled other supply-chain incidents such as [Russia’s SolarWinds espionage campaign](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/solarwinds-1-year-later-cyber-attack-orion/610990/). “It is them moving upstream where they can pick and choose their targets of interest.” ### **Hiding in the gaps** An alarming element of the campaign, Google said, is the hackers’ use of [a malware backdoor called Brickstorm](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-post-exploitation-lateral-movement) that they plant on systems that cannot run endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus software, such as VMware ESXi hypervisors, email security gateways and vulnerability scanners. Evading EDR allows them to hide for far longer than hackers typically can — Google said it has taken victims an average of 393 days to discover the intrusions, a remarkably long “dwell time” that defies recent trends in improved attack detection. Google is releasing a tool that will let companies scan their networks for evidence of Brickstorm, as well as YARA rules that companies can use to search their backups for historical evidence of intrusions. Google experts said the hackers excel at erasing their tracks. Many organizations will “find evidence of historic compromises or active compromises,” said Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer at Google’s Mandiant division. Companies that do see signs of the Brickstorm malware need to conduct a thorough investigation, he added. “This is a very, very advanced adversary.” ### **Patient adversary, long-term ripple effects** The main China-linked group responsible for the intrusions, UNC5221, “is the most prevalent adversary in the United States over the past several years” in terms of the frequency, severity and complexity of their attacks, Carmakal told reporters. UNC5221 hackers are extremely stealthy, Carmakal said, never using infrastructure hosted on the same IP address in more than one attack to avoid creating a recognizable pattern. “It’s very hard to detect them and to investigate them,” he said. The attackers are also patient. In one investigation, Google saw the hackers configure their backdoor to lie dormant for months while the victim investigated signs of an intrusion. “It’s clever, but it also shows they’re in it for the long game,” said Austin Larsen, a principal threat analyst at GTIG. Because most companies haven’t discovered the intrusions until long after their logs from the initial access timeframe are automatically deleted, Google researchers have found it difficult to identify the hackers’ means of initial access. But the company said evidence points to the attackers “compromising perimeter and remote access infrastructure,” including Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs and several other edge devices. UNC5221 has been one of the primary groups [exploiting](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ivanti-zero-day-attacks/736932/) Ivanti [vulnerabilities](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-exploiting-critical-ivanti-vulnerability?e=48754805) over the past two years. Google experts declined to identify any of the victims, including the companies that have been hacked because of supplier breaches, as many of those victims are still remediating the intrusions. The company said it was publicizing the ongoing campaign now because it wanted to learn more about the extent of the attacks and to warn potential victims. The impact of the campaign will continue to resonate “six- to twelve- to eighteen- to twenty-four months from now,” Carmakal said, “because over that time, there will be new things that will come out \\[and\\] there will be new victims that disclose \\[breaches\\].” - [purchase licensing rights](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl=https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/china-espionage-supply-chain-cyberattack-backdoor-malware/760917/) Filed Under:[Breaches,](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/breaches/)[Cyberattacks,](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/cyberattacks/)[Threats](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/threats/) ### Cybersecurity Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Email: - Select user consent:By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.informatechtarget.com/terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.informatechtarget.com/privacy-policy/).

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement.

Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community.

Wikimedia Commons A map of the India- China border in Ladakh, depicting the 1956 and 1960 claim lines of China, as well as lines of actual control before and after the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Wikimedia Commons [Sushant Singh](https://caravanmagazine.in/author/sushant-singh) 30 September, 2022 **FOR THE FIRST TIME** in forty-five years, on 15 June 2020, India and China recorded the death of Indian soldiers on the Line of Actual Control—the contested border between the two countries, which stretches from the Karakoram Pass in the west to Myanmar in the east. The deaths occurred in the Galwan Valley, in Ladakh, and these were the first military casualties in the territory since the 1962 Sino-India War. The full details of the incident are shrouded in ambiguity, but it involved Chinese soldiers pitching tents around the Galwan Valley and their forceful eviction by the Indian Army—there is little clarity on whether China’s People’s Liberation Army had agreed to abandon these positions. This led to a clash which claimed the lives of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four PLA soldiers. More than seventy Indian soldiers were injured while nearly a hundred more, including some officers, were taken captive by the Chinese. No Chinese soldier was in Indian captivity. “We were taken by surprise by how well prepared they were for the clash,” a top officer at the army headquarters in Delhi, who was part of the decision-making in the Ladakh crisis, told me. The LAC has neither been delineated on the map nor demarcated on the ground by either side. The last attempt to do so failed nearly two decades ago. The difference in the two sides’ understanding of it is so vast that New Delhi claims the border between the two countries is 3,488 kilometres long while China says it is only around two thousand. It is the world’s longest disputed border. As the two countries do not agree on where the “actual control” exercised by either side ends, both are engaged in an uncompromising contest of asserting control over small parcels of land in a desolate Himalayan wasteland. The demonstration of territorial claims can take several forms, including soldiers patrolling up to certain points, building infrastructure along the border and controlling the limits to which people in border villages are allowed to graze their animals. The unforgiving terrain and harsh weather have not dissuaded India and China from deploying around fifty thousand additional soldiers each on the 832-kilometre LAC in Ladakh since the summer of 2020. The deadly Galwan clash occurred at patrolling point PP14—an area that was not until then disputed, and which the Indian Army patrolled regularly. Days after it, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared in Delhi that the Chinese had not “intruded into our border, nor has any post been taken over by them”—an attempt at saving face that China gleefully seized upon as proof that it had not encroached upon Indian territory. The clamour around the deaths and the release of captive Indian soldiers, however, had blown the lid off the government’s attempts to play down the crisis in Ladakh. The situation had already come to public notice in India a month earlier because of massive physical clashes on the north bank of Pangong Lake, also in Ladakh. There were severe injuries on both sides, but no deaths. These major episodes marked the border crisis of the summer of 2020, even though tension had been building for months before that. Two and a half years later, the state of ties between the two neighbours can be aptly described as “No War, No Peace.” This was an expression used by military officers more than two decades ago to describe the situation on the border in the restive Kashmir region between India and Pakistan—the Line of Control. The two situations are materially different, but the terminology makes a connection that was pointed out to me by a senior Indian military commander who was involved in handling the Ladakh crisis. When I asked him about the thinking that impelled military actions leading into the crisis in the summer of 2020, he said, “Do not treat China on the LAC like Pakistan on the LoC.”",

The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

Villages have also faced attacks by [Meitei militias using automatic weapons and mortars](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/violence-continues-in-manipur-mortars-and-automatic-weapons-used/article67253119.ece). Often these incidents have been photographed and filmed, before being shared on social [media](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/10/21/telegraph-misled-readers-on-climate-change-impact-rules-press-watchdog-in-rare-slap-down/) platforms to incite violence and intimidate targeted tribals. This unrest has been intensive and systematic over the last 12 months and by October 2023 more than 70,000 people (including 12,000 children) had been displaced. It has been heightened by [periodic internet bans](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/manipur-violence-internet-services-restored-border-areas-exception-meiteis-kukis-2471548-2023-12-04) and the use of fake news by Meitei media groups, as well as utilising large [protest](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/12/when-peaceful-protesters-face-harsher-sentences-than-violent-racists-something-has-to-give/) mobs to demand the removal of non-Meitei public officials.

Related to these phenomena is the continued religious persecution of the Christian-majority Zo by the Hindu-majority Meitei, which has included [the burning of 357 churches](https://www.opendoors.org.au/frontline-faith/understanding-manipur-what-led-to-the-recent-violence-against-christians-in-india/) since May. Evidence has also surfaced of Zo graves being desecrated. Such claims come despite the existence of regional [Meitei drug gangs](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-violence-poppy-national-security-golden-triangle) and the increased interception by Indian security forces of armed Meitei militia members infiltrating India across the Myanmar border. This discrimination has raised fears that the communal violence aims to force non-Meitei tribals from their land, in order [to monopolise oil, gas and mineral reserves](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/at-the-core-of-manipurs-ethnic-strife-is-fight-over-tribal-land-rights) (such as uranium and platinum). The normalization of violence and population displacement accentuates such a threat. State complicity also plays a role, with Meitei leaders having linkages to big mining corporations eager to exploit such valuable natural commodities. In some areas, power supplies to non-Meitei villages have been sabotaged, leaving them without power or telecommunications for days. Elsewhere, non-Meitei villages have been blockaded by militias, preventing the delivery of essential food and commodities. Signalling a further escalation, in January 2024, [the central Manipur government conceded security control of Imphal to the Arambai Tenggol](https://thediplomat.com/2024/01/abject-surrender-of-the-state-to-armed-militia-in-indias-manipur/). This gave the Meitei militia dominance over security arrangements in Manipur’s capital and – given the militia’s ongoing violence – is an ugly portent for the local non-Meitei population. Meitei legislators were reportedly forced to declare allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol. In the months since the Arambai Tenggol took over, Imphal has seen a rise in armed intimidation, extortion, the illegal occupation of property, and even the [use of improvised explosive devices](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/one-dead-one-injured-blast-indias-manipur-state-2024-02-24/), or IEDs.

Other groups are also recasting the anniversary of the day that Manipur joined the Indian Union on 21 September 1949 as now being a “Black Day” of protest. Additional groups have protested calling for an end to gender-based violence and violence against students. Further collectives are demanding the setting up of an independent Zo administration in Manipur. Coupled with these movements are increasing calls for the Zo areas of Manipur to merge with those in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, especially given the ongoing displacement of the Zo. Within this context, the response by the central government in New Delhi continues to be seen as lax and insufficient. Although the troubles in Manipur are receiving greater national coverage, [Prime Minister Narendra Modi has resisted calls to visit the region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/indian-opposition-walks-out-as-narendra-modi-refuses-to-discuss-manipur-conflict). This comes despite the severe economic and social damage being wrought upon its people, as well as the slow Meitei domination of Manipur’s state bureaucracies. The 2024 [general election](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/08/28/stark-figures-reveal-how-many-londoners-were-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-in-general-election/) may be a factor here, with the BJP seeking to hold the [Inner Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency) (that includes the regional capital Imphal) and possibly gain the [Outer Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency), which it lost to the Naga People’s Front by 73,782 votes in 2019. Moreover, such a blind eye can also potentially be explained by the BJP’s deeper aim to actively assimilate all India’s minorities towards its Hindu majoritarian outlook. Escalating Meitei-instigated violence against Manipur’s tribal groups certainly – and usefully – fits with such a dynamic and appears to be increasingly successful. It also strengthens narratives of India’s Hindu population being threatened by non-Hindus. A BJP victory in the 2024 national [elections](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) will only hasten such a forced “harmonisation”, with negative consequences for other non-Hindu groups, regions, and states across India. * * * ##### Written by [Chris Ogden](https://bylinetimes.com/author/chrisogden/) * * * ##### This article was filed under [Christianity](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/christianity/), [Democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/category/democracy/), [Hinduism](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/hinduism/), [India](https://bylinetimes.com/category/foreign-affairs/india-foreign-affairs/)",

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

This was the Bay of Bengal’s first tropical cyclone of the year and, according to news reports, it was so severe that flood protection embankments washed away, and millions were left without power after the network infrastructure experienced severe damage. As result of the storm’s 135kmph (84mph) winds, Kolkata airport closed, shipping was halted at Chittagong seaport, and schools closed as evacuees moved to over 9,000 cyclone shelters with assistance from India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Cyclones in Indian coastal zones are not a new phenomenon, but they have increased in number and magnitude in recent years [\\[1\\]](https://www.thebci.org/news/the-rising-storm-of-climate-risks-in-india.html#citation1), creating concerns for resilience professionals over escalating climate risks to the country. Vaidyanathan Chandramouli, India’s [BCI Chennai Chapter](https://www.thebci.org/group/india-chennai.html) Leader, said: > _“Climate risk is indeed a significant concern in India. Recent observations have shown irregularities in monsoon patterns, with some regions experiencing reduced rainfall with others facing excessive downpours. This inconsistency is marked by periods of heavy rain followed by abrupt stops, disrupting the usual monsoon cycle. Additionally, there is a noticeable rise in maximum temperatures across the country. Traditionally cooler regions are warming, and winters are becoming more severe”._ He adds: > _“The primary concern posed by climate-related events in our region is the threat to supply chains and loss of premises. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events can disrupt operations, damage infrastructure, and create significant logistical challenges. Additionally, the warming of cooler regions leads to increased use of air conditioning, which contributes to global warming, while the intensification of winters necessitates heating equipment, creating a vicious cycle in the long run.”_ Vaidyanathan reported that business continuity and resilience practitioners in India are exploring how to diversify and decentralise operations to better manage risks and adapt infrastructure to withstand extreme weather. Another avenue is exploring enhanced early warning systems to support timely evacuation and asset protection. However, support from top management is crucial in addressing these concerns effectively, as it is only with adequate support that organizations can implement the necessary measures to build climate resilience and ensure long-term preparedness. This is a change from traditional business continuity management that deals with the effects of disruption in order get back on track with critical activities into a more proactive approach of strategic thinking that modifies organizational structures and adapts infrastructure in advance. However, Vaidyanathan added: > “Currently, there is limited understanding of these concerns, especially in countries like India, where small and medium enterprises (SMEs) significantly contribute to the economy. Their primary focus tends to be business sustainability rather than climate sustainability.” The [BCI Climate Risk Report 2023](https://www.thebci.org/news/new-report-shows-climate-risk-priorities-for-bc-and-resilience-professionals.html) underlines Vaidyanathan’s response. Survey respondents from around the world said that threats related to climate-related events are on the rise. Indeed, 44.4% of respondents stated they had seen a moderate or significant impact from climate related events over the past five years with rainfall and flooding topping the list as their primary climate-related concern. Extreme heat/heatwaves, hurricanes and tornadoes, and wildfires also posed risks, as did the new and rising concern of water scarcity. As a result of increasing climate threats, 47% of respondents highlighted supply chain interruption as their primary concern. Staff absenteeism, loss of premises and power, and revenue dips are also significant potential threats. However, despite these wide-ranging outcomes and the notable rise in events, 22.1% of respondents report their organization has yet to consider climate risk on their risk agenda. To face the rising tide of climate threats, practitioners should seek to align business continuity plans to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) propositions and ensure provision of adequate back-up systems for power and communications. As demonstrated by Cyclone Remal, climate-related events are increasing in ferocity and frequency, and, without any associated legislative regulations to enforce organizational action, ensuring climate risk remains a topic on top management agendas is key to embedding genuine commitment to mitigate climate risk, as well as ensuring a proactive approach is taken. * * * ### Citations \\[1\\][https://climatefactchecks.org/climate-change-leading-to-rise-in-intensity-of-cyclones-along-indias-coastline/](https://climatefactchecks.org/climate-change-leading-to-rise-in-intensity-of-cyclones-along-indias-coastline/) ###### More on -

An [APT](https://apt.etda.or.th/img/Threat_Group_Cards_v2.0.pdf) itself refers to a covert cyberattack in which an individual or a group gains unauthorised access to a network, where it remains undetected for a sustained period. A notable example is the ‘ [Lazarus Group](https://hacken.io/discover/lazarus-group/)’, attributed to the North Korean government, which, between 2021 and 2025, has stolen over USD 5b in cryptocurrency. Whilst APTs are often state-sponsored operations, non-state actors have increasingly relied on these large-scale targeted cyberattacks to achieve [political, economic and military objectives](https://publisherspanel.com/api/files/view/793750.pdf). 2022-2025, as examined in this study, is especially valuable as it coincides with a period of rapid digital expansion and increased geopolitical instability. Indeed, as a means to maintain operational continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic, reliance on digital services, including cloud infrastructure and remote access technologies, surged globally. This accelerated transformation, whilst necessary, also introduced a series of structural vulnerabilities. For instance, according to [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/About/Metrics), the list of known software and hardware vulnerabilities increased by ≈52%, rising by 8,547 cases from 2018 to 2022, spanning over the pre- and post-COVID periods. In the latter period, from 2022 onwards, such vulnerabilities have persisted, if not intensified, as the ‘attack surface’ has broadened and the potential for intrusions increased. This has also been exacerbated by an industry-wide tendency to implement security measures reactively as opposed to proactively. This reality is compounded by heightened geopolitical instability, particularly in light of the Russia-Ukraine (2022-) and Israel-Gaza (2023-) wars, and the deterioration of US-China relations. Such dynamics have increased the appeal of cyber operations as instruments of coercion, disruption and intelligence gathering, creating an environment where APTs serve strategic rather than simply tactical purposes. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly been leveraged in APT attacks, with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT enabling more frequent and sophisticated intrusions. For example, APT groups, namely SweetSpectre, linked to China, have exploited ChatGPT for [reconnaissance, vulnerability exploitation, detection evasion, and post-compromise activity](https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/global-weekly-exec-summary/ai-in-apt-attacks/). More importantly, the accessibility of ChatGPT, described as ‘convenient’ and ‘cost-effective’, has nullified the barriers to entry for malicious actors. Evidencing this, in October 2024, the founders of ChatGPT had announced the disruption of 20 ‘cyber and covert influence operations’ since the beginning of the year. More generally, criminal groups operating in non-Western and non-English speaking spheres can also exploit LLM platforms to produce credible [phishing](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/ai-and-serious-online-crime) messages, a tactic that a recent Google Gemini report has attributed to an Iranian APT group. ## **Data Analysis: Trends and Regional Distribution** _Figure 1: Number of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) between 2022-2025_ The data shows that the number of APTs has risen steadily during this period \\[ _See Figure 1_\\]. In 2022, this figure stood at 424, rising to 504 in 2025, representing an overall increase of 18.9%. Whilst the growth has been generally steady, the period from 2023 to 2024 experienced the largest year-over-year jump, with incidents increasing by 36 (≈8.0%). The regional distribution of APTs in 2025 provides additional insight \\[ _See Figure 2_\\]. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for the majority of incidents, with 54% of the global total. This concentration reflects several structural factors; the region includes the world’s most populous countries, such as China and India, and, particularly the former, possesses advanced digital capabilities that support sophisticated cyber operations. It is also home to numerous geopolitical rivalries, namely those between [India and Pakistan](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/operation-sindoor-and-india-pakistans-escalated-rivalry-cyberspace), or [China and Taiwan](https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/insights/apt-groups#global-threats-china), that often manifest in cyberspace, fostering the development and deployment of APTs. Europe (16.4%) and the Middle East (15.9%) also exhibit notable activity, likely due to the presence of capable threat actors, extensive digital infrastructure, and strategic geopolitical interests and conflicts at present. North America, by contrast, only accounts for 2.6% of recorded activity. This may be explained by the relatively low incentives for Canada and Mexico to conduct APT operations, and, considering that the United States (US) represents the majority of this share, perhaps it is reflective of America’s reliance on alternative cyber operations beyond traditional APT campaigns, including activities that are not publicly visible. Regions such as Central Asia (1%), Africa (0.8%), and South America (0.8%) contribute significantly smaller shares of recorded incidents. These low levels likely reflect a combination of limited digital infrastructure, fewer sophisticated cyber capabilities, and reduced geopolitical incentives for state-sponsored or highly organised threat actors. Notably, 8.7% of incidents are attributed to unknown origins, which may be partly due to the earlier discussed use of AI, as such technologies can obscure the originating state of an attack. Further, a closer look at national contributions within each region highlights the concentration of APT activity among a small set of states. In 2025, China made up ≈84% of Asia-Pacific APTs, Russia ≈81% of Europe APTs, and Iran ≈72% of the Middle East’s APT activity. This disproportionate representation indicates that cyber operations are still dominated by a limited number of highly capable actors, often backed by advanced digital infrastructure and strong geopolitical ambitions both regionally and globally. Considering the data available in 2025, this trajectory of increasing APT activity, as well as the observed regional distribution, is expected to continue. The Asia-Pacific region will likely continue to represent the central focus of such activity, whilst other regions are likely to experience growth as digital adoption expands. APTs should therefore be understood not as isolated or exceptional incidents, but as a structural feature of the global cyber landscape. _Figure 2: APT Distribution by Region in 2025_ ## **Implications** The normalisation of APT operations as instruments of statecraft fundamentally alters international relations by creating persistent, low-level conflict conditions that exist below traditional warfare thresholds. Nation-states increasingly view sustained network presence within adversarial systems as strategic assets comparable to forward military deployments. This dynamic creates a new form of territorial occupation in cyberspace, where APT groups establish persistent footholds that enable intelligence collection, pre-positioned access for future operations, and demonstration of offensive capabilities. The use of sophisticated evasion techniques, potentially aided by AI, also makes attributing APT attacks increasingly difficult, thereby weakening traditional deterrence frameworks that rely on the clear identification of threat actors. The inability to definitively attribute attacks creates opportunities for plausible deniability, enabling state actors to conduct operations whilst maintaining diplomatic flexibility. This erosion of accountability mechanisms further weakens international law enforcement and also creates incentives for escalatory responses based on incomplete information. Moreover, as the frequency of APT attacks continues to increase, individuals and organisations, particularly in highly targeted countries such as the US, may become increasingly sceptical of the security and reliability of digital platforms, especially those underpinning critical infrastructure or holding sensitive data. The erosion of public trust is also exacerbated further by the role of AI, which bolsters the capabilities of malicious actors, lowering the technical barrier for attackers and increasing the frequency of attacks. Nevertheless, AI offers potential avenues for improved [detection and mitigation](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/documents/6061/Toward-the-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-for-Advanced-Persistent-Threat-Detection_.pdf) of APTs, measures which could, if widely adopted, reduce exposure and strengthen public trust in the future. ## **Forecast** - ### **Short-term**(Now - 3 months) - It is likely that APT activity will remain steady, with minor fluctuations in frequency or targeting. - It is likely that existing APT groups will continue integrating AI tools into their current operations, focusing on automating reconnaissance and improving phishing campaign effectiveness. However, significant capability enhancements will remain limited by the learning curve required to effectively weaponise these technologies. - ### **Medium-term**(3-12 months) - It is likely that ongoing geopolitical developments, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, will continue to influence the number and distribution of operations. - It is likely that AI will become more sophisticated, creating new avenues for APTs to increase their capabilities. This includes: automated vulnerability discovery, enhanced social engineering and evasion sophistication. - It is likely that the current regulatory gap surrounding AI use in cyber operations will be exploited by threat actors before comprehensive international frameworks emerge. - ### **Long-term**(>1 year) - It is highly likely that APT groups will increasingly emerge and that there will be a corresponding increase in activity globally. - It is likely that AI will progressively be used as a tool for detecting and preventing APTs. - There is a realistic possibility that regions currently lacking strong digital infrastructure will increasingly rely on APT use in the future. - It is likely that international cooperation mechanisms and frameworks will develop in response to increasing APT threats.

    "full_text": "# Thailand As Thailand’s knowledge and creative economies grow, it’s likely to find itself confronted with an increasing number of incidents of IP theft and cyberattacks. The Thai Government must focus more on proactive risk mitigation to protect its national proprietary assets and security. While Thailand has seen rapid development of its cybersecurity governance in the past few years, including with the establishment of a national cyber agency, little attention has been paid to cyber-related threats to innovation. ASPI assesses Thailand to be Moderately vulnerable to state-sponsored acts of cyber-enabled theft of IP. ### Author Dr. Jessada Burinsuchat [Wat Arun Ratchawararam 005](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/0000140_-_Wat_Arun_Ratchawararam_005.jpg) \\- [Preecha.MJ](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Preecha.MJ) ## Key Facts ### R&D Investments USD $5.8 billion (2019) ### Patent Applications 3,818 (2017) ### Cybersecurity Agency National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) How at risk is Thailand Thailand’s ambitious 20-year development strategy and “Thailand 4.0” vision, focusing on transforming key industries through science, technology, and innovation, place it at risk of cyber-enabled IP theft. The country’s growing digital economy, increasing foreign direct investment in ICT and manufacturing, and government incentives for R&D in strategic sectors make it an attractive target for state-sponsored actors seeking to steal valuable intellectual property and economic information. Since 2018, Thailand has actively pursued a 20-year development strategy to extend its knowledge economy. The strategy, which has been adopted into legislation, [focuses](http://nscr.nesdb.go.th/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/National-Strategy-Eng-Final-25-OCT-2019.pdf.) on developing various types of capital, including human, intellectual, financial, mechanised, social and natural resources. As part of the strategy, Thailand has also [unleashed](https://www.industry.go.th/web-upload/1xff0d34e409a13ef56eea54c52a291126/m_magazine/12668/373/file_download/b29e16008a87c72b354efebef853a428.pdf) a vision of ‘Thailand 4.0’ to transform Thailand into a value-based economy built on science, technology and innovation. Overall, Thailand’s knowledge sector is seeing modest signs of development. Thailand’s patent applications have hovered around 1,400 to 1,900 per year. Patent approval rates have remained low as Thailand faces issues with extensive backlogs and long delays in IP registration. In 2018, WIPO reported that Thailand’s success rate in granting patents was only 14%. Thailand’s foreign and economic policy is driven by pragmatism, as the government seeks to secure economic gains for national development. Thailand also maintains healthy economic and scientific ties with Japan and the US. Both were the biggest investors among OECD countries from 2020 to 2022. Thailand also maintains strong economic ties with China. A part of the relationship focuses on technology investments and technology transfers from China to Thailand. The economic relationship has included strong collaboration in science and technology, and Chinese firms have invested in Thailand’s 5G infrastructure and the broader connectivity ecosystem, including railways. While the two states maintain a bilateral IP agreement, the focus of the agreement is on capacity building. For instance, China has helped to cultivate engineering talent for high-speed railways in Thailand. Overall, Thailand’s relationship with China is quite comprehensive, touching on economics, technology transfers and scientific cooperation. How prepared is Thailand Thailand maintains modest defences to combat the threat of cyber-enabled IP theft. Broadly, cybersecurity in Thailand has struggled to keep pace with economic development and the digital transformation. While there’s better awareness in cyber-dependent sectors, the overall population lacks digital literacy and cybersecurity knowledge, leading to a very high number of cybercrime victims. The banking sector, in particular, has established cybersecurity measures, and government and businesses have invested more in awareness building. The National Cyber Security Agency (established in 2011), Office of the Personal Data Protection Committee, and the Royal Thai Police play significant roles in regulating and enforcing cybersecurity and combating cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. The country participates in international agreements and norms related to cybersecurity, seeking bilateral cooperation while balancing relationships with major powers and multilateral cooperation. Thailand hasn’t ratified the Budapest Convention, but it complies with its principles through the Computer Crime Act. Thailand is currently playing an active role in the UN’s Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of ICTs for Criminal Purposes. Overall, Thailand’s posture on international norms on state behaviour in cyberspace has been reactive, though it does comply with most international standards. Thailand has been working to improve IP protection and enforcement to address IP theft. IP governance has almost all the necessary policy frameworks and organisational structures in place. A subcommittee on IP rights enforcement was set up in 2016 to bring 16 government agencies as well as industry groups together to promote IP protection and counter IP violations. In 2017, the Department of Intellectual Property formed a multiagency centre, called Intellectual Property Enforcement, which includes 39 agencies, such as the Internal Security Operations Command, the Royal Thai Police and other public and private agencies to crack down on markets that violate IP laws. Amendments to the Computer Crime Act 2007 in 2017 and additional measures in the Copyright Act now enable internet service providers and commercial service platforms to take down infringing content. There’s a growing culture of IP protection in Thailand, and the country moved up in the US’s Special 301 Report from the Priority Watch List to the Watch List tier in 2017. Efficiency in implementation and enforcement is the biggest stumbling block, in large part due to bureaucratic mechanisms. Altogether, the country’s participation in international IP agreements reflects its commitment to IP protection, but it’s considered a follower rather than a leading actor in the international IP protection agenda. # **Reported cases of economic cyber-espionage** ### Name of Incident ### Victims (entities) ### Sectors Affected ### Affected economies ### Threat Actor ### Alleged state sponsor ### Date reported Operation Cloud Hopper (APT10) Customers or providers of Managed Services / Enterprise Service / Cloud Services, manufacturing companies in India, Japan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service providers worldwide.

The operation has been traced back to at least 2016 and has targeted managed IT service providers, thus acquiring potentially unprecedented access to IP and sensitive data of those MSPs as well as their clients across the globe. Some of these targets compromised include Fujitsu, Tata Consultancy Services, NTT Data, Dimension Data, Computer Sciences Corporation, DXC Technology, Ericsson, and IBM (see Operation Cloud Hopper). A wide range of sectors were affected, ranging from telecommunications to mining. The suspected targets of these operations were those that aligned with China’s national security and “Made in China” goals, focused primarily on valuable military and intelligence information as well as confidential business data. PwC, in cooperation with BAE Systems and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, attributed the attacks to APT10, a China-based hacking group. Symantec, similarly, found an advanced persistent threat campaign targeting companies in multiple sectors across 17 regions in Japan. This campaign was also attributed to Cloud Hopper (which they called Cicada).Several countries, including the US and Australia, attributed Operation Cloud Hopper to a hacking group that has backing from the Chinese state. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Intellectual property, possibly worth billons of dollars ### Attribution [PwC](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html), [Symantec](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage), Governments of US, UK, New Zealand, and Australia ### Governments' response The U.S. Government held the Chinese government accountable for these campaigns, including [indicting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion) suspected hackers.

Bitdefender attributed the attack to Emmisary Panda, a China-based threat group active since 2010. The group has been suspected of conducting [espionage](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/mustang-panda) operations on civil society organisations and governments deemed critical of the PRC, including advocacy organisations on Taiwan and Tibetan independence. While this threat group’s focus has traditionally been on political espionage, we suspect – with moderate confidence¬ – that this attack had possible economic objectives as well. Initiated in July 2017, this cyber incident came against the backdrop of developments in China’s technology and telecommunications sector, including Beijing [laying out](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/china-artificial-intelligence.html) a development plan to become the world leader in AI by 2030. The Iron Tiger APT (aka Panda Emissary or TG-3390) is active at least since 2010 and targeted organization in APAC, but since 2013 it is attacking high-technology targets in the US. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Unknown ### Attribution [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/185/Bitdefender-Business-2017-WhitePaper-PZCHAO-crea2452-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf) ### Governments' response None ### Sources ### Level of confidence **Moderate Confidence** **(7 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - No clear information if commercial data is targeted (1 point) - APT actor has some history of stealing IP and other commercially valuable data (2 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, USA and Vietnam Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) 2017 ### Context In 2017, FireEye announced that they have observed APT32 conducting cyberespionage operations targeting foreign companies with a vested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors.

These campaigns were conducted in three clusters. First, from January to March 2020, there was a broad campaign against 75 private entities in 20 countries, with a focus on industries ranging from petrochemicals to defense industrial base. Mandiant notes that while it’s unclear if APT41 scanned the Internet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, the victims appear to be more targeted in nature. The economies affected were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA. Second, in September 2020, hackers associated with APT41 were [charged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with computer intrusion campaigns against more than 100 victims globally, including in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The entities affected were those that specialize in software development, manufacturers, telecommunications, non-profit, universities, and civil society organizations. Third, from July 2020 until August 2021 (ongoing as of then), Trend Micro observed an espionage campaign against victims in India, m, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam in the airline, computer hardware, automotive, infrastructure, publishing, media, and IT industries. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Sensitive business information, source codes, software codes signing certificates, and customer account data ### Attribution US Government, [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits); [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/apt41-resurfaces-as-earth-baku-with-new-cyberespionage-campaign.html) ### Governments' response In second incident, U.S. Department of Justice [indicts](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) seven individuals (two arrested, five remaining) ### Sources ### Level of confidence **High Confidence (9 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - Commercial data are likely to have been targeted (2 points) - APT actor is strongly associated with economic espionage operations, with motivations strongly tied to certain states’ industrial policy objectives (3 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) ### Office 40 Macquarie StreetBarton ACT 2600 ### Contact Ph: +61 2 6270 5100 [E: enquiries@aspi.org.au](mailto:hello@aspi.com) ### Explore [Home](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au) [About](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/about) [Country Profiles](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/country-profiles) [Insights](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/insight) [Media](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/media) [Case Repository](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/case-repository) © 2025 ASPI.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

These include political rallies, electoral campaign events, religious processions, protest marches, demonstrations, and cultural or nationalist gatherings. In other instances, they are organized with the express objective of harassing minorities. In 2024, the Indian general election, state elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, and hate rallies triggered by exaggerated claims of violence against Hindus in Bangladesh served as key catalysts for a significant proportion of hate speech incidents. Hate speech in India in 2024 followed an alarming trajectory, deeply intertwined with the ideological ambitions of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the broader Hindu nationalist movement. The number of hate speech incidents targeting religious minorities surged from 668 in 2023 to 1,165 in 2024, marking a staggering 74.4% increase. Dangerous speech—defined as speech that \"increases the risk that its audience will condone or participate in violence against members of another group\"—also saw a significant rise. Patterns of hate speech in 2024 reflect both continuity and transformation in its context and content with longstanding Hindu nationalist tropes remaining dominant—such as the portrayal of Muslims and Christians as “outsiders” in Hindu India and Muslims as a threat to Hindus. Hate speeches frequently invoked the narrative of Muslims as \"infiltrators,\" linked to thinly veiled allegations of all Indian Muslims as Bangladeshi migrants or Rohingya refugees. Hindu far-right leaders demonized Indian Muslims as parasitic and thieving, alleging that they were either wrongfully granted resources that rightfully belonged to Hindus or were stealing Hindu wealth through acts of aggression. These rhetorical shifts reinforced exclusionary narratives, further escalating anti-minority sentiment and hostility. Social media platforms—Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter)—have been key instruments in enabling, amplifying, and mainstreaming hate speech and extremist ideologies, both in India and globally. In the Indian context, these platforms have been extensively utilized to articulate and spread Hindu nationalist ideology and anti-minority rhetoric. Of the 1,165 in-person hate speech events targeting Muslim and Christian minorities in 2024, 995 videos were traced back to their original sources on social media, where they were first uploaded or live streamed. Given the logic of virality, social media platforms facilitate the rapid and widespread circulation of hateful content while also elevating the most extreme instances of hate speech through algorithmic amplification. Despite their own community standards prohibiting hate speech, social media platforms failed to enforce their guidelines, allowing violative content to spread unchecked. Viewed cumulatively, shifts in hate speech patterns in 2024 reinforced and amplified the core tenets of the Hindu nationalist worldview, that is, the idea of India as an exclusively Hindu nation with minorities, especially Muslims and Christians, as perpetual outsiders. The sharp spike in the rise of hate speech events points to the incorporation of hate speech as part of routine electoral politics and campaign strategy. It is also indicative of an increasingly aggressive assertion of Hindu nationalism in public and political life. As of 2024, Hindu nationalism has taken on a much more extreme form, with its rhetoric becoming more blatant, inflammatory, and violent. Marking a continuity with past trends, hate speech in 2024 contributed to an environment where increasingly egregious expressions of hate and violence against Indian minorities continued to be normalized. **Keywords:** India, Hate Speech, Hindu nationalism, India Hate Lab, Center for the Study of Organized Hate, Narendra Modi, T Raja Singh, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Indian Muslims, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party, Nitesh Rane **Suggested Citation:** [Suggested Citation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5130832) Lab, India Hate, **Report 2024: Hate Speech Events in India** (February 10, 2025).

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

In October, the South China Morning Post reported that China had revived plans to build a 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) tunnel to divert water to Xinjiang province from the Yarlung Tsangpo River in southern Tibet and was testing the technique on a separate tunnel project. China denied that any such plans were underway. But when the Sang River then appeared muddier than normal in recent weeks and displayed elevated levels of iron, it struck a nerve in India. A local leader running for office in Arunachal Pradesh speculated that Chinese construction was responsible for the pollution, but he failed to provide evidence to back up his assertion and both Indian and Chinese leaders denied that China was responsible for the muddy waters.

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19.

Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background.

Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies.

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(BIJU BORO/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _Despite the size and importance of the massive interconnected river system China and India share (along with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh), no integrated structure exists for its management, and the bilateral agreements that govern it are far from sufficient._ - _Political disputes, such as the 2017 standoff over the Doklam Plateau, could harm the waterways China and India share._ - _Unless the countries agree to institute a basinwide mechanism for water management, the river systems they both depend on will be at risk._ Nearly a year after their standoff on the Doklam Plateau began, India and China are trying to get their relationship back on track. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last month in Wuhan with just that goal in mind, and though their summit was more spectacle than substance, it was nonetheless a necessary step toward resolution. The informal meeting gave the two leaders a prime opportunity to lay aside, however briefly, their countries' long-standing differences and focus on topics of mutual concern, such as climate change, food security and natural disasters. Yet one related issue was missing from the agenda: water. If Beijing and New Delhi fail to address the matter, the repercussions for the region, its inhabitants and its environment will likely be devastating....

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "title": "India’s trade faces tariff shock | State Street",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Under the new Trump administration, the US imposed tariffs of 10% to 50% on imports from over 80 countries. India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B) 1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems &amp; jewelry, dairy &amp; agriculture, machinery &amp; engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems &amp; jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42% 2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18% 3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion 4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21% 5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP 6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

On May 26-27, Malaysia, as the 2025 ASEAN chair, hosted a series of summits that underscored ASEAN's broad dual-track initiatives to bolster intra-bloc trade and trade diversification. The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices.
