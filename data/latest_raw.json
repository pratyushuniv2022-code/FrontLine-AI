    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "[Skip to the content](https://nuclearnetwork.csis.org/nuclearnetwork.csis.org#site-content) The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)’s [_Military and Security Developments involving the People’s Republic of China 2022_](https://navyleaguehonolulu.org/maritime-security/ewExternalFiles/2022-military-and-security-developments-involving-the-peoples-republic-of-china.pdf) states that China is expected to expand its nuclear stockpile to 1,500 warheads by 2035 based on current modernization efforts. The [2023 iteration of the report](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF) estimates that China will have 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030 and is currently on track to exceed previous projections. Concern about China’s growing nuclear capability has led to questions surrounding what the 2035 nuclear landscape will look like if current projections come to fruition. China’s efforts to expand its nuclear stockpile also affect South Asia, a region with three countries that possess nuclear weapons and a long history of border disputes that shapes escalation dynamics and crisis management. The impact of China’s nuclear expansion in the region is overlooked in policy discussions in the West. This article aims to fill a critical analytical gap regarding the impact of China’s expected nuclear buildup by laying out the current South Asia nuclear landscape. The trilateral nature of nuclear deterrence in this region is a potent reminder of why Western policymakers need to pay attention to the China-India-Pakistan nuclear trilemma and landscape. ### **Nuclear Trilemma** The nuclear trilemma in South Asia has various relationship dynamics. These include India’s historically contentious relations with China and Pakistan amid military cooperation between the two countries. The [drivers of the South Asia trilemma](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25751654.2022.2158700) include reasons such as “asymmetry in capabilities, changing security alignments and emerging strategic rivalries.” There are layers of complexities that contribute to the current state of the trilemma. One includes nuclear postures and threat perception. China and India both follow an [assured nuclear retaliation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq00j) posture with a survivable second-strike force. China’s nuclear deterrent aims to be dependable, survivable, and one that can penetrate an adversary’s defenses following a nuclear attack. India’s [doctrine](https://archive.pib.gov.in/archive/releases98/lyr2003/rjan2003/04012003/r040120033.html#:~:text=A%20posture%20of%20%22No%20First,designed%20to%20inflict%20unacceptable%20damage) aims to deter a nuclear attack by having retaliatory capability against a potential strike from both Pakistan and China. Pakistan maintains ambiguity over its nuclear policy and follows an [asymmetric escalation posture](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq00j), which includes threatening the first use of nuclear weapons in a conventional crisis. Statements [from military officials](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq00j) clarify Pakistan’s nuclear policy, placing India at the center of its threat environment. [In a public speech](https://issi.org.pk/speech-by-lt-gen-retd-khalid-kidwai-advisor-national-command-authority-and-former-dg-spd-on-25th-youme-e-takbeer/), Lt. General Khalid Kidwai, adviser to the Pakistan Nuclear Command Authority, mentioned full-spectrum capability, a policy aimed at keeping India’s “aggressive designs, including the Indian military’s Cold Start Doctrine, in check.” Another layer of complexity arises from [no first use (NFU) policies](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/11/06/united-states-china-nuclear-meeting-no-first-use-arms-control/), pledges not to use nuclear weapons first in the event of an attack. India and China are the only two countries to pledge such a policy globally. Concerns have recently arisen over their NFU commitments. Indian strategists and experts [raised concerns](https://thediplomat.com/2019/08/if-india-rethinks-nuclear-no-first-use-it-wont-surprise-pakistan-or-china/) over China’s NFU. In a [recent study](https://www.sipri.org/commentary/blog/2020/indias-no-first-use-dilemma-strategic-consistency-or-ambiguity-towards-china-and-pakistan) by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Indian experts expressed concern regarding whether China would abide by its NFU policy if it were attacked by conventional weapons in Arunachal Pradesh. These concerns include entanglement of nuclear and conventional platforms and India’s lack of engagement with China, raising questions on the credibility of the policy. Recent statements by India have also raised questions regarding its NFU, with Indian defense minister Rajanth Singh commenting during a tour of the Pokhran test site in 2019 that “ [future \\[NFU\\] policy will depend on the situation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear/india-says-committed-to-no-first-use-of-nuclear-weapons-for-now-idUSKCN1V613F/).” Pakistan called the statement “ [shocking and irresponsible](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-thirst-for-violence-pakistans-reaction-to-rajnaths-no-first-use-nuclear-policy-statement/336482),” while China did not issue a response. While there is no indication that China and India have sought a policy reversal, it prompts questions on how future circumstances shape this policy. Conventional military forces also shape deterrence in the region. Given Pakistan’s [weak conventional forces](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/202207-Tellis_Striking_Asymmetries-final.pdf) in comparison to India, Pakistan cannot forgo the option of first nuclear use. India faces a [similar problem](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/americas-bad-bet-india-modi) regarding conventional military power vis-à-vis China. Moreover, growing [military cooperation](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-seeks-new-fields-cooperation-with-pakistan-military-2023-05-08/) between Pakistan and China proves consequential for India’s conventional forces. This cooperation dates back to the development of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program, with [declassified intelligence](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB114/index.htm) revealing Chinese-language material in nuclear weapons designs that Pakistan provided to Libya. The documents claimed that China and Pakistan’s adversarial relationship toward India led to the development of a close military cooperation between the two, causing the current security alignment in the region. Current [DOD estimates](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF) reveal that China is considering developing People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military logistics facilities in Pakistan. There are concerns from India regarding China’s “ [political support and flow of technology](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25751654.2022.2134726)” to Pakistan. This security alignment, with India on one end, and China and Pakistan on the other, has led to the trilateral nature of deterrence in the region. This influences the nuclear escalation dynamics in the context of ongoing border disputes. ### **Escalation Dynamics** Nuclear escalation dynamics in South Asia involve the entanglement of border disputes, nuclear signaling, and rhetoric. These border disputes come from conflicts in disputed territories along the India-China and India-Pakistan borders. Escalation dynamics in the region primarily involve conventional options but escalate to subsequent nuclear signaling and rhetoric. While this intention is not formally declared, border disputes create an opportunity to adopt these nuclear signaling and rhetorical responses. Table 1 highlights border disputes as well as the timelines of subsequent nuclear signaling and rhetoric. The borders along which disputes have taken place are the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China and the Line of Control (LoC) between India and Pakistan. | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Event | Timeline | States | Nuclear Signaling and Rhetoric | | **Line of Actual Control** | | **Tawang Border Issue** | 12/9/2022 | China, India | On December 15, 2022, India [test-fired the Agni-5](https://apnews.com/article/politics-china-fires-india-government-a4dcdfa4415262304074a5aa58e2fc4d) nuclear-capable ballistic missile to strengthen its deterrence against China. | | **Galwan Valley Standoff** | 6/15/2020 | China, India | On February 19, 2021, [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1RU4y1W7EU/) emerged of People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force soldiers [pledging allegiance to Chinese sovereignty](https://www.stimson.org/2023/analyzing-chinese-nuclear-signaling-towards-india-in-2021/), with visuals of nuclear-capable DF missiles.On March 26, 2021, China conducted a [preparedness exercise](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-missile-a-warning-to-rivals-abroadand-at-home-1501409739) for the DF-31AG and prepared the missile for testing for [regional deterrence](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-03/nuclear-notebook-chinese-nuclear-weapons-2023/). | | **Line of Control** | | **Pulwama and Balakot Crisis** | 2/14/2019; 2/26/2019 | India, Pakistan | At a campaign rally on April 21, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that if an Indian pilot had not been freed, India would have unleashed a “ [night of murder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxZGbwCcCd0)” He also confirmed that India had a package of [missile strikes](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1QZ0F0/) in response. | | **Uri Attack** | 9/18/2016; 9/28/2016 | India, Pakistan | On January 19, 2017, Pakistan threatened that it would use nuclear weapons and take necessary measures to defend itself, “ [should India invade](https://www.ft.com/content/889ebb80-dc9b-11e6-9d7c-be108f1c1dce).” | **Table 1: Border Disputes and Nuclear Signaling in South Asia** In this context, disputes occur along two border lines. The first is along the LAC, a 2,100-mile border between India and China. The Tawang border dispute was the latest incident, when India accused Chinese troops of encroaching on Indian territory. While resolved immediately via diplomatic channels, India conducted a [test-fire](https://apnews.com/article/politics-china-fires-india-government-a4dcdfa4415262304074a5aa58e2fc4d) of its Agni-5 ballistic missile in a show of deterrence against China, though the move elicited no response from China. The Tawang border issue followed the Galwan Valley standoff, the deadliest border clash between India and China since the Sino-Indian War in 1962. The clash occurred along the LAC, when India suspected China of setting up camp in a mutually agreed [buffer zone](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/galwan-valley-clash-timeline-india-china-disengagement-7358554/), resulting in casualties on both sides. China released a video of People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) soldiers pledging allegiance to the DF intercontinental ballistic missile, followed by a preparedness exercise. There was [no Indian response](https://www.stimson.org/2023/analyzing-chinese-nuclear-signaling-towards-india-in-2021/) to the exercise. The second area of dispute is along the LoC **,** a 450-mile border between India and Pakistan that is not legally recognized. The two case studies detailed here involve Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a Pakistan-based militant group. The [Pulwama attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47302467) was a suicide attack by a JeM assailant that killed 40 Indian soldiers, leading to a retaliatory strike by India at a JeM site in Balakot, followed by Pakistan [retaliatory strikes](https://warontherocks.com/2019/10/climbing-the-escalation-ladder-india-and-the-balakot-crisis/) in India-administered Kashmir. An Indian air force pilot was taken captive by Pakistan and released days later as a “ [gesture of peace](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wing-commander-abhinandan-varthaman-iaf-pilot-was-released-as-a-gesture-of-peace-says-pakistan/article61712571.ece),” putting an end to the conflict. After the incident, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi used the term “ [night of terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxZGbwCcCd0)” in a campaign rally and later confirmed that India prepared for missile strikes if the pilot was not returned, a move which Pakistan [denounced](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1956656/pakistan-flays-modis-irresponsible-war-rhetoric). The attack on the Indian army camp in Uri led to India responding with [surgical strikes](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N20A2DI/#:~:text=The%20last%20major%20attack%20in,in%20Pakistan%20Kashmir%20weeks%20later.) on suspected militant camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. During the following tensions, Pakistan threatened to use nuclear weapons if [India invaded](https://www.ft.com/content/889ebb80-dc9b-11e6-9d7c-be108f1c1dce). There was no formal response from India. China adopts the [policy of neutrality](https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/sa/sa_99sis04.html) over the Kashmir issue, though India views the policy as more “pro-Pakistan,” due to earlier years of conflict on either side of the border, with China and Pakistan forging a friendship due to their problems with India. However, China continues to defend its policy of neutrality despite its military closeness with Pakistan. It is believed that China’s pro-Pakistan policy during the Kargil War [pivoted](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1450/RAND_MR1450.pdf) after Pakistan’s nuclear test, carried out [against the advice of China](https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/sa/sa_99sis04.html). Based on the two case studies along the LAC, it is evident that the border disputes, and subsequent escalatory behavior, arise from accusations of territorial encroachment. Poorly defined borders also exacerbate the situation, given the difficult terrain along the borders. India and China have not formally responded to each other’s signaling. The LoC case studies highlight the impact of militant groups and the military conflicts that occur in territories despite demarcations, resulting in nuclear rhetoric by both countries. Across both border lines, there is a lack of trust that further exacerbates border disputes and creates an environment for nuclear signaling and rhetoric. ### **Crisis Communication** s As border disputes continue, hotlines serve as a mechanism to ensure communications within the region. There is no public information regarding any ongoing direct nuclear command and control hotlines. While India and China have planned to set up a [high-level military and foreign minister](https://www.usip.org/programs/crisis-communications-china-indo-pacific) hotline, there has been no development from either side. They engage in communications between border personnel and corps commanders. Pakistan and India have maintained [hotlines](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/09/whats-a-nuclear-hotline-good-for-anyway/) between foreign ministers in the region since 2004. Border disputes have impacted communications in the past, often requiring third parties in the de-escalation process. The United States has also played a role in managing crises in the region, such as in the 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan. While the Kargil War was [not nuclear](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-11/conditional-restraint-why-the-india-pakistan-kargil-war-is-not-a-case-of-nuclear-deterrence/), the United States [urged Pakistan](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/nawaz-sharifs-pleas-and-bill-clintons-intervention-in-the-kargil-war/74007/) to conduct a force withdrawal along the border with India. During the war, China maintained its policy of neutrality, calling for Pakistan to resolve the dispute [using peaceful methods](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1450/RAND_MR1450.pdf). While hotlines can help to prevent nuclear escalation in the region, an incident in 2022 highlights problems with crisis communications. India’s accidental firing of a BrahMos supersonic cruise missile into Pakistan sparked questions on nuclear security and crisis communications in the region. The BrahMos is a supersonic cruise missile with a single warhead capability and is not considered part of [India’s nuclear forces](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-07/nuclear-notebook-how-many-nuclear-weapons-does-india-have-in-2022/), though it is nuclear capable. This occurred during a time of relative peace between the countries and caused no civilian casualties. India [stated](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1805148) that a technical malfunction led to the missile’s accidental firing during routine maintenance, acknowledging its error and beginning an internal court of inquiry. However, Pakistan [raised questions](https://mofa.gov.pk/indian-official-acceptance-of-accidental-firing-of-missile/) regarding India’s security protocols as well as the lack of communication over the nuclear hotline with India. It claimed that India did not report the incident to Pakistan, waiting for the latter’s announcement to respond. China continued its neutrality in the situation, calling for both countries to maintain [regional stability](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-says-reviewing-procedures-after-missile-accidentally-fired-into-pakistan-2022-03-15/). Crisis communication in the region works to prevent a nuclear strike, but there is always an underlying concern of a breakdown in communications during a military conflict. The recent accidental missile firing places pressure on communications. There is also a [reputational problem](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/of-friends-and-foes-mark-crescenzi/1127770525) in the region where failures to reach consensus on the disputed territories signal intransigence and, in turn, exacerbate crisis management. The region still has a long way to go when establishing best practices in crisis communications. Moreover, China’s statements regarding peaceful resolve and regional stability highlight its concerns about escalation between the countries, even as it maintains military closeness with Pakistan. ### Conclusion China’s modernization efforts highlight patterns of increased threat perception and modernization in South Asia. India might consider ramping up developments of its capabilities in response to China, and Pakistan will respond to India’s developments. India has already begun [nuclear weapons modernization](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-state-of-nuclear-instability-in-south-asia-india-pakistan-and-china) to deal with the regional threat it faces from China. This will also cause [Pakistan to respond](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-state-of-nuclear-instability-in-south-asia-india-pakistan-and-china), just as it has done in the past with its nuclear weapons program. While Pakistan and China continue to cooperate militarily, it is evident that China has historically tried to stay away from conversations regarding Pakistan’s nuclear signaling. The deep mistrust, accusations of encroachment, and poorly defined borders contribute to escalatory behavior. India’s accidental missile firing raises concerns around crisis communication in the region. The region has avoided misreading nuclear signals, but the threat remains. Efforts to develop the China-India ministerial hotline need to be ramped up by both countries to ensure that communication lines between senior leaders remains open. Indian and Pakistani officials need to engage in a dialogue over the accidental missile firing and identify lapses in the use of hotlines to ensure that these lines of communication stay open to prevent further escalation. De-escalation at lower thresholds could prevent the threat of nuclear signaling in the long term. China’s nuclear expansion by 2035 is decisive in shaping the South Asia region. China does not see India and Pakistan in the same nuclear threat environment as the United States, but its nuclear expansion is causing ripple effects across the region. This needs to be considered not just by China but by the United States, particularly as it forges [stronger defense ties](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3433245/us-india-rapidly-expand-their-military-cooperation/) with India while maintaining its own dynamic with China and Pakistan. This is crucial context as the United States continues its analysis of China’s military buildup through efforts such as the DOD’s annual report on China’s military power. An important takeaway regarding the nuclear landscape is that the trilateral nature of deterrence, now prominent in the U.S.-Russia-China discourse, is not as novel as it seems. The South Asia trilemma provides lessons for the United States to consider as it moves toward its own trilemma. As the U.S. strengthens its military cooperation with India, platforms such as the Quad and 2+2 ministerial dialogues provide policymakers an opportunity to discuss India’s escalation dynamics alongside China and Pakistan’s military responses. This in turn could help the United States develop lessons and best practices for addressing its trilateral concerns with China and Russia. It could also provide the United States an avenue to reconsider hypothetical situations involving the entanglement of military conflicts and nuclear signaling at different thresholds.",

[Articles](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/recent) India’s Prime Minister identifies the Maoist (or “Naxalite”) insurgency as India’s “single biggest internal security challenge.” The insurgency is today severe in scale and violence with 2,212 violent incidents in 2010 causing 1,175 casualties (713 civilian, 285 security force and 171 guerilla), a 63% increase since 2008. [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn1) Today, about 10,000 – 40,000 full-time insurgents wage a protracted peoples war to overthrow the Indian state across a vast “Red Corridor,” affecting 20 of India’s 28 states. India is currently waging a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoists, deploying 70,000 paramilitary police in November 2009, many to the insurgent heartland in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, where 50 percent of all attacks were recorded in 2010. [\\[ii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn2) The Maoists benefit from “two Indias living side by side.” [\\[iii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn3) India is rapidly modernizing, but many inequalities are also widening – between rich and poor, town and country and upper and lower castes. Conditions for large swathes of rural India still compare with the worst of sub-Saharan Africa, and in many remote areas the state has long been absent. However, economic grievances alone do not correlate with Maoism, and in net terms, the Indian state has tremendous internal legitimacy – only 26 of India’s 100 poorest districts, and 20 of its 100 most illiterate are Maoist afflicted. [\\[iv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn4) In truth, Maoist legitimacy is restricted to the extreme end of India’s deprivation scale – amongst the adivasis (tribals) and dalits (“untouchables”) – where in addition to extreme human misery, a broader set of social and status grievances are being inflamed. Analyst Eric Randolph astutely noted on the issue that, “People can put up with a great deal of structural violence in their lives \\[…\\] particularly when it is all they have known. Instead, what tends to trigger acts of violent rebellion are specific flashpoints of injustice.” [\\[v\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn5) For the adivasis and tribals, there are plenty such flashpoints. India’s tribals – in particular the Gonds of Central India [\\[vi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn6) – are under intense assault from state and private corporate interests, and are being pushed off their forestlands by giant hydro, logging and mining projects for little compensation and rehabilitation. The dalits, already the bottom rung of landless agricultural farmers, are similarly disproportionately impacted by the tumultuous changes of modernization on the Indian countryside, and discriminated against daily despite legislation. Tribals make up the core fighting strength of the Maoist insurgency – their narrow eight percent share of the population is still sizeable given India’s 1.2 billion peoples. The Maoist insurgency follows on a long history of peasant and tribal rebellion against predatory state structures on the subcontinent. It originated in its present form in a small village in Naxalbari, West Bengal, where in 1967, villagers armed with bows and arrows resisted police and feudal landlords with bows and arrows. [\\[vii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn7) The incident galvanized the Indian Communist movement, which found a fertile audience for its Chinese-inspired Maoist rhetoric of land reform and overthrow of feudal class structures. Militant Communism has since waxed and waned for the past half century, crushed by security forces and de-legitimized by the Indo-Chinese War of 1962, but the current phase of escalation is the strongest and most violent in history. In 2004, the two largest insurgent groups – the People’s War Group and the Maoist Communist Center – merged to form the new Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI-M). The merger elevated security hardliners in insurgent command, reiterated their commitment to violent and large-scale “peoples war,” and immediately increased insurgent kinetic activity. Today, the CPI-M accounts for 90% of attacks and 95% of fatalities from “left-wing terrorism,” according to the Indian Home Ministry. [\\[viii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn8) Maoist insurgents are tactically effective and intimately familiar with their jungle terrain. They employ classic guerilla tactics, dispersing in the face of organized force and prioritize their links with the population –often through violent intimidation. Their dispersed organizational structure mitigates the risk of being decisively impacted by targeted counterinsurgent (CI) operations. Local cells have tremendous autonomy, reflected in the fact that since 2007, six of the fourteen members of the Politburo, the highest echelon of insurgent command, have been arrested, to little discernible impact in the field. [\\[ix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn9) Unusual in COIN campaigns, Maoist guerillas have the tactical advantage over Indian security forces, and have demonstrated the ability to conduct sophisticated large-scale operations. Insurgents assault training centers and police stations to capture weaponry, attack jails to break out captured comrades and target judges and state functionaries to weaken state presence. Their lethality has grown with the use of IEDs, which now result in the majority of CI casualties. Despite a total lack of external support, the Maoists have ready access to funding – territories under their control are resource-rich and the insurgents maintain an extensive and lucrative extortion network that may net them as much as 14 billion rupees ($300 million) annually. [\\[x\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn10) Part of the insurgent “tax” is explosives used in the mining sector, which companies are often in no position to refuse. [\\[xi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn11) **A Military-Centric Response** India has grown acutely aware of the Maoist threat, but the effort to date remains vastly inadequate, both in mobilizing capacity and in implementing policy. The current counterinsurgent (CI) strategy is typically Indian – manpower-intensive and enemy-centric. It emphasizes building up force numbers to “saturate” areas with government forces and prioritizes kinetic action to suffocate the insurgency by attrition. Only lip service is paid to Western-style population-centric strategy; CI forces are present to target insurgents, not secure the population. The resultant flood of ill-trained and ill-equipped soldiers conducting large-scale sweep and commando operations has exposed civilian populations to collateral damage and abuse, increased Maoist legitimacy and recruitment, and left populations open to reprisal attacks by insurgents. As such, it likely that the scale and intensity of violence will increase in the short-term, but over the longer-term, the sheer mass of government capacity may tip the balance. Even so, brute military force is unlikely to ever fully extinguish an insurgency that is driven primarily, if not exclusively, by social and status grievances. In India’s federalist structure, states assume primary responsibility for combating Maoism, but their inadequacy has forced central “paramilitary” police forces to assume the leading COIN role. “Operation Green Hunt” launched in November 2009 deployed about 70,000 Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) personnel (split roughly evenly between combat and support staff) to reach a 2011 end-strength of 73 battalions across Maoist-affected states. [\\[xii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn12) The CRPF is India’s largest internal security force and is a resource provider of sorts for the central government – sending emergency infusions of armed police to insecure areas across the country. [\\[xiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn13) The nomenclature of “paramilitary” typically attributed to the CRPF may overestimate its true capabilities – it is nowhere close to being a specialized CI force. [\\[xiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn14) In Kashmir, some CRPF units received intensified resourcing and training allowing them to independently secure key terrain districts, [\\[xv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn15) but in net terms, the CRPF is subject to all the problems of the Indian police sector including chronic shortfalls of equipment, training, leadership, and logistical and administrative support. It struggles in basic constabulary operations – let alone open combat against a tactically proficient insurgent on home terrain. Symbolic of the challenge, some CRPF units’ still lack protective vests, even while deployed in frontline combat roles! [\\[xvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn16) For anti-Maoist operations, the CRPF is supported by other state armed police forces, i.e. those state police units trained for higher grade law and order problems, including India Reserve Battalions (IRB). These forces are more competent than the regular police, but there is generally a net decline in combat capacity, discipline and professionalism down the hierarchy of security institutions. Scale, capacity and terrain challenges severely hamper the CI force. 70,000 troops cannot by themselves realistically expect to affect any measurable difference over a population of at least 450 million people across 1.86 million square kilometers of tough, remote terrain [\\[xvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn17) – especially without adequate support from effective civil police for regular law and order functions. The UN recommends a peacetime police-to-population ratio of 222 policemen per 100,000 members of the population, which India – and especially its insurgency-affected areas – falls far short of. [\\[xviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn18) In the Maoist heartland of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, new figures show their police-to-population ratios at 226 and 206 in 2010, [\\[xix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn19) a dramatic improvement (at least on paper) from 2000, when the ratio was a mere 50! [\\[xx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn20) Other states lag far behind. Orissa remains at 136, West Bengal at 100, and Bihar at just 74. [\\[xxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn21) Numbers tell only part of the story. Indian police are notoriously corrupt and brutal by Western standards. Draconian sedition laws punish even the semblance of sympathy for the Maoist cause, [\\[xxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn22) and anti-Maoist operations regularly leave behind a trail of destruction – including serious abuses such as torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and rape. [\\[xxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn23) In the field many units – other than some elite forces – are tactically outmatched. Maoists benefit from the guerilla’s ability to choose the time and place of engagement, allowing them to confront the state at its weakest points. Coordinated attacks have penetrated high-security areas with relative impunity, but most notable was the 2010 Maoist ambush in Dantewada that killed 76 soldiers of the 62nd CRPF Battalion, the single largest loss of life in Indian COIN history. The event deeply undercut the Indian government’s claims of progress, and revealed systemic failures. 62 Bn. had served previously in anti-Naxal operations in Bihar, but like other CRPF units was shifted in an ad hoc manner on the basis of availability rather than suitability for the mission. As a result, it failed to acclimatize to the local physical and human terrain, evident when the force found itself trapped on a narrow jungle path. An IED was able to halt the entire column by disabling the lead vehicle, and well-positioned guerillas prevented any retaliatory maneuver. [\\[xxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn24) Chronic deficiencies in leadership were also evident – not uncommon in a force that sees its best officers poached by other agencies. [\\[xxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn25) The unit commander reportedly lied about his position to avoid a long-range field patrol, and failed to report a lost radio that likely allowed guerillas to track to column over several days. [\\[xxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn26) Insurgent intelligence dominance was easily evident – the Maoists were able to maneuver 1,000 men into place without detection, no doubt benefiting from at least some local support. Dantewada was an exceptional incident, but there are a legion other equipment and training challenges that limit CI abilities. Drastic expansion in force size has come without a commensurate emphasis on building up an adequate support base. Troops are barracked in terrible living conditions and there is widespread resentment at the perceived lack of political support, as well as the lack of clarity and resources with which to conduct their missions. Force protection is low, especially against IEDs. Deployed counter-IED equipment is limited [\\[xxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn27) and current armored vehicles provide inadequate protection, forcing a reliance on vulnerable dismounted patrols. New armored vehicles are being introduced – but Maoists have generally adapted by increasing the size of their bombs. [\\[xxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn28) Unsurprisingly, morale is low. One soldier angrily declared to an embedded reporter, “Have you ever seen a war being fought like this? We don’t know if we are here to assist the state police on law and order or to flush out Naxals, or merely to oscillate between troubled territories, getting our jawans (soldiers) killed for no fault of theirs.” [\\[xxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn29) He went on to point out various shortcomings including inadequate and sporadic rations, virtually no support for injured and killed soldiers, and points out that even “when I go on leave or when I am on my way back home \\[from camp\\], I travel that distance at the mercy of God or the Naxals. What morale are you talking about?” [\\[xxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn30) Despite their tactical capabilities, Maoists adhere to classic guerilla tactics, readily ceding territory in the face of organized state offensives, even “liberated areas” such as Lalgarh district. Their mobility and trans-bordered nature allows them to exploit weak intra-state cooperation, making border areas between states particularly troublesome. Some states such as Chhattisgarh have multiple tri-junctions – where the borders of three states meet – allowing insurgents to mount attacks across state lines before retreating to safe havens. [\\[xxxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn31) Success in one state – such as Andhra Pradesh – may only displace insurgents into others; the neighboring states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh have seen significant spikes in violence since. Several initiatives have been unveiled to overcome the jurisdictional conflicts that plague effective trans-border policing, most notably by creating unified commands in insurgency-affected states. Designed to act as ‘fusion centers’ to facilitate cooperation between states, between state and federal forces, and between civilian and military personnel, their result has so far been underwhelming, not least because of the pushback from many state and local governments. On the local level, a political-criminal interface ensures that many politicians are eager to collude with Maoists and profit from their control of mines and resources. In some states – such as Jharkhand and Bihar – political rivalries mean that states refuse to cooperate with federal efforts, and in others, leaders collude with the Maoists for self-preservation. In West Bengal, the state government has greatly slowed CI activity and all but allowed a Maoist sanctuary earning them greatly reduced levels of violence in the state, but damaging the overall COIN effort. [\\[xxxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn32) The easy availability of central forces has also resulted in many states neglecting their own police modernization efforts. Unsurprisingly, simply augmenting force numbers has not paid dividends. Chhattisgarh and Jharkand both saw insurgent attacks rise despite a police surge, whereas in Andhra Pradesh, the state which has most effectively combated Maoists, the police force in population terms remained constant. Credit for reversing insurgent momentum is generally given to the state’s elite ‘Greyhound’ force built to live and operate in the jungle as the guerilla did, and fight the Indian jungle equivalent of a “bush war.” The force’s 1,000 personnel across 30 “assault units,” benefited from rigorous training and superior equipment (particularly communications technology) and were able to rapidly deploy and effectively operate on Maoist terrain. The Greyhounds have been extremely effective, but they did not operate in a vacuum. Beyond elite forces, Andhra Pradesh pursued an effective state police capacity-building effort, spreading tactically trained personnel across the force, and building synergistic relationships between the district police, intelligence assets and the Greyhounds. [\\[xxxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn33) The state also benefited from focused efforts to improve its COIN doctrine. It coordinated police strategies, created fortified police districts in vulnerable areas, improved intelligence sharing between security agencies, [\\[xxxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn34) cross-trained regular police units with elite police commando forces, and measurably implemented well-crafted community development programs. Unfortunately through the militarized lens of India’s COIN campaign, only the warfighting elements of Andhra Pradesh’s strategy have been replicated with earnest. The CRPF is raising ten Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA) battalions to reach an envisioned end-strength of about 10,000 men. [\\[xxxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn35) COBRA battalions are expected to be some of the best-equipped paramilitary troops in the country, and are trained specifically for the Maoist fight. They are armed like a regular Army infantry platoon and are trained in counter-guerilla and jungle warfare operations at the elite Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS), the Indian Army’s premier unconventional warfare training institution. State police forces – such as the India Reserve (IR) battalions are also are tasked with raising two companies of specialized ‘commando’ forces per battalion [\\[xxxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn36) \\- and more state police forces are being given at least some advanced warfare training. This militarization of the police may yield results in terms of removing insurgents from the field, but comes with the tradeoff in diverting attention and resources away from the equally crucial task of increasing and professionalizing regular policing capacity to “hold” cleared territory. Another worrying trend has been the outsourcing of security responsibilities to auxiliary non-state militias that operate with little oversight, training or accountability, and yet are deputized under the aegis of ‘Special Police Officers’ (SPOs) with official government sanction. Most prominent was the Salwa Judum (literally translated to “Purification Hunt” in the local Gondi dialect), a Chhattisgarh government-sponsored and equipped militia of about 5,000 lightly armed tribal people. Salwa Judum may have benefited from support and funding from mining companies, and was widely accused of extreme human rights abuses including forcible displacements of villages, killings and rape. In response, in July 2011, the Indian Supreme Court declared SPOs illegal and unconstitutional and ordered their disbandment. Indian security officials had routinely justified these forces as helping them ‘localize’ their force presence, build up human intelligence networks and provide alternative employment opportunities for tribal youth. They came, however, with substantial tradeoffs including the militarization of tribal society and the emergence of ‘warlords’ who maintain control over refugee camps and swathes of territory – making disbandment and reintegration difficult. [\\[xxxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn37) However, despite their record, SPOs did provide an important “force multiplier” for culturally foreign CI forces, and their replacement with regular police will take time – by some accounts at least a year. [\\[xxxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn38) Moreover even if SPOs are abandoned fully – itself a dubious prospect – other shadowy vigilante groups also exist, including the several “Cobra” organizations in Andhra Pradesh that retaliate against Maoist violence, particularly if committed against military and government officials. [\\[xxxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn39) As detailed, Indian CI forces suffer many capacity shortfalls that impede their operational effectiveness, but major reforms are currently ongoing that could significantly increase the quality of anti-Maoist CI forces. Israeli assault rifles are being purchased, [\\[xl\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn40) helicopters being redeployed back from peacekeeping missions ostensibly for anti-Maoist operations, [\\[xli\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn41) and retired army soldiers being recruited as trainers. [\\[xlii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn42) Two of three sanctioned UAVs have been inducted to improve ISR capabilities and detect massed insurgent forces – although forested terrain restricts their utility [\\[xliii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn43) \\- and a variety of other new equipment is being inducted. All these if utilized effectively can improve the CI capacity to kill insurgents, but it is less certain that they can strategically end the insurgency. **Inadequate Social, Political and Economic Redress** The Indian state has focused on combating the insurgency by military means, but addressing the legitimate economic and social grievances of tribal peoples has been less forthcoming. Rural development in India comes with significant scale challenges, affecting 1/3rd of the entire world’s poor and traversing remote areas where the government has traditionally been absent. Improving tribal welfare is a component of the broader growth and modernization of India, and as such competes with a host of other priorities. Development projects come with sizeable time-lags that must be factored in – effective policy will require sustained funding and attention over a period of years without immediately apparent results. Development must be recognized for the offensive weapon that it is – both in attacking insurgent legitimacy and in binding tribals to the Indian state by destroying their earlier forms of social existence. [\\[xliv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn44) Moreover, it is not a panacea. Efforts to raise economic and human welfare standards must come alongside broader reforms in social justice and local governance to mitigate predatory and corrupt local administrative structures. It is not for nothing that the insurgent heartland in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand corresponds with the two worst governed states in the country. [\\[xlv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn45) Tighter regulation of private industry is also necessary, including measures to ensure rehabilitation for those displaced by mining projects, and efforts to compensate for and mitigate the ecological and social impacts of extraction. India has admittedly prioritized rural development – elevating its ministry to a cabinet level position in 2011 – and significantly increased allocations to Maoist-affected areas through targeted entitlements. However, rural development to date has been superficial and ineffective, with emphasis on increased allocations obscuring problems in implementation and a lack of progress towards desired outcomes. The Maoist Integrated Action Plan for example provided 250 million rupees in 2010, and 300 million in 2011 in discretionary funds for quick-impact human welfare projects including building facilities for drinking water, sanitation, health clinics, roads etc. Data to date, however, suggests that only a quarter of allocated money has been spent and only 15 percent of projects completed. [\\[xlvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn46) This is despite the obvious fact that sincere development is appreciated – in February 2011 the Maoist abduction of a district collector known for being an efficient and honest administrator led to tribal rallies and protests, forcing his release [\\[xlvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn47) There is, however, a prevalent belief that current patterns of insecurity dictate that stabilization must precede development. This is not an unreasonable view – it is obviously difficult to develop territory you do not control and the Maoists recognize that development can erode their control. As such, insurgents have targeted 1,241 ‘economic targets’ between 2007 and 2011, including roads, power plants, telephone towers etc. [\\[xlviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn48) Such targeting is entirely self-interested, seeking to keep communities isolated and insulated from the relief efforts and ensuring that Maoists are the sole providers of social services. Human Rights Watch for example details how Maoists shut down rural schools to create captive recruiting pools for their Bal Sangam child-brigades. [\\[xlix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn49) Government agents are prime Maoist targets, severely complicating outreach. CI forces have attempted to mitigate this problem by recently unveiling plans for seven new battalions of “specialized forces” that integrate engineering and security personnel. [\\[l\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn50) There are islands of success, but overall reconstruction and aid delivery efforts in Central India leave much to be desired. Plans look good on paper; the Saranda Action Plan for example seeks to build on successful clear operations with a series of entitlement plans – including issuing ration cards for the poor, creating rural work schemes and developing infrastructure to connect isolated communities. [\\[li\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_edn51) Unfortunately, many of these policies fail to be implemented effectively and a large proportion of allocated funds are leaked to inefficiency, corruption and the incompetence of the state machinery. Corruption in particular is not a side effect that can be ignored – the nexus between corrupt politicians, private industry and Maoists is a key driver of both tribal alienation from the state, as well as a major facilitator of insurgent freedom of action. Much development money is also believed to flow to Maoist hands in the form of protection money paid by reconstruction firms. **Lessons Learned** 1) Skewed priority of effort – The mission fails to integrate military and civilian efforts, and prioritizes tactical military decisions that may in many cases have strategic tradeoffs. Development and political outreach is tainted by police brutality, and ineffective military operations are a major driver of Maoist mobilization. Military missions must be designed and conducted carefully to minimize civilian alienation, and must be viewed as precursors for post-“clear” development and reconstruction. Civilian and military coordination must improve and emphasis must be placed on improving the conduct of security forces. 2) Over-Militarization of Police – The emphasis on building up paramilitary forces capable of taking the fight to the Maoists should not detract from efforts to build up competent civil police. Kinetic operations must be merely a prelude to a viable rule of law, which will require building up capacities in not just the civil police, but also the supporting justice and detention sectors. 3) Mobilize Scarce Assets – The Indian Army has rightly assessed that it is not trained or equipped to combat its own people, but it is the only Indian institution with the specialized capacity that could tip the Maoist fight. Aerial assets can improve ISR coverage, equipment such as counter-IED kits and armored vehicles can reduce police casualties, and Army trainers and facilities are the best available resource to build up small-unit combat capabilities and disseminate tactical lessons learnt from other theaters. 4) Improve unity of effort – The insurgency crosses borders, and so must the CI effort. Focus must be given to improving coordination between the many state and central agencies involved, and between states. The goal should be to create effective border management protocols that prevent insurgents from locating safe havens to regroup. 5) Attack insurgent legitimacy – CI actions should best sell their mission, but strategic communications can highlight Maoist complicity in corruption, extortion, and violent abuse at the expense of tribal communities. This is most viable if CI forces themselves adhere to tighter ethical codes of conducts than insurgents – not currently true. 6) Empower non-state actors with care – Actors such as Salwa Judum deeply de-legitimize the state and taint it by association. Especially in India, the population cannot easily distinguish between police branches or between formal and informal forces, and brutalities reinforce the predominant image of the Indian state as callous and predatory. 7) Improve the effectiveness of aid delivery – There must be a focus on outcomes over allocations. Emphasis should be paid on ensuring that projects are completed on time and to standard, and continual oversight should mitigate leakages. Projects should be visible and have immediate impact, and local communities must be involved from project design to completion. 8) Governance reform – Corruption and local predatory state structures are drivers of Maoist legitimacy and mobilization. A major facilitator of the insurgency is the willingness of local politicians to collude with Maoists and/or private industry at the expense of their constituents, and to enact self-interested policies that weaken the mission. Measures such as the sedition laws would be better suited to tackle direct support such as this, rather than human-right workers and ordinary civilians whose only crime is to extend moral support. 9) Aid is insufficient – Aid and quick-impact projects can only alleviate immediate needs. Broader economic and social reforms must be tackled with real urgency. A culture of impunity and blatant corruption must end; for politicians, police, and business elites, and inequalities between rich and poor and town and country must ease. Targeting Maoist-affected areas with increased funding and attention is probably good policy, but it is likely not an overstatement to say anti-Maoist success will correlate significantly with India’s progress in caring for its poorest peoples. * * * [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/counterinsurgency-in-india-the-maoists#_ednref1) “Annual Report 2010-2011,” _Ministry of Home Affairs Republic Of India_, Available at [www.mha.nic.in](http://www.mha.nic.in/); “2010 bloodiest year for India’s Maoist rebellion,” _AFP,_ January 5, 2011.

Latest data compiled by CRPF shows that the number of districts under the grip of Maoist violence has dropped significantly since 2015, with over 90% of attacks being reported from only four states — [Bihar](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/bihar), [Chhattisgarh](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/chhattisgarh), [Jharkhand](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/jharkhand) and Odisha. While 75 districts across nine states reported violent attacks by [Naxals](https://m.timesofindia.com/topic/Naxals) in 2015, the number came down to 67 in 2016 and dropped to 58 in 2017, touted as the best year for the security forces engaged in anti-Maoist operations. Officials attributed the success to the revamped strategy to target senior Maoist leaders and their informers with enhanced and precise intelligence. Officials said there are more joint operations by the CRPF, the IAF, the BSF, the ITBP and state forces. Along with the operations, the administration is speeding up development work, including installation of mobile phone towers and construction of roads, besides setting up police stations in remote villages. CRPF director general Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar told TOI, \"The past year, we have hit the Naxals in their den. Our coordination with state police, intelligence agencies and armed forces has been exceptional. The focus has been on leaders, over ground operatives and sympathisers. The Naxals are not able to move arms, funds and their senior leaders from one place to another.\" He said the influence of Naxals is now restricted to only three pockets — [Bastar-Sukma](https://m.timesofindia.com/topic/Bastar-Sukma) (having an area of around 1200 sq km), AOB (Andhra-Odisha Border — 2,000 sq km) and Abujmaad forest area (4,500 sq km). \"There is a security vacuum and administration has not been able to completely access these areas,\" Bhatnagar said. In terms of operations, with over 150 cadres of CPI (Maoist) killed, 2017 was one of the most successful years for the security forces. The anti-Naxal strategy was revamped after home minister [Rajnath Singh](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajnath-Singh) met CMs of Naxal-affected states in May last year following the killing of 25 CRPF men in Sukma. Singh has said that Naxal violence has come down by 60%. In an internal policy document of Naxals — 'Action Plan 2017-2022' — recovered by agencies recently, Maoists themselves admit that 140 of their comrades, including 30 women, were killed by security forces in 2017. The document, accessed by TOI, says many of its important leaders were also killed by the forces.

Buoyed by the achievement, senior Jharkhand police officers asked the CPI (Maoist) cadres to surrender or meet the similar fate. The special assault group from the Jharkhand’s elite strike force Jharkhand Jaguar (JJ) engaged the CPI (Maoist) squads led by BJSAC member Birbal and area commander Chandan Singh in two encounters within four hours before gunning down the prized naxalite in the second round. Birbal carried a cash reward of Rs 2 lakh on his head. Encounters ensued near the Bheetar Pandra village under the Garu police station in the district when the special assault group was combing forests following intelligence input about the movement of Maoists’ squads in the area. The place of occurrence, more than 30 km from Garu police station, lies in the bordering areas of Latehar and Gumla districts. Palamu range deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Vipul Shukla said, “Birbal’s body was found after the second round of encounter stopped. This is a major achievement of our boys who conducted the operation with precision. He carried a cash award of Rs 2 lakh.” The DIG further said the blood stains at the spot indicated that other Maoists also suffered injuries in the gun battle. A search operation is going on to locate injured ultras. The DIG said, “The Maoists should lay down arms otherwise they will meet similar fate as we are committed to wipe them out.” The subsequent search operation led to the recovery of rifle, live cartridges, detonators, raw materials for assembling IEDs, cash, blankets, medicines, uniforms, jackets and other items of personal use from the spot. Recently, the JJ personnel had also gunned down a commander of a Maoist splinter group near Latehar.

In Odisha, Naxalism picked up rather late, around mid 90s and picked up really fast. When Naidu increased the heat on them, many Naxals moved their base to Odisha and Chattishgarh. I don't know abut Chattisgarh, but in Odisha their modus operandi is pretty similar to underworld. The naxal commanders are absolutely corrupt and make money from extortion. Their favorites are corrupt government officials and local businessmen. The foot soldiers are recruited from local tribes. These folks are really nice people, but can be easily manipulated. The missionaries who operate in these tribal areas are hand in glove with the Naxals and help in recruitment. Due to lack of jobs, little monthly allowance, 3 meals a day and a gun, becomes a lucrative option for many of them. Lately, there was news of infighting among the leaders and one of their top leader, Sabyasachi Panda was arrested. Along with that, improvement in availability of jobs, made the youth to migrate out rather than joining the ranks. In last few years I haven't heard of any measure attack and naxalism is clearly loosing it's steam in Odisha. - ![Like](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) Reactions: [Aravind and Bharath](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/posts/20663/reactions) [![Bharath](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/data/avatars/m/0/52.jpg?1512533665)](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/members/bharath.52/) #### [Bharath](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/members/bharath.52/) ##### Technical Staff Dec 1, 20177911,000[Boston](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/misc/location-info?location=Boston) > [Bali78 said:](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/goto/post?id=20663) > > In last few years I haven't heard of any measure attack and naxalism is clearly loosing it's steam in Odisha. > > Click to expand... similar story from warangal district of telangana - which saw one of the worst naxal attacks in the 90s. - ![Like](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7) Reactions: [Aravind and Bali78](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/posts/20671/reactions) [S](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/members/shashank.125/) #### [Shashank](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/members/shashank.125/) ##### Well-Known member Dec 4, 2017856951[Ban galore](https://www.strategicfront.org/forums/misc/location-info?location=Ban+galore) [Chhattisgarh Encounter: Bodies Flown To Telangana, Identification Underway](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-encounter-bodies-flown-to-telangana-identification-underway-1819139) Chhattisgarh Encounter: Bodies Flown To Telangana, Identification Underway The Greyhounds, an anti-Naxal force, had on Friday swooped on the camp of Maoists near Pujari Kanker in Bijapur district, as a part of a joint operation with the Chhattisgarh Police.

On Sunday, he proved that even bare-handed and with a stab wound in the chest, he could get the better of four [Maoists](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Maoists) at [Jambia Gatta](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jambia-Gatta) in Etapalli taluka in Gadchiroli. Mattami’s heroics, now being lauded across the police department, can fetch him a gallantry award next year as he not only managed to wrest back his [AK-47 rifle](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/AK-47-rifle) and three magazines while blood was oozing out from his chest but also made the red guerrillas flee leaving behind the firearm and 10 live cartridges. In the injured condition too, Mattami did not rest at winning back his AK-47 but kept chasing the fleeing Maoists with a restrained firing in the busy market. The Maoists belonged to an action team that, following their regular practice, had likely targeted a solitary cop to take away his gun and ammunition in a lightning attack. It would be almost impossible to believe seeing a cheerful Mattami at the Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI) that he has just escaped a near certain death. Had a pistol of one of his attackers not developed a snag while being pointed towards Mattami from close range, the story would have been different. An ‘Action team’ of Maoists, comprising four operatives in plain clothes, had surrounded Mattami when he was returning to Jambia Gatta police post after bandobast at the weekly market was called off. While rest of the squad had walked ahead, Mattami stopped to speak to a classmate in the market. Mattami recalled his left hand, that he had put in his pocket, was grabbed from behind. “I was pinned down on the ground before could realize Maoists were attacking me. Four of them had surrounded me,” he said. “One of them pulled out a pistol pointing at me and pulled the trigger. It failed to fire. It was all happening in a flash,” said Mattam, a native of Madska village around 8 kms from the spot of the incident. “At this point, I was trying to free myself while keeping a hold on my weapon and magazines. I knew their intention was to gun me down before fleeing with my weapon. I kicked the man with the gun which fell off his hand,” he said. “Suddenly one of them stabbed me in the chest with a dagger. The pain loosened my grip over my weapon (AK 47) which he managed to snatch and flee. I got up and began to run after them aiming not to allow them to run away with my weapon,” he said. “I pounced upon the one who had my AK and snatched it back after grappling with him. I then fired at them but had to be cautious with so many people around,” he said. Mattami’s vitals are stable as of now.

In these regions, people have seen women with weapon as Naxals, this is for the first time that they will see their own women in security force. This will be a game changer.

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

Even as India and China find themselves **[embroiled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/world/asia/india-china-border.html)** in yet another border standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), **[commentators](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/pakistan-factor-india-china-standoff-161021)** have sounded alarm on how Pakistan could seek to utilize the situation. Concurrently, **[some have observed](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/09/china-india-border-united-states-pakistan/)** that China’s transgression at the border is likely to push New Delhi closer to Washington, at a time when Sino-U.S. tensions are running high. A dyadic understanding of the security environment in Southern Asia, either through an India-Pakistan or India-China lens, is thus incomplete and does not account for the triangular dynamics that shape these interactions. To understand regional dynamics, it is critical to understand the India-Pakistan-China triangle and how it is impacted by the strategic chain, including the United States. The contemporary reality of these dynamics is grounded in an early Cold War history, and potential conflict scenarios involving these countries animate the geopolitics of Southern Asia. **A Triangle Made in History** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is mired in a convoluted history of unresolved border disputes, with military confrontations between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and India and Pakistan at the Line of Control (LoC) occurring intermittently. In 1947, Britain’s hasty withdrawal from the subcontinent as a result of post-war decolonization led to a haphazard redrawing of political boundaries in Southern Asia, leaving some territory contested. The four wars that India and Pakistan have fought since 1947, the Sino-Indian Border War of 1962, and recurrent India-China and India-Pakistan conflicts at the LAC and LoC trace their genesis back to this protracted history. The military dimension of this triangle evolved in the years after the 1962 Sino-Indian Border War, when Beijing and Islamabad signed the **[border delimitation agreement in 1963](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXzxLcF92cEC&pg=PA210&dq=China-Pakistan+border+delimitation+agreement+estranged+democracies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDydvUnNjpAhWCfH0KHQmRDKUQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=China-Pakistan%20border%20delimitation%20agreement%20estranged%20democracies&f=false)**. As part of this agreement, Pakistan handed over the Trans-Karakoram tract, a territory in Kashmir that India claimed, to China, turning the dispute into **[a trilateral one](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357716408444182?journalCode=caji19)**. Further, during the **[1965 India-Pakistan War](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DXY8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false),** Pakistan felt betrayed by a lack of U.S. support, and chose to strengthen relations with China. Pakistan **[had expected](https://www.amazon.com/Wages-Globalism-Lyndon-Johnson-American/dp/0195113772)** the United States to tilt to its side, due to the 1954 U.S.-Pakistan mutual defense agreement and Pakistan’s membership in U.S. engineered alliances like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization. However, during and after the 1962 war, the United States showed hitherto unseen willingness to aid and assist India’s military against Communist China, **[making it prudent](https://www.amazon.in/JFKs-Forgotten-Crisis-Tibet-Sino-Indian/dp/935177788X)** for China and Pakistan to join hands. Although Washington premised arming both Pakistan and India to achieve its Cold War objective to contain communism in Asia, neither side bought Washington’s assurances that its military supplies were not meant to be used against each other. Although China did not provide any direct military help to its new friend Pakistan during the 1965 war, it did engage in a **[psychological assault](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zcylFXH9_z8C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)** against India, repeatedly accusing New Delhi of showing aggression on the India-China border, and threatening Chinese reprisal. During and after the 1971 India-Pakistan War, the United States tilted towards Pakistan, because it needed Islamabad as a conduit to Beijing during the 1972 Sino-U.S. rapprochement talks. Beginning in 1979, Pakistan played a frontline role for the United States in Afghanistan, in the last Cold War tussle between the United States and Soviet Union. In this context, **[geopolitics trumped nonproliferation concerns](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Live-Bomb-Pakistan-1998-2016/dp/0199404569)** as Washington ignored intelligence that China was helping Pakistan develop a nuclear bomb. These conditions were hardly conducive for a healthy Indo-U.S. relationship, despite efforts at finding convergent points during the Reagan presidency. After the Cold War, the subsequent rise of China as a global power, followed by that of India, shifted dynamics of the India-China dyad, leading to heightened Sino-Indian competition, and tightening Sino-Pakistan military ties. Meanwhile, the India-Pakistan relationship remained volatile, taking an even more sinister turn as **[cross-border terrorism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413952?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)** emanating in Pakistan targeted India, becoming a lingering roadblock to normalizing ties. **The Triangle in Contemporary Times** What characterizes this triangle is the geographical proximity of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. Today, both **[capabilities and intentions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2538540?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)** play a significant role in shaping **[perceptions and misperceptions](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Perception_and_Misperception_in_Internat.html?id=qqAIuHgi2hoC&redir_esc=y)** within the India-Pakistan-China triangle. Specifically, Pakistan’s power asymmetry relative to that of India, and India’s power gap vis-à-vis China drive each state’s regional posture. Pakistan’s bid to enhance its capabilities, especially through nuclear deterrence and **[with Chinese assistance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01495933.2013.821850)**, is a means to counter India’s conventional superiority. Meanwhile, China’s growing military capabilities and defense modernization as well as **[its increasing role](https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/growing-chinese-influence-south-asia)** as a development and security partner for not only Pakistan but also a host of other states in India’s neighborhood foment concern in New Delhi. Additionally, what characterizes this triangle is also the **[geographical proximity](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=02XxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=India-China-Pakistan+nuclear+deterrence+and+geographical+proximity&source=bl&ots=Q4wFzhRuUe&sig=ACfU3U2oCZjw3dBhPI8LJeByW_pisUDVmw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwig59mAltjpAhVEgOYKHVz1CO4Q6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=India-China-Pakistan%20nuclear%20deterrence%20and%20geographical%20proximity&f=false)** of the three nuclear-armed countries, wherein any military standoff or confrontation is perceived as having the risk of use of nuclear weapons, or the probability of a two-front war for India, against a Sino-Pakistani combined military assault. However, the Pakistani response to any India-China border confrontation, and a Chinese response to an India-Pakistan war or a military standoff at the borders, is **[more tacit than overt](https://theasiadialogue.com/2017/10/19/the-india-china-pakistan-triangle-strategic-ebbs-and-flows/)**, since the China-Pakistan strategic alliance does not have any unambiguous notion of the two countries coming to each other’s help in the event of a war. **More than a Triangle: The Strategic Chain** Strategic analysts **[increasingly agree](https://carnegieendowment.org/2013/08/05/strategic-triangle-pub-52584)** that the security dynamics of Southern Asia are best explained as a triangle, rather than as an India-Pakistan dyad. However, external players are crucial in shaping outcomes within this triangle, and so regional dynamics may be better depicted as a **[strategic chain](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/acnpi_201703_strategic_chain.pdf)** wherein the United States is the most prominent external agent of influence. The triangle and the strategic chain, as conceptual lenses to understand geopolitics in Southern Asia, are complementary rather than contradictory. While the **[inherent security dilemma](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/acnpi_201703_strategic_chain.pdf)** in the India-Pakistan-China triangle continues to be a major determining factor of the regional security scenario, looking at how the U.S. role complicates responses and counter-responses in this triangle, completes the picture. The emerging security environment in the region can be better explained by considering the concerns regarding China’s rise that drive the Indo-U.S. relationship, China and Pakistan’s threat perceptions vis-à-vis this partnership, and India’s worries emanating from the China-Pakistan alliance. As Chinese influence increases in India’s maritime and continental neighborhood, New Delhi has in turn **[reached out](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/india-act-east-policy-is-becoming-act-indo-pacific/389502/)** to China’s neighbors to build partnerships with countries in Southeast and East Asia. Rising Sino-Indian competition in both continental and maritime realms, along with the global power tussle between China and the United States, has led to a **[greater strategic embrace](https://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/32421/Joint_Statement_Vision_and_Principles_for_IndiaUS_Comprehensive_Global_Strategic_Partnership)** between New Delhi and Washington. Beijing, on the one hand, **[tries to convince](https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-india/)** New Delhi not to fully align with the United States against China, engaging India in a number of forums such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, Russia, South Africa (BRICS), Russia-India-China (RIC), Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and through bilateral top leadership **[summits](https://jamestown.org/program/india-china-relations-from-the-wuhan-spirit-to-the-chennai-connect/).** On the other hand, Beijing solidifies its strategic outreach to Pakistan, which inherently isolates India, through **[controversial projects](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/inclusion-of-cpec-under-obor-shows-lack-of-appreciation-of-india-s-concerns-on-sovereignty-119062601263_1.html)** like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The interlocking threat perceptions and responses in the triangle hence cannot be decoupled from the U.S. strategy in the region, making the strategic chain an effective complement to explain the geopolitics of Southern Asia. **Conflict Scenarios** The regional postures of China, India, and Pakistan and the U.S. strategy in Southern Asia intend to maximize interest by capability enhancement, either through internal or external balancing. This makes the security dilemma in the region more acute and creates the possibility of conflict, some scenarios of which are explored below. _Two-front war_ Since India’s border disputes with China and Pakistan are still unresolved and Beijing and Islamabad have a close strategic and military partnership, India perceives any conflagration with either Pakistan or China as raising the specter of a two-front war. The Indian military establishment is overt in asserting its recognition of and readiness to face such an eventuality. For example, General Bipin Rawat, currently India’s Chief of Defense Staff, while serving as the Indian Army Chief, **[commented](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-front-war-is-a-real-scenario-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/56324336.cms)**, “The two-front is a real scenario. Much has changed from before in terms of our capabilities…The Army, Navy and IAF are now jointly very much prepared for such an eventuality.” India’s military preparedness for a two-front war involves developing its overall deterrent capability and credibility, advances in terms of acquisition and production of military equipment, recalibrating its military strategy, relevant training efforts to meet exigencies, and border infrastructure development. Infrastructure building in the border areas and the issue of terrain advantage has been a [**major source of contention**](https://theprint.in/opinion/china-believes-india-wants-aksai-chin-back-thats-why-it-has-crossed-lac-in-ladakh/430899/), particularly, as seen in the current clashes between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh, or in the earlier Doklam standoff. While the Indian military establishment understandably **[projects its readiness](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-front-war-is-a-real-scenario-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/56324336.cms?from=mdr)**, others **[are more skeptical](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-sobering-arithmetic-of-a-two-front-war/)**. The case of Pakistan taking the opportunity of an India-China conflict and opening a second front at the LoC **[is seen as most probable](https://theprint.in/opinion/india-has-a-bigger-worry-than-lac-china-now-expanding-military-footprint-in-indian-ocean/439934/)**. Other scenarios include China opening a second front at the LAC or in the **[Indian Ocean region](https://theprint.in/opinion/india-has-a-bigger-worry-than-lac-china-now-expanding-military-footprint-in-indian-ocean/439934/)** in the event of an India-Pakistan conflict, or a more sinister case of a pre-planned China-Pakistan military assault against India. Indian Army Chief M M Naravane said earlier this year, “\\[…\\]Though it can take place at any level, Siachen and Shaksgam Valley are the places where territory of these two countries meet. Threat of collusivity is maximum in the strategically important glacier which forces us to keep our possession.” Talking about identifying a primary and secondary front in such a scenario, **[he added](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/01/11/how-will-india-handle-a-two-front-war-army-chief-general-naravane-explains.html)**, “For years, we have been focusing on western border on the basis of threats. Now, we have to rebalance our deployment towards northern sector.” Irrespective of how probable such a scenario is, the perception of such a threat is likely to dictate both the reality and signalling of India’s military preparedness. _Friction in the Strategic Chain_ The India-Pakistan-China triangle is determined by relative national power and mutual threat perceptions, further complicated by the regional implications of the growing confrontation between the United States and China. Pakistan remains the most steadfast ally of China in India’s neighborhood, while India remains the only country in the region that comes closest to competing with growing Chinese influence. Stress in the strategic chain may act as a contributing factor to conflict in the region. The potential for the India-China-Pakistan-United States strategic chain to complicate matters in Southern Asia can be seen in the case of India’s candidacy for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership. **[Washington supports](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/donald-trump-administration-urges-nsg-members-to-support-indias-application/articleshow/59796299.cms?from=mdr)** India’s bid while the **[Chinese oppose it](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-says-no-change-in-its-stand-on-indias-membership-to-nsg/articleshow/61964228.cms?from=mdr)**, citing India’s refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and equating India’s candidature to that of Pakistan. Moreover, Beijing **[has been resistant](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/why-china-changed-its-stand-on-masood-azhar/article27211058.ece)** to supporting international efforts to list Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist at the United Nations Security Council, and **[withdrew](https://www.axios.com/china-backs-terror-designation-for-masood-azhar-in-win-for-india-8af16a49-d93e-4632-a5c2-060f0831ee00.html)** their technical hold only last year. Additionally, Afghan security in the midst of American withdrawal is another issue impacting this strategic chain: China’s **[politico-economic role in Afghanistan](https://warontherocks.com/2020/04/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-afghanistan/)** passes through Pakistan. Islamabad has **[been instrumental in bringing](https://www.ft.com/content/66b0906a-993d-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d)** the Chinese establishment closer to the Taliban, as China hopes to checkmate links between Uighur separatists in Xinjiang Province and militants in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Such developments are significant from New Delhi’s view, as it needs to become **[more pragmatic](https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/does-india-have-a-new-playbook-for-a-new-afghanistan/)** to deal with all forces that are central to the future of Afghanistan. This should include talking to the Taliban, to secure its interest in Afghanistan, in the event of an American withdrawal, the return of the Taliban as a political force and Pakistan’s intention to undercut Indian influence. These frictions in the strategic chain exacerbate the inherent tensions in the India-Pakistan-China triad, making differences more intractable and protracted. **Conclusion** The India-Pakistan-China triangle is determined by relative national power and mutual threat perceptions, further complicated by the regional implications of the growing confrontation between the United States and China. Pakistan remains the most steadfast ally of China in India’s neighborhood, while India remains the only country in the region that comes closest to competing with growing Chinese influence. The power asymmetry between India and Pakistan in the former’s favor, and the **[growing power imbalance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-china-ladakh-lac-border-dispute-c-raja-mohan-6449294/)** between India and China in the latter’s favor will continue to reinforce the inherent security dilemma of the triangle, justifying China-Pakistan collusion, in order to checkmate India’s rise in the region. Moreover, Chinese perceptions of a U.S. containment strategy that involves India additionally impacts the triangle. The broad mistrust and zero-sum perceptions in the triangle will continue to determine the probability of crises and conflict playing out at the LAC and LoC. Besides the more volatile responses and counter-responses over the disputed borders, differences will simmer at global forums over issues such as counterterrorism and nonproliferation, and over the regional security situation in Afghanistan. Despite attempts at diplomatic maneuvers and confidence building measures to arrest uncontrolled escalation and inadvertent conflict in the triangle, the complex dynamics of the India-Pakistan-China triangle, further reinforced by the role of the United States in the region, make conflict a regular phenomenon that has to be managed, rather than eliminated.

[Save](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/user/login?destination=/china/trouble-roof-world) Sign in and save to read later In recent years, the disputed border between China and India has become the site of growing tensions. Chinese encroachment has sparked clashes along the mostly rugged, mountainous border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which threaten to lead to all-out conflict between the two Asian giants. These mounting tensions affect the United States and its Indo-Pacific strategy. Military hostilities between the two large, nuclear-armed countries risk escalating into a conflagration that could involve a third nuclear power: [Pakistan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/pakistan). Such a widening conflict would be catastrophic for the region, though it now remains a remote prospect. More likely, border tensions will continue to simmer as China and India strengthen their military capabilities and build up infrastructure along the border. Washington should assist New Delhi in deterring further Chinese attempts to nibble away at Indian territory and be ready to respond quickly in case events spiral out of control. If fighting intensifies along the LAC, the United States could support [India](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/india) diplomatically and militarily, but without trumpeting this assistance. Washington could find creative ways to bolster New Delhi’s position even if it will not seek to mediate the conflict. But it must pay serious attention. The United States cannot simply ignore this escalating border dispute until it mushrooms into a full conflict, nor can it stay completely on the sidelines. ### HIMALAYAN FACE-OFF Modern China and India have never agreed on the course of their shared border, a boundary inherited from the British colonial era that passes through many remote and largely uninhabited stretches of the Himalayas. The dispute flared into war in 1962, which resulted in a resounding Chinese victory and the loss of territory for India. From the late 1980s until the mid-2010s, the border remained relatively peaceful, and the two sides engaged in sporadic talks to reduce tensions. The two countries hoped to set aside the boundary dispute and focus on other areas of their relationship. But China’s interest in consolidating its hold on Tibet (which is on the Chinese side of the LAC) and its perceptions of India’s strengthening ties with the United States led Beijing to use more strident public rhetoric around 2007. Along with its more belligerent statements, [China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/china) began taking provocative actions along the LAC, leading to two dustups, in 2013 and 2014, and a lengthy standoff in the summer of 2017 in Doklam, where the borders between Bhutan, China, and India converge and where China had tried to build a road. The completion of that road would have given Beijing a commanding military position in the area, allowing China’s People’s Liberation Army to overlook a stretch of India known as the Chicken’s Neck—a corridor connecting India’s northeastern states to the rest of the country. Fortunately, none of these engagements resulted in loss of life. That changed in June 2020 in the Galwan River valley in Ladakh, in the western sector of the border, where 20 Indian troops and at least four Chinese soldiers were killed in a hand-to-hand brawl. The clash followed a major Chinese military buildup in the spring of 2020 of 30,000 troops with tanks and artillery at five different locations along the LAC, including in areas India regularly patrolled. Beijing also later deployed fighter and bomber aircraft, rocket forces, and air defense radars at several points along the disputed border. The Chinese and Indian militaries have since pulled back forces from the most contentious positions and established temporary buffer zones, but both sides retain large numbers of soldiers along the tense frontier. A border clash that took place near Tawang, in the eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, in December 2022 was a reminder that, although recent attention has been focused on Ladakh, many other flash points along the 2,100-mile LAC could erupt into crisis at any moment. > A conflict could erupt along India and China’s 2,100-mile disputed border at any time. Beijing wants to move ahead with a broader bilateral relationship with New Delhi, regardless of the status of their border dispute, but the latter has not been obliging. It wants to condition the normalization of bilateral ties on China’s willingness to return to the positions along the LAC that existed before May 2020. New Delhi insists that the two sides still need to negotiate the disengagement of their forces in the Depsang Plains, a region in the northern part of the LAC, as well as Charding Nullah farther south. Indian officials believe China wants to force them to accept a “new normal” that would prevent India from patrolling areas over which it has previously held sway, resulting in New Delhi essentially ceding territory it claims. China’s ample resources enable its armed forces to keep building infrastructure at a brisk pace to support military operations on the border. China is beefing up its military position along the western frontier by constructing and upgrading airports, heliports, roads, railways, and other infrastructure. Beijing’s new roads go through particularly sensitive regions. For example, as part of a large national infrastructure program, China is constructing the G695 highway, connecting Xinjiang and Tibet through the region of Aksai Chin (that India lost to China in the 1962 war), which would allow it to more easily deploy troops to the LAC. Once completed, the highway would become only the second major highway constructed in Aksai Chin since 1955. Beijing is also building a bridge—its second—across disputed areas of the Pangong Lake in Ladakh, also designed to better facilitate troop deployments to the region. Finally, China has recently erected several large structures along the LAC to house troops during winter. According to one Indian estimate, the expansion of Chinese facilities over the last two years will allow China to garrison 120,000 troops (up from 20,000 troops) within 60 miles of the disputed border facing eastern Ladakh. Much of India’s troop increases along the LAC since the 2020 clash have come from redeployments and the rebalancing of its forces. For example, in June 2021, India shifted approximately 50,000 troops to the LAC—20,000 of whom were pulled from India’s disputed western border with Pakistan. India has also strengthened its defensive capabilities along the LAC, deploying drones for surveillance operations in eastern Ladakh and conducting airborne drills in the area. Closer defense ties with the United States have improved the readiness of India’s armed forces and enabled New Delhi to procure more advanced weapons systems. These procurements include systems such as Chinook helicopters for rapid troop transport and potentially armed Predator drones for expanded intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance work. India also benefits from an annual military exercise it stages with the United States called Yudh Abhyas (Training for War), which takes place in high-altitude terrain and helps India hone its capabilities against China in high-altitude combat. In early December 2022, the U.S. and Indian militaries completed the 18th edition of these exercises, this time in the mountains of India’s Uttarakhand state, just 60 miles from the LAC. China objected to the exercise, which it said violated the spirit of border agreements made between China and India in 1993 and 1996. ### THE SPOILER As border tensions between China and India remain high, Pakistan could wind up playing a significant role. The growing closeness of China and Pakistan has alarmed India, which fears that Islamabad would seek to exploit tensions between New Delhi and Beijing. Pakistan has been India’s archnemesis since the creation of both countries in 1947, primarily because of their long-standing dispute over the territory of Jammu and Kashmir. In the event of a war with either China or Pakistan, India now has to grapple with the possibility that the other country would also get involved. Indian strategists increasingly fear that they must prepare the Indian army to fight a war on two fronts. Islamabad would likely exercise caution in any potential border conflict between China and India, but New Delhi must also take into account Pakistan’s strategy and activities in any comprehensive assessment of its border dispute with China. Following the Galwan valley clash between China and India in June 2020, some senior Indian military officials speculated that Pakistan might try to exploit the fraught moment and attack Indian forces along the Line of Control (LOC) that separates Pakistani-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has thus far stayed out of the fray. In 1962, the last time China and India went to war, pressure from Washington persuaded Islamabad to avoid opening a second front. Short of opening a second front, Pakistan could still assist China in the event of a future Chinese-Indian border crisis. Pakistan could decide to conduct large-scale military exercises that would suggest readiness and a willingness to enter the fray. Pakistani military and intelligence units could encourage terrorist groups to conduct attacks against targets within Indian-administered Kashmir or in major Indian cities, as they have in the past. Or Islamabad could shift its nuclear posture in a way that would set off alarm bells in New Delhi. These Pakistani moves would force India to consider shifting resources and attention away from the LAC to the LOC, potentially to China’s military advantage. ### THE AMERICAN ROLE Indian officials believe China is trying to contain India by forcing it to divert more resources into defending both its western border with Pakistan and its eastern flank with China. Stretched in this way, India is far less likely to challenge China’s efforts to achieve regional hegemony. The violence and military buildup along the LAC in 2020 helped clarify Indian strategic thinking regarding China. Indian leaders now perceive a fundamental challenge from China just as U.S. leaders do. India, of course, does not seek or expect any direct U.S. involvement in its border dispute with China, but it should be confident that it can count on the United States for support, if requested. In 2020, shortly after the Galwan clash, the United States provided critical information and intelligence, as well as equipment, including leasing two surveillance drones. Senior Indian officials have noted privately that this support during the crisis was significant in helping India defend its borders. The [Biden administration’s](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/biden-administration) National Defense Strategy, released in October 2022, also makes clear that the United States would support India in any future border crisis with China. Still, U.S. officials should take this possible flash point more seriously, mentioning it in every strategic document and speech relating to the Indo-Pacific. The United States could also regularly criticize Beijing’s land-grabbing efforts in multilateral forums, including at the United Nations, the Shangri-La Dialogue, G-20 summits, and the East Asia Summit. Indian media outlets follow mentions of India in Washington closely. By merely referring to U.S. support for defending India’s territorial integrity, White House and State Department officials would earn the trust of India’s government and its public. > India should be confident that it can count on U.S. support. The [United States](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/united-states) should also offer India the sophisticated military technology it requires to defend its borders, and initiate the co-production and co-development of such equipment, all while encouraging New Delhi to reduce its dependence on Russian weapons. Although India has increased its total purchases of U.S. weapons by over $20 billion in the last 15 years, it has not made a major military purchase from the United States since a $3.5 billion helicopter deal signed in February 2020. U.S. and Indian national security advisers did discuss the co-production of jet engines in January 2023, an effort that, once agreed, would mark a major milestone in the two nations’ defense partnership. Washington should also establish or support an organization charged with collating unclassified commercial satellite imagery on the position of Chinese troops along the LAC and disseminate these images routinely for public consumption. This work would help make clear how the Chinese are to blame for upping the ante in their border dispute with India. Finally, Washington should message Islamabad, encouraging Pakistan to stay neutral in the event of a future flare-up along the Chinese-Indian border. Despite its long partnership with China, Pakistan has recently indicated that it does not wish to become overly dependent on Chinese assistance and would like to improve its relationship with the United States. Pakistan’s former chief of army staff and its current foreign minister both visited Washington late last year. Although the United States will probably refrain from resuming large-scale military aid, it could offer Pakistan’s beleaguered economy badly needed trade and investment, as well as support for an International Monetary Fund package. If the United States does little to back India in its border dispute with China, the latter would likely be emboldened to continue encroaching on Indian territory. Other allies and partners of the United States would take note of Washington’s seeming indifference to New Delhi’s plight, and the United States would seem an unreliable partner when it comes to countering Chinese aggression. This, in turn, would encourage other Indo-Pacific nations to placate—rather than stand up to—China and its bullying tactics, thus undermining the U.S objective of maintaining a free, open, rules-based regional order that preserves the sovereignty of countries in China’s neighborhood. The United States must follow India’s lead when offering military assistance and making statements regarding New Delhi’s border issues with Beijing. Otherwise, India may worry that the United States is needlessly inflaming the problem and recoil from U.S. overtures. Washington needs to carefully craft a low-key but still forward-leaning policy of U.S. support for India. Such a strategy will simultaneously maintain the strong momentum of the strengthening U.S.-Indian partnership while deterring China at the border.

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

How To Fix It?”, with guests: Ayush Sinhal (Founder, Kimbal), Arvind Kothari (Founder, Niveshaay & Equity Investor), and Vivek Jain (Founder, Action Tessa & Equity Investor), October 22, 2025._ ## India’s Hidden Power Crisis GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Ladies and gentlemen, India is undergoing a power crisis. While Modiji claimed to have electrified the entire country in 2018, even as of 2023, 6.7 million people did not have access to electricity in India. While we dream of beating China, India is still witnessing power cuts and our industries are still starving for energy. And while our politicians refuse to answer harsh questions on this matter, we decided to talk to those people who have absolutely no reason to fool you. While most people saw a problem, my guest today, Ayush Sinhal, built a 2,400 crore company by solving this problem. You know what they make? They make this small device called smart meters. And you can find this in any house, any industry and even in schools. But this little device today makes them 2,400 crores. Along with that, we also have Vivek Jain and Arvind Kothari who’ve been investing in India’s power sector for a decade. And they’ve made millions of dollars through their investment. So today we sat down with them to try and understand: Why is India facing such a terrible power crisis? How do we solve this problem? What exactly is their investment thesis to find hidden gems in the market? And most importantly, as entrepreneurs, how can we spot a gold mine opportunity for ourselves? Good morning gentlemen. Today we are here to talk about a national crisis, a crisis that very few people are aware of. We are talking about the power crisis. You know it’s funny that Modiji in 2018 said that we have electrified all villages in India. But even today, millions of Indians still live in darkness. India is glorified as the fourth largest economy. But even then, today our industries still face power outages. And while we want to compete with China and Germany, we are still at the mercy of oil powers and wars. Because every time oil price fluctuates, the Indian economy begins to dwindle. So we are trying everything from E20 to solar to wind to try and come out of this problem. Now, politicians often refrain from answering tough questions. Which is why today I decided to have you guys: a new age entrepreneur, a seasoned entrepreneur and an investor who invests in the stock market and generates growth in revenue. To talk about India’s power problem and how can we solve this problem and become a beneficiary of the solution. Because as investors, we can invest in power companies and become a beneficiary. As entrepreneurs, we can solve this problem and become a beneficiary so that we can be a part of the solution and not just crib about problems. Today, the agenda is pretty simple. We want to understand three very simple things. Number one, why is India facing a power crisis? Number two, as an investor, how can we choose companies that will benefit because of the solution that India will bring in to solve this power problem? And Ayush, from you I want to know, how can a new age entrepreneur build a million dollar business by solving India’s power problem? Because on the outset it looks like this is a game that is meant only for big players like Tata Power and Adani Power. And sir, from you I want an overview of this problem because you’ve been in this industry for decades so that people like me and Ayush can learn from you and become a part of the solution and hopefully make a lot of money. That’s the agenda for today’s podcast. So let’s take one minute to introduce each one of you and then we can get started with the agenda of the podcast, shall we? Sir, let’s start with you. ## Meet the Experts VIVEK JAIN: Hi, thanks for having us here. So I’m an entrepreneur having my own brand called Action Tessa, which is the largest brand for MDF and particle wood in India. We are the largest and the most innovative company in the country. And my past has been with Microtech, which is solving the power problems of the country, the largest inverter manufacturer. So I’ve seen that world closely. So that’s an interesting podcast we are having today for the discussion. And we have a family office also by the name of Arogya Capital, which we fund the right entrepreneurs. We have a framework to do it. We’ll talk about later. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Amazing. Arvind sir. ARVIND KOTHARI: Hi Ganesh, thank you for having us. So Niveshaay, we founded in 2014. The whole mindset was to pick entrepreneurs which are going to change a lot of sectors. But the whole problem was that in India, all sectors which were growing fast were either in the negative list from the banking sector’s point of view of lending, or the equity investors were not that much encouraged to invest over there because of the risk. That is where at Niveshaay, we started to take bold entrepreneur calls. And the journeys that we’ve taken with entrepreneurs like Vivekji has helped us identify companies, try to get mentors for them, try to arrange capital for them. In fact, over the years we’ve also tried to take them public all through our efforts. And that is where we want to keep on doing that journey again and again in sectors which are growing, for sectors which can really change what India’s future is going to look like. Today in a situation where we are, we believe that our founders have that energy, enthusiasm. If funded with the right kind of capital, right set of mentors, they can really unleash the kind of growth that India wants to achieve. So that’s where Niveshaay comes as a bridge to back these companies in terms of financial capital, in terms of investors they want to get on board, or mentors they want to get on board, or even other resources that they want to get on board. So that’s what Niveshaay is all about. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, can you explain what does Niveshaay do? ARVIND KOTHARI: So Niveshaay tries to pool capital from various set of investors or family offices or entrepreneurs and tries to give it to sectors or companies which are growing fast, like energy sector in the country or recycling sector in the country or maybe the computing power ecosystem that we want in the country. That’s where we are: a bridge between founders which want to grow fast and the capital which wants to get deployed in those set of founders. That’s what Niveshaay in brief does. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. Ayush. AYUSH SINHAL: Thank you Ganesh. This is the first time that I’m on the other side of the camera. Otherwise I’ve been just consuming your videos and the other podcasts throughout my life and learning from it. Thank you for giving this opportunity. I’m the CEO and co-founder of Kimbal. We started this company in 2011 with the vision to actually digitize the energy grid, the energy sector all in all. And that is what we have been doing. It’s a product company made in India, made for India and for the world. So yeah, we’ll cover the company further in detail. One thing that you said, to share how energy sector or how this crisis can give the opportunity to create a… you mentioned million dollar or a billion dollar company. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Million dollar companies. AYUSH SINHAL: Million dollar. I think this sector has the potential to create multi-trillion dollar companies. ## Understanding India’s Power Crisis GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Wow guys. First let’s understand the problem better. Why is India the fourth largest economy still facing a power problem? ARVIND KOTHARI: So we have three issues at hand. One is the coal output problem. The other is the grid infrastructure problem. Third is the T&D losses problem. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. Sir, could you please go deeper and explain each problem properly? ## \\\\# The Three Core Problems ARVIND KOTHARI: So Ganesh, if you look at what our country has been doing in the power sector, it was crippled with a lot of policy problems in the past where there was no growth in terms of coal output and still the power plants were put up. Hence these power plants could not make power at the cost that they wanted to because they had to import a lot of coal. That is where the whole crisis started. So biggest problem has been the losses, the T&D losses that our country has. It’s a problem of leakage, right? You can keep on producing more power, but if it is getting leaked out of the system, the losses keep on mounting and we have almost 15 to 16% kind of a loss versus a China where the losses are just 2%. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: 2%? ARVIND KOTHARI: Yes. So that’s where the gap… just imagine any business has EBITDA margin of what, 14, 15% at max, right? And if 15% is just shaved off from these kind of losses in a commodity kind of a sector, how can you make profits? The whole ecosystem doesn’t make profit, hence it is very difficult to seed a lot of investment in that sector. So what we are looking at, the government is trying to plug the loopholes. And please understand, India and China are at the forefront of the energy ecosystem if you think about the capabilities. And we can blame India about a lot of things. But if you go to the grids in the western world, there are grids which have not had investment for decades. They’ve invested very heavily in technology. So the 20, 25 years kind of technology bull run that the U.S. had… but it is now facing a crisis because it did not invest in the energy ecosystem in terms of grid infrastructure, in terms of power manufacturing and hence their data centers are facing a power crisis. We in our country are lucky that at least the capacities are there and capacities are getting built. It is a problem of the whole political will to reduce the T&D losses which is the forefront issue over here. Because if you look at renewable energy, our capacities are growing faster than the U.S. In China also the same thing is happening, right? So in terms of manufacturing of these components as well, solar panels, windmills, T&D equipment, India is at the forefront. In fact, U.S. is importing a lot of this stuff from India and China, right? ## \\\\# The Coal Production Challenge GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: First is, you stated that we used to import coal. We are the fifth largest producer of coal, right? Then why did we have to import coal? ARVIND KOTHARI: So the whole problem was that Coal India, which is a government monopoly, couldn’t increase its output by more than 2% for a decade altogether. And that’s where the energy demand is always higher at 7, 8% and the output of coal is just 2%. And that’s where the whole crisis of domestic coal availability, not the mines but the availability in terms of output was because of the inefficiencies that the monopoly had. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: But why? So why didn’t they produce more power? ARVIND KOTHARI: See, it’s a government undertaking, right? And it faces a lot of challenges in terms of approval. So it’s just not about whether Coal India wants to produce or not. It’s also about the judiciary and the local public, their revolt and whether approvals of those mines take time. So the whole process in a way took a lot of time. And then the bureaucracy of the company itself meant that the output could not be brought on time, which we wanted. And that’s where I guess we got crippled in this crisis which led to import of a lot of coal, exchequer doling out a lot of dollars out of the country and the whole power cost in the country did not come down, even though the capacity was there. ## \\\\# The Renewable Energy Solution So I guess with renewables that problem is getting solved. We don’t need any output which is going to come from a mine or any input which is coming from any of the natural resources. The resource which is available full time. And the whole problem is being solved by entrepreneurs and the government building an ecosystem about solar and wind, where the hybrid parks or with storage… Now, with the whole solution, now we are looking at where almost the country’s incremental demand is completely met by renewables and even replacement demand is met by renewables. And that is where I believe a lot of these challenges… if we solve the storage problem. So renewables have a storage problem. They cannot be stored. So now already the government has been working on hybrid parks where storage is also there. Two hour storage will then go to four hour storage. So I believe the problems of the past would not haunt us in the future because we’ve made very good investments in the grid and we are doing that. Power Grid has done a phenomenal job in terms of making our grid able to transact power between states. It’s very difficult. In U.S., you don’t have that. In U.S. there are states which don’t talk to each other. In India we have all the states who talk to each other in terms of energy flow and hence the ecosystem is robust. We need to upgrade it for the modern requirements of the renewable energy sector. But if that is in tandem, going hand in hand, we believe the solution to this problem is in the very near future. ## Understanding T&D Losses GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. And the second problem that you mentioned was T&D losses. Can you explain T&D losses in simple words? ## Understanding TND Losses in India’s Power Sector **ARVIND KOTHARI:** So TND losses in simple words is basically you’re producing an output of 100 units, but when it is going and reaching the end consumer, it is only reaching around 85 units. So there are 15 units being lost. 15 units can be lost due to various factors. Either you’re not stepping up and stepping down power efficiently because the grid needs to transport the power. So there can be losses in the transportation that are natural, but those also can be reduced by investment in the grid. Then there can be leakages in terms of people drawing unauthorized power in a country where a lot of consumers draw that unauthorized power. And also there can be a lot of issues in terms of manufacturing the power. So power cannot be stored, right? If it is manufactured, it needs to be dispatched. So if the demand and supply is not matched properly, we lose power over there also. So a lot of substation infrastructure needs to be upgraded to do that. ## The State of India’s Grid Infrastructure **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** And so the third problem that we spoke about was the grid infrastructure. In fact we had Shreya over here some time ago. She is the co-founder of Solar Square and she said that the grid infrastructure in India is broken and that needs to be fixed. So what do you first of all mean by a grid infrastructure and what is broken about it? **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Yeah, so what is a grid? Please understand a grid is basically an infrastructure where there are transmission lines which are set up for the power to reach the consumers. Right. So if I’m producing in for example Kachav, Gujarat, I need electricity in Surat. So it needs to be transmitted and that happens through these transmission lines. And the grid is set up by the power grid of country and it has a lot of players which help power grid to do that. But that is where the whole grid infrastructure is put up to transport power. Now this transportation can be just within Gujarat, can be just within Rajasthan or within Maharashtra. But we have been lucky that there have been a lot of investment made in the country to build a national grid which then talks to each other and then any power surplus in the state can be transported to a deficient state. And that infrastructure though is a bit outdated in certain places is needed to be fixed, but we have the necessary ingredients. I would say it is not broken to the extent that we’ve seen in Europe or maybe in the US. It is definitely much, much better as infrastructure which can enable a lot of new technologies that we are talking about. And if done properly, the TND losses in the country can also reduce if these upgrades are happening. Of course the old grid was made by a thesis that power would be made at a particular place and it would be transported to the consumers in the whole country. But now the reality is every household can be a producer of power by solar or every company can be a producer of power with solar and these kind of technologies, right? So now we have a problem that you need a two-way communication in the grid, that there can be consumers and producers at the same time at every household or every corporate. And that is where, if not properly enabled, the grid could cripple or the grid crisis could come because it is not able to do these adjustments of collecting and disseminating power. And that is where we are talking about that energy ecosystem has a great runway in our country because we will need a lot of investments to enable the grid. A lot of companies would come around with solutions of selling power to each other, which Kimbal is also in a way producing a software which can enable buying and selling of power on the exchange. So we have an exchange ecosystem in a country where power is freely traded. So what I’m trying to tell you is we can look at the problem. There is a problem. But the point is where are we in terms of the solution? So we have built the blocks already. It will require significant investment. But we are not far away out because if the basic building blocks were not there, we might have taken maybe 15, 20 years. Now with these blocks in place, we are maybe 5, 7 years away from the solution rather than 10, 20 years away from the solution. ## The Power Supply Chain Explained **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** That is amazing, sir. Ayush, could you please lay down the entire supply chain of power and help me understand how is power delivered to the households of India all the way from the production of coal? **AYUSH SINHAL:** So the start of the supply chain is the manufacturing unit which we call generation over here. So you have Coal India extracting coal and then feeding it to thermal power plants. These thermal power plants in turn then produce energy. This energy is then, so what happens is the energy has to be evacuated from the source to be taken to the destination which is the consumers like us on the grid. This is done by transmission. Transmission steps up the power so that the losses are minimized. They get from the source to the demand and then from the demand side the distribution jobs come in. Distribution role is to actually distribute power to every consumer. See how much a consumer has consumed, bill it accordingly and then do the collection. This is where the distribution comes in. So the consumer has an option to buy power either from the distribution companies or they have the power to buy power directly from a factory, directly from a generating plant. That is where these trading companies like we have IEX and PXIL coming in in the picture. So this is how if you look at the complete value chain of the energy flow through. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** So first comes Coal India, then we go to power generation. Then power transmission happens and then power distribution happens. And then we have the traders. Right. So discoms, if I’m not wrong, fall where? Power distribution. **AYUSH SINHAL:** Distribution. Yes. ## The Discom Crisis: Why Are They Bleeding Money? **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Discoms is a classic case study. For the longest time we’ve been hearing that Indian discoms are in losses. And these are not losses worth hundred crores or 200 crores. We’re talking about thousands of crores. In fact the last time I checked I think it was somewhere around 38,000 crores or 40,000 crores. So we have coal. We are getting electricity at an affordable rate. How are discoms in losses? **AYUSH SINHAL:** Interestingly, the number is way higher than that. It is around 2% of India’s GDP. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** 2% of India’s GDP? Yes. Is what we are losing. Yes. Why? **AYUSH SINHAL:** The problem is not somewhere in the demand or the supply. It is in between. So think of it as a water pipeline. Right? You are feeding water at one end and you are drawing power at the other end. The leakage is in between. And you are unable to detect where the leakages are. And you’re just bleeding or you’re just leaking energy out of that. And the system is so large that is impossible to detect without modernizing. Without actually having the information on what is happening where. And you don’t have even taps. So even if you get to know that there’s a leakage at some area, there’s no tap that you can regulate sitting over here. So that’s another challenge that you face in the grid today. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Are those TND losses? **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Yeah. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Okay. Vivek sir, can you throw more light on that as to why do we have this problem? Like Arvind sir mentioned that we lose 15% of our energy because of TND losses. And in China it’s 2 to 3%. Why is India so far behind? ## The Changing Power Ecosystem **VIVEK JAIN:** So the basic as Arvind and Ayush were talking about recently that now the whole ecosystem has changed. Earlier it was only there’s one power producer. They are consumers. And the consumer were also the quantity of consumption was less. The mind was ready. “4 hours power will not be there every day. I will go on the street, play around. I’m ready,” right? The whole mindset is changing. The power consumption increasing exponentially. Ganesh, if I ask you in your home now, earlier it was there in one bedroom. Air condition will be there now in almost, I’m sure in all your rooms the air conditioning is there. You must be using an EV now because that’s the new, I recently heard is saying no charges on an EV if you use that. Right? So people are transitioning to that. Right? So if you see the airports coming up, what are airports? They are power guzzlers, right? We see data center as now Ayush was mentioning that 99% of power will go to the AI. So that’s the whole thing happening. So now we have producers actually everywhere, right? The government was not ready. Actually nobody was ready in the world. Right? Nobody thought that the solar production, especially solar can be at any home can have a 10 kilowatt, 5 kilowatt at their home. At their home and in home the power consumption is not there because everybody goes to school, the offices and now what to do with that power. So Modi ji, the government has done a great job in getting this solar into the country and they’re working very hard today practically the solar production, the cost in India is among the cheapest in the world which is actually helping the GDP to grow. Because if we want the GDP to grow the country then the power has to be there and the power has to be rightly available plus rightly used. It cannot be wasted. As we understand from electronics that once power is produced, if it is not stored or if it’s not used, it’s gone. It’s not like it’s a perishable item, right? It’s gone. Right? So now when we see BESS coming in, the battery energy solar system coming in, right? Where companies like us, when we have power producer on the rooftop solar we have in our plant, like we have 10 megawatt right now, if we are not consuming power, we can store the power or we can supply to the grid. So that’s why the grid modernization of maybe having smart meters or maybe having SCADA system building, all those things are very important to ultimately help the Indian economy to reach to the dream which we have of 2047. That’s where I’m coming from. ## The Solar Revolution in India **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. Arvind sir, I read in your research that India is embracing solar because there has been a drastic drop in the cost of production via solar. Can you explain what that is about? And why are we suddenly seeing a rise of the solar revolution in India? ## The Solar Revolution and Smart Meter Opportunity ARVIND KOTHARI: Correct. So when we first started to bet on the solar sector, there was a lot of disbelief in the whole ecosystem, in the investment community everywhere. It’s a sector which is funded by the government. When was the… In fact, we started investing 2019, but I go far back, went on 13, 14. We in fact wrote a report which was a white paper which was presented on solar in the country and had power cost to be at 16 rupees per unit when it was made from solar versus 4 or 3 rupees that were made from coal. So solar was almost 4x more expensive than what coal output was able to produce in the country. But what was happening is that it was falling off the cliff, the power generation cost from solar because the solar panel cost was reducing dramatically. It is like every other technology like you look at computing. The computing cost has gone down by 90 percent and then gone down by 90% and then gone down by 90% almost three, four times in the past 20, 25 years. So this is what is happening with solar also. And when such a technology is reducing cost, it is very tough for its competing technologies to then take over. And you think about it as a power solution. Solar is plug and play. You look at any other… So the problem that I was talking about in the earlier piece on why Coal India output did not take pace with the energy generation because the output needs to be mined and then there should be a power plant put up by NTPC and then the power generation happens and then it needs to be transported. The whole ecosystem from mining till NTPC putting up a plant can take 4, 5 years to come together, right? If you think about solar, you just need a piece of land. Panels can be produced in the same day and they can be transported to the site. And the whole substation and ecosystem can just take 4 months, 5 months, 6 months at max to be brought to life. You think about any other solution in this world which is power hungry, as Ayush was talking about or Vivek was talking about. We need AI which needs power right now. And nuclear is talking about the solution ten years from now. [ALSO READ:Transcript: Pyramids, Lost Technology & The Flood – w/ Archaeologist Tim Alberino](https://singjupost.com/transcript-pyramids-lost-technology-the-flood-w-archaeologist-tim-alberino/) Gas powered power plants are having shortages in terms of equipment. They’re five years delays in terms of a lot of those kind of power plants that are being put in the US. Here you have a solution that can be put up as and when you want, plug and play it anywhere that you want and is reducing cost of producing power because the equipment cost is falling. Raw material is practically free. So you don’t have any variables, right? It is not that I need uranium or I need coal or I need XYZ. The power can be generated by a resource which is freely available. There is no fluctuation in terms of the timeline of putting up that power plant and there is no fluctuation in the equipment cost much. In fact, it is reducing every year. So that is where it is an insane technology which is going to be dominant no matter what the world talks about that this problem doesn’t have a solution. This has a solution. ## The Intermittency Challenge and Battery Storage The only problem with solar is that it is intermittent. It cannot be generated 24 by 7. So you have to solve for the intermittency. Now how do you solve for the intermittency? That is where battery storage comes into picture, which was also expensive if you talk about five years ago, which has reduced by almost 50% in the past five years, which can also have the same technology cost which solar had maybe 15 years ago. And it can also reduce by 90% in the coming decade. So that is where a solution of intermittency, if it is clubbed with solar, is a powerful technology which can outpace any other technology that we are talking about. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, what was the cost per unit for production of energy via solar in 2009 versus today in 2025? ARVIND KOTHARI: So 2009, if you talk about it would be around 20, 22 rupees per unit and today it has fallen off toward 1.8 or 2 rupees. That’s a kind of reduction, that almost 90% reduction in the cost that we’ve seen already. And if you talk about the equipment cost in terms of solar panel manufacturing ecosystem that our country has, it is further reducing and it will further reduce in the coming five, seven years. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. VIVEK JAIN: Cost has come to 1.6 now. ARVIND KOTHARI: 1.6. Okay, so almost like 94%, 95%. ## Micro Grids and Village Electrification GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, this makes solar almost miraculous because the cost is decreasing with time. And the best part is like you mentioned, there is no requirement of a very complex supply chain. So is it safe to say that the next 100 villages in India that will be electrified, will be electrified by solar and not the grid? ARVIND KOTHARI: Yeah. So if you think about lot of these villages can have a micro grid which can be like storage and solar just there for that ecosystem or for that village or for that cluster of villages. And you do not put them up in the main grid. That is where US is also now talking about micro grids for these data centers where they need not be connected to the grid for their energy requirements because then they can create a lot of havocs on the grid. Right? So that kind of solution already has just one bottleneck which is the power storage cost. People are talking about storing it through via green hydrogen as I was talking about, or battery storage, but both cost currently at this stage are not viable for 100% storage solution. Maybe battery energy storage is now viable for 3, 4 hours. It will get more viable when it is more viable to store energy for 24 hours. That is where we believe that the takeoff can be miraculous as you were talking about. ## The Smart Meter Opportunity GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. And this takeoff will have two massive opportunities. Firstly, because there is two way power transmission that’s happening which is where the demand for smart meters will shoot up. And secondly, there will also be a huge demand for batteries. Like Vivek sir said, power is perishable. If you don’t store it, you will lose it. So Arvind sir, is it safe to say that with the increase in number of solar panels there will also be a disproportionate increase in the number of smart meters and batteries? Which means there’s a massive opportunity there, right? ARVIND KOTHARI: So if you think about the solar opportunity is the incremental opportunity, right, that you need to put up for the energy that is being demanded every year. But the problem that you need to solve in terms of the grid communicating or the smart meter that you want to put in or the energy that you want to store, it is a problem that you need to solve for all the existing capacity and the new capacity that is going to come up. So if you look at there was a survey that was made maybe in 2016, 17 by the government where we had almost 250 million meters in the country which need to be smart. Now today that number would be anywhere between 300, 350 million. And by 2030 it is expected that it will be around 500 million meters. Now if you imagine we have only converted close to about 20, 25 million meters to smart and we have to convert now 500 million meters to be smart meters in the country. People talk about that Zomato is the biggest opportunity in the country because so many households they are serving, how many percentage of the household. And you think about how much percentage of the household will a smart meter have an opportunity to be in, collecting data, disseminating data to the government, being a piece which is solving the energy equation. So the size of the opportunity over here is huge. If you think in terms of how it is going to solve the data collection problem and the T&D loss problem and battery energy storage also, it will need to have in corporates, in households. And that is where Nandan Nilekani I guess has been talking about that it is the next UPI moment of the country. And I believe as an ecosystem this will change a lot of things that people talk about our country. If we get this act together, whatever problems that we are currently facing, people blaming India for a lot of infrastructure challenges, this, that, a lot of things from that power angle, there are a lot of things which are very rightly placed in terms of the government support, government infrastructure and the money that these companies have raised in terms of putting up that capacity in the country. So I believe that ecosystem can really be one of the best ecosystem that is investable in our country at this point. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, this is amazing. So you are telling me that India will need 500 million smart meters and we will need what, hundred companies? ## Market Consolidation and Efficiency ARVIND KOTHARI: The whole piece that the government has tried to solve is by bringing in companies which can deploy the smart meters on the ground. And they’ve been given a free hand to choose the meter companies that they want to deal with. So here you’re not communicating with the government. You are now communicating with private enterprises who are deploying the meters on ground. And the meter companies need to then become vendors with these companies. And the whole collection mechanism works in a way that the efficiency of collection is what determines your payment in terms of what you get from the government. So if the meter is not efficient, you don’t get the collection that you are aiming for. And hence the whole system is made for efficiency. So like in other sectors, what we are seeing is the most efficient company wins. So currently also in our country, there are hardly three, four companies which are like almost 80% market share in the country. And we have Kimbal today on the podcast which has become the second largest and aiming for becoming the largest. And they will have a market share of almost 30% this year. 30% in this market which is growing at this astronomical pace is what the size of the opportunity we are talking about. ## Ayush’s Origin Story GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Ayush bro, how on earth did you discover this gold mine? This is insane, bro. Because you know the reason why I think this is insane is because we often see the opportunities that are glorified. Like Arvind spoke about Zomato, Swiggy, UPI, content creation. All of these things are seen as massive opportunities. And Nikhil Kamath often says that the most amount of money can be made with boring businesses. That is why he’s made a lot of money. But tell me something. Today you generate 2,400 crores in revenue. When did you start? AYUSH SINHAL: We started in 2011. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: 2011. So you’ve been operating this company for about 14 years and today you’re generating 2,400 crores in revenue. How on earth did you discover the demand for smart meters in 2011? AYUSH SINHAL: I still remember when I was doing my engineering in Bangalore. So we all, we used to, we stayed in a flat, three of us, we stayed in a flat and we used to get our money, pocket money every month. Well, in time. But the least priority was given to paying the energy bills. So we used to approach it to pay off the Internet bill. I think the Internet bill used to come, the priority was way higher than the energy bill. And then someone from BESCOM, that was the discom in Bangalore, used to come at the end of the month, disconnect your power supply and go back. And we used to come back from college and realize, oh, there’s no power. And we didn’t pay for it. And we used to just collect the money within matter of minutes. So there was the willingness to pay was always there. It was just that the priority was low because you could afford to do that, right? And when that happens, we used to go somewhere, get the linemen to pay them, do whatever it takes and reinstate the power, right? And I still remember that led me to search if it’s happening with us. How many consumers are facing this particular piece or how many… What is the default rate of a consumer or what is the willful defaulters? You can say any number, astonish me. I still remember just to be on the conservative side and on the higher side, 92 or 93% of the energy that reaches the consumer is billed. So balance gets lost. And out of the billed only 94 or 95% is collected. So balance again gets lost. So as I said, right in the pipeline there are multiple leakages, is just one. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: So you just discovered that there were a lot of boys like yourself who are not paying electricity bills. So the discoms might be facing a problem collecting these bills. So you want to find an efficient way for them to collect money from boys. ## The Power Sector’s Fundamental Challenges **AYUSH SINHAL:** I still remember back in 2011, I was in my fourth year of college. We were still talking about what my grandfather used to talk about: electricity, food, waste. These were the rudimentary issues that we were talking about. Whereas, as a kid in a college, we were talking about smartphones, we were talking about Internet coming in 2G, 3G, 4G. But the basic pieces were just not there at pace. And as you said, glamorous industries do seek all the attention and get the best of the minds to work on it. But the power sector is the backbone of anything and everything, and it takes time to build something like this. It took us 13 to 14 years to scale to where we are. But now the trajectory is something like a hockey stick. Just recently, yesterday, I read an article by Elon Musk who says that real competition to his AI model, the Grok, is not OpenAI. It’s not Google. It is China, and China because of two reasons. One, because of the chips, the capability and ability to manufacture advanced chips, the manufacturing competency that they have. And second is the energy, the abundance of energy. AI just needs energy to function. And we are entering an era where everything and anything is touched by AI. So that is where the energy plays an important role in anything and everything that we do in the nation building, in the economy, or every company that is there. ## Spotting the Market Opportunity **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. So Ayush, like I said, you’re generating 2,400 crores in revenue by making smart meters. Help me understand, how did you spot this gap at the macro level? At the micro level, you mentioned that you did not pay the electricity bills, because of which you discovered a gap. Now, at the macro level, how did you take this company forward and how did you anticipate this growth? Or did you even anticipate this growth? **AYUSH SINHAL:** You started in 2011. We realized the energy demand in the country is going to increase like anything. There was definitely an aspirational growth that was driving the demand, and more than that, industrialization and everything. And we’ve been just discussing how energy is the key, right? So one, we were bullish on saying that the energy demand is going to increase. Second, the sector was plagued with inefficiencies. With every unit sold or every rupee of energy that you sell, if you lose one rupee, so imagine when you start selling 100 rupee worth of energy, you start making losses of 100 rupee. So that’s the second piece that we spotted. We realized there’s a massive modernization that is required to support this. And that is what gave birth to Kimbal. ## Understanding Smart Meters **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. What exactly is a smart meter and how is it different from a conventional meter? **AYUSH SINHAL:** See, the dumb meters have always been there. The challenge with the dumb meter is the information which is recording is just not accessible anywhere in the world. You have to physically access that particular device and download the data. Now imagine in India, a country like India, which has 50 crore consumers by 2030, human physically going and accessing and downloading the data is next to impossible. Whereas a smart meter has two key pieces. One, whatever information is recording, it can relay that information to a remote location, to any cloud, on your mobile phone. You can access that data. That is how it is. Second, critical piece is that it can regulate your demand. It can switch off your load, it can power on again, reinitiate your load. More than that, it can somewhere stabilize, saying that you cannot draw more than 5 kilowatt, you cannot draw more than 6 kilowatt. So this is what a smart meter does. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. **AYUSH SINHAL:** And third critical piece over here is the measurement is way more efficient than what it was done in the traditional meters. **VIVEK JAIN:** Right. **AYUSH SINHAL:** See, generally if you look at any device that you procure, so let’s say if you buy a mobile phone, you put a mobile cover to it, you put a screen laminate on top of it because you want the device to last. Whereas a consumer behavior with an energy meter or with a smart meter is that the device should stop recording from tomorrow. The first thing that a consumer gets to know when they interact with me, that we do smart metering, the first thing that they want to know is how do they stop a smart meter? How do they reduce their energy bill by the smart meter not functioning? So the meters are designed in such a way that they’re more efficient, they record the energy better, and they’re actually immune towards the consumer tampering. This is where the smart meter comes in. ## The Distribution Model **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. So after making these meters, who did you go and sell this to? **AYUSH SINHAL:** We sell this to Discoms. In Delhi, we have Tata Power and BSES is the discom. So they are our customers. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** When you sell this to Discoms, they then go and install these meters at the customer’s house. **AYUSH SINHAL:** Most of the discoms in the country are government owned. 95% of the discoms in the country are public sectors. Right now the government realized that it is impossible for them, for the discom people and for them to roll out such a massive operation in time. We’re talking about 100% replacement. This massive activity has never been done anywhere in the world. So what they did was they called intermediary. In between, smart meters come in with different components and they together solve a problem of the customer which is better revenue, better collection, better efficiency. **VIVEK JAIN:** Right. **AYUSH SINHAL:** These components are: one is the smart meter which is the measurement box. Second is the connectivity, getting the data online. And third is application running on the cloud which is processing the data and converting into information. These three together they form a solution. They actually address your problem. You buy any of the best component, a single component not interacting well together or not integrated well together will have zero impact. So here what they did was they said I need an integrator in between. I need the integrator to select the three different components, deploy it on ground, and then run it for life. This is where a company like contracting companies like Tata Power, Adani Power or Nagarjuna Construction Company, Monte Carlo, these are the companies. They come in, they win the contract from the Egyptian company, and then we supply to them. ## Demand Regulation and Consumer Behavior **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. How can it regulate the demand and supply? Because by deploying a smart meter, you can definitely measure efficiency. I’m able to envision how will the calculation be more accurate as compared to the existing meters. But how will the regulation happen? How will you prompt me to stop charging my car? **AYUSH SINHAL:** So what I can do is I can regulate by saying that, okay, the charges are in kilowatts. Let’s say your normal demand of an AC and a light may be 3 kilowatt. The charger puts an additional load of 3 kilowatts. So I can put a ceiling of saying that you will just draw 3 kilowatt for this period of time. As soon as your energy goes above that, your electricity completely will be cut off. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** But wouldn’t that require my permission? **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Yes. **AYUSH SINHAL:** So obviously you need to participate in programs like this. And what is happening is, see, you will be incentivized to participate over here and your tariff will go down eventually. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Can you explain? **AYUSH SINHAL:** So what will happen is, I’ll give you again an example. In Maharashtra, the chief minister has come up with a fantastic program where he’s saying that the consumer will have a different tariff for solar hours and a different tariff for non-solar hours. This is called time of use billing. **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Time of use billing. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Okay. **AYUSH SINHAL:** So eventually the consumer will start charging their vehicles during the solar hours. You’ll wash your clothes during the solar hours and eventually your bill will reduce. So this is how playing with the demand and supply eventually reduces your energy cost. So here I’ll come as a utility, maybe over here as a Maha Discom. I’ll come to you and Ganesh, I’ll say, “Ganesh, if you participate in a demand response program whenever there’s crisis, I want you to reduce your load. I want you to reduce your load maybe by 20%, 30%.” And you can do that because these are the auxiliary loads or supply that you have, which you can always do. If you do that, I’ll give you a rebate of 20% over your total bill. See, because the utility, when there’s crisis, when the power plant from Kutch didn’t supply, when they have to go to a trader like an IEC to buy, they buy the power which is generally available at 2 rupees or 3 rupee, at maybe 15 rupee, at maybe even 20 rupee. Whereas as a consumer we will be paying only around 6 to 7 rupee. So that is where for them, for you to cut down your, regulate your demand, will eventually reduce the overall power cost. ## The Equity Question **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** One question that I had, Ayush, is that when it comes to a poor consumer, for them this incentive means a lot. They can actually change their habits just so that they can have these incentives. But as you go to the top of the pyramid, the incentive is not lucrative enough. For example, if you tell me that I will save 20% of my electricity bill if I don’t charge my car, I will never listen to you. So isn’t this in a way controlling the behavior of the consumer at the bottom of the pyramid while giving all the liberty in the world to the people at the top of the pyramid? Because as they say, fine is nothing but the amount of money that you pay to commit the crime. **VIVEK JAIN:** Interesting, right? **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** So here you’re essentially telling me that instead of the fine, incentive is just a better word for a fine. Because what you’re essentially doing is that you’re changing the pricing structure in such a way that instead of saying that I will take money from you, you’re saying that I will take less money from you if you do a certain thing, a certain way. So don’t you think that is an injustice being done to the people at the bottom of the pyramid? **AYUSH SINHAL:** See, again, if you look at the country, today, 90% of the users sit in that pyramid. If you’re able to reduce the cost by whatever it is and by getting the consumer to participate in that particular program, that is fantastic. And over there, 20%, 30% matters a lot. And it is just not 20%, 30% of today’s cost. The cost is increasing because the behavior trend is changing. Today, the EVs, the two wheeler, three wheeler or four wheelers, whatever they have, they’re going to be charged from the grid. Now, that percentage of the money is spent on petrol or diesel or something like that. So the bill is going to increase. And over there, the 20, 30% matters immensely. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. But EVs are extremely costly. And if you look at the behavioral pattern of consumption at the bottom of the pyramid, it’s usually only for necessary consumption. It’s used for fans and not ACs. It’s used to watch TV, which the poor consumer watches barely for an hour. It’s used for charging your phone or it’s used for studying. And if you tell them that if you consume less power or if you consume power at a certain time, don’t you think the father of the house is going to care more about the electricity bill than the child who’s studying under the fan? ## From Consumer to Prosumer **AYUSH SINHAL:** So a couple of things over here again. One, I will link it to the PM Suryaghar Yojana that we have. The Prime Minister of the country has a very ambitious goal of saying that 1 crore household will have a solar panel on their rooftop. Now interestingly, for a certain set of consumers, just from being consumers you can become a prosumer or you can become a producer. What do you mean by producer is, I am a generator now. I am producing power and I can sell it to the grid. I can sell it to my peer. This is what Arvind sir, when he mentioned that Nandan Nilekani is saying and he’s been consulted by the government of saying that let’s create an Indian energy stack and that can be India’s next UPI movement. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. **AYUSH SINHAL:** Where Indian energy stack means every device will start communicating in a universal method and these consumers can start trading energy. So let’s say when I have extra power I can just give it to you Ganesh and I can sell it to you and you can pay me. So instead of just being a consumer of power I can start earning money out of it by producing and selling. **GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN:** Got it. So what you’re saying is that we will not just change the way people use power but we’ll also enable people to produce more power. Because of which they won’t be constrained. **ARVIND KOTHARI:** Yes. ## Identifying Investment Opportunities in Energy Solutions GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Correct. Okay. Whom should I approach? Let’s say I have a solution for this. Whom should I approach? AYUSH SINHAL: Utilities today are hungry for solutions like this. Today the new age utilities like Tata Power, like Adani, they’re waiting for someone to come in and offer them something. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Can a youngster come and do this at Kimbal? AYUSH SINHAL: Definitely yes. The journey that you were talking about, right from 2011, from a 10 lakh revenue company to a 2,400 crore company, right? This has been done because of the people that we have. So this company truly believes in people. The whole culture that we have, we have a culture of saying that there’s a culture of absolute trust in candor. We believe in saying that there’s no rules and we mean it. You know, today any individual, so there’s no age bias in this organization. I think one, me being so young, that today on a table a 23 year old kid’s voice and a 50 year old voice has the same weightage. So that’s one beautiful thing that we’ve done over here. Another thing to look at, see today, if I want to buy equipment, if I want to allocate a budget and whatever the amount may be, I’m scared of saying that in front of my investors. But whatever that amount may be, whether it is 10 lakh, 1 crore, 50 crore, if you’re aligned towards the company’s goal, if you’re aligned towards the company vision, you don’t need any approval. So that is the kind of culture that we’ve built. There is zero attendance over here. There is zero expense policy. We just have a book of trust. You need to align yourself with that. So what do we believe is the problems this energy transition is throwing at you? It is something new. This problem was just not there yesterday. Yesterday we were not talking about solar, right? These problems have come up now. [ALSO READ:Transcript of Michael Shellenberger on The Tucker Carlson Show](https://singjupost.com/transcript-of-michael-shellenberger-on-the-tucker-carlson-show/) So you need newer solutions. So this is where agility matters. This is where innovation matters. And Kimbal is a perfect platform for that. Kimbal has built that platform where someone can just come in, think of a problem, think of a solution and start running towards it. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: That’s amazing man. So are you telling me that an intern can come into your company, identify a problem and get a budget to build an enterprise within an enterprise to go and solve that problem? ## AI-Powered Grid Solutions AYUSH SINHAL: Very recently we had three kids from IIT Delhi and three from IIT Bombay. They ended up building a solution which can be explosive, which can change the complete way the grid operates. Today again, young kids, they don’t know anything. They’re not bounded by any limitation, right? What they did was they worked very closely with the utility, with the discom in the country. By just analyzing the data, they were able to map which transformer supplies power to which all consumers. This is one of the most difficult things. Generally people go physically and map it. Okay, this is the transformer. The wire is going to Ganesh’s house, the wire is going to Vivek’s house, the wire is going to Arvind’s house. So this transformer is applying to these three houses. What they did was using AI, they found a signature through which with a 95% accuracy, they have been able to detect which consumer is connected to which transformer. Now this particular simple solution can literally cut down the 2% losses to zero overnight. So 2 lakh crore losses can go down to zero. Because this enables certain functionality for the utility to be used where they can pinpoint the leakages, where they can pinpoint the losses and plug it immediately. That is the power of this particular solution. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Understood. So the first opportunity lies in data analysis. The second and third opportunity lies in the second piece. ## Three Major Opportunities in Energy Tech AYUSH SINHAL: We are all talking about EVs and I think every other house has an EV today, right? For an EV you don’t go to a petrol pump, you go to a charging station. The electrons are flowing and charging, right? A simple app to unify all the charges has massive potential, right? Just not that, scheduling when to charge, when not to charge is going to have massive potential. So vehicles, you need to think of vehicles as batteries, as moving batteries on the grid which can be plugged in and plugged out as and when required. So the concept is called V2X or V2G, vehicle to grid. This particular domain is explosive. You can have hundreds of Kimbals just in this particular domain itself. Third one I believe solar, right? Solar has again tremendous potential. ARVIND KOTHARI: Again. AYUSH SINHAL: You have a solar park. There’s a lot of analysis that you can do. You can work with the data to increase the yield of that particular asset and it doesn’t require any cost. So you put in hundreds of crores to put in that capex of solar plant and maybe just with lakhs of rupees you can increase the yield by percentages. So that is one. The PM Surya Ghar Yojana where the prime minister’s ambition is to put in 1 crore rooftop solar. Now these consumers becoming prosumers. So imagine Ganesh trading energy with Ayush in a real time basis. You have excess energy just like UPI. You PayTM me that energy and I start using it. Now this P2P trading or how do I access my solar better, how do I feed it to the grid better? This particular opportunity again is tremendous. These are just three of the opportunities that’s coming on top of my mind. There are hundreds of them like that. ## The Entrepreneurial Approach to Investing GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it? Understood. Arvind sir, how do you, how did you choose Kimbal and how do you pick companies like these? Because I have read your research papers and the thesis are just so comprehensive that even a newbie will be able to understand the progressions of the Indian stock market very well, right? In fact we’ve presented a lot of your research papers on our videos also. So help me understand how do you identify these companies which eventually go on to become multi-baggers. ARVIND KOTHARI: So the approach when I actually came to investing was that of entrepreneur because my family background was entrepreneurship. I was in a city which in Gujarat we have entrepreneurship mindset. So the normal way of working, people just try to understand the mechanisms of the market functioning. That never appealed to me. In fact, I failed at investing initially because I was trying to get into that rut of understanding the market. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: What do you mean by that now? ARVIND KOTHARI: By meaning to understand the market dynamics is to know how the market is behaving. The behavior of the market is very complex. Every day there are millions of buyers and sellers trying to decide the price of a company. And deep down inside I could not understand that behavior because I thought on first principle basis, it’s a business which has value and the value over the years increases if it is able to grow in terms of its capabilities and the revenues can come later. The capability part is important because I had seen a lot of companies in the family, within us, a lot of good businesses go down because the capabilities were not being built and a very small business becoming very big even though they were struggling for a decade because they were building capabilities and learning over the years. So my mindset always was that if I am able to deploy that analogy to understanding businesses in the market, that is where I am more comfortable. I am not that comfortable understanding the market behavior. The human psychology of investing or whatever the books in investing are written about, are written about the psychology of what an investor is or on the psychology of how the markets, and we have stories like this where the greatest of the greatest were being bankrupted in the markets because they could not understand the psychology of the market. So how we started is, let’s forget about what the psychology of the market is. I don’t know that. Can I understand how a business functions and can I understand how value is created in a business? That is what the starting point was. And initially for almost seven, eight years, we did not have a business model because we were trying to put up research papers as you very rightly talked about. And in India no one pays for that research, right? Then we started to think that can we bring those research papers to people who are entrepreneurs themselves? And that is where the business model Niveshaay came live, where entrepreneurs like Vivek ji or like a lot of family offices that we have, we presented to them investments like their own business investments and not like any other stock market investment. I remember when I met Vivek ji, he had some 50 mutual funds, some 30, 40 other funds that he was investing with. VIVEK JAIN: Total 98. AYUSH SINHAL: Total 98. ## Building Capabilities Over Time ARVIND KOTHARI: And I thought that why is he approaching this? And the returns were okay, but they were not great. And in his business he was hitting the ball out of the park, right? And then I tried to discuss with him that at Niveshaay, we solved this piece long back, which you have a starting point. Since day one, you can be very good at investing because you’re a very good businessman. And I truly believe that getting mentorship from people like Vivek ji or from the entrepreneurs has helped me more than getting mentorship from people who are from the market. And that’s where we look at how over the years a capability is being built and capabilities don’t get built in a day or two. Capabilities take a decade to build. Look at whatever has happened, game changing in the world. The revenues or the profitability of the past decade have been dismal. They have been like, no one would have looked at that investment if they were talking about four, five years ago period. And they completely come to the hockey stick. And that is when the whole public is wanting to invest. And that is where I thought, can we have a bridge? Can we find these opportunities at the right juncture? And that’s where we started to go very deep down into sectors. We don’t invest in banking or mature sectors. We take up sectors where nothing might have happened but capability might have built up. And we’ve tried to find out that juncture where the hockey stick is going to maybe play out or maybe even betting when we feel that the capabilities are ripe now. Whether it delivers in two years, three years, five years, we don’t know. But I’m getting this opportunity now. I might not get it if I delay this. So that is where we over the years done a lot of work in a lot of sectors. And in 2019, 2020 when Covid hit, we had this huge, you can say, realization that the technologies which are going to lead our country to the future are something which are not being very well represented in the listed equity market. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: What do you mean by that, sir? ## The Power of Pattern Recognition in Investing ARVIND KOTHARI: By that, what I mean is that if I look at the biggest problem that Covid was trying to solve is that how everything can be delivered at home, how you can have a power supply and Internet connection and everything, the data can be transmitted easily because people were working remotely, right? And if you look at most of these technologies were in the US and nothing was there in India. But we had service providers, we had companies which were trying to build solutions around it, but most of them were not listed. What goals countries took after Covid was coming out is that our planet was breathing much better when Covid shutdowns were happening. So we need more clean energy. And if you look at in our country, we had the giants like NTPC and Tata Power all listed, but very few were talking about clean energy. That is where we realized that power sector is one sector or energy overhaul is one theme that will play out in multiple countries at the same time. Because of this requirements of data, because of this requirement of the greenhouse gases which were the goals that countries were. The first thing every country after Covid that came and said was that we have this net zero goal by 2030 or 35 or whatever. So that is where we try to link things. And that is where we thought that in our country we have solar energy policies which were in place. There was nothing in terms of, you can say, fixation of those policies which were very difficult to crack on ground because the power cost was already going down. And then there was a layer of export demand that came for equipment in our country because China was shut down. And there were a lot of problems that people thought in the western world that we cannot be importing a lot from China. So the whole supply chain rearrangement happened and India kind of became a bright spot where a lot of these turbines, solar panels, a lot of these engineering equipment was trying to be sourced from. And we do a very deep work into understanding the culture in India. We don’t have a very big culture of burning money like in the western world. It is there for technology. But we have a lot of engineering talent and that engineering talent. ## India’s Engineering Advantage We have produced engineering giants like L&T. We produce a lot of, you can say giants which are making gears, giants which are making a lot of these components which are engineering led. And that gives us a huge runway in terms of fitting that culture with the manufacturing ecosystem and bringing this whole power equipment piece alive. And that’s where we started investing in companies which were building components in solar like panels like you can say glass. And also then focusing on technology piece where we then understood that the whole transmission network needs an upgrade because the two way communication problem of the solar that is there, hence there will be a lot of transformer demand that will be there in the country. So when we were talking about transformer, a lot of investor friends of me told me, “Arvind, all these Baroda people, you know, there are hundreds of transformer companies every gully you go to Baroda, why this sector is investable. This has not made return for 10 years.” And then Elon Musk talks about that the biggest shortage that the world has seen will be in transformers, right? So these kind of things are very difficult to imagine if you’re a normal investor sitting in a Bombay or a Delhi office and just looking at the macro picture. You need a lot of data points on ground. How so many companies in transformer had gone bankrupt. What were the problems? What is the current need of transformer is multifold because of the upgrade that is being required in. And if someone read the policy document that the government was publicly sharing that what bids they were inviting in solar, what bids they were inviting in the transmission capacity, one could easily figure out. But the problem was the numbers were not there. ## The Smart Meter Opportunity Yeah, similar problem with smart meters. There was a lot of policy that the government brought and they were talking about these numbers that we had this 250 million people and we need to shift everything into smart meters. But the numbers were not coming. And hence people were having this disbelief. But that is where we thought that if there is an entrepreneur who is solving this problem, this is a 500 million meter problem by 2030 and 500 million meter in household where you can take data from them. We thought there can be a lot of layers. But the problem is that the existing players were thinking in a very mundane fashion. And when first time, you know, I got the Kimbal deck they were trying to raise money since almost a year. And they might have met some 30, 40 organizations. I guess they could not. No one felt that this was an exciting. And I initially three times my analysts came to me and told and I thought I have listed companies in this space. Why should I even look at Kimbal? But one very interesting piece that my analyst tried to influence me was that the only company which is working on the whole solution that is the smart meter also the communication and dissemination of the data. And that was something which was very powerful. And then. But again, I look at the numbers, I get discouraged when I decided let’s make a visit to this guy, understand what he’s doing. ## The First Meeting with Ayush And the first meeting when I was told that you could sometimes, you know, have to call tractors to, you know, enter that place. So when I entered Munka, I thought why should I even be spending time on this company which is based out of Munka, a small 10,000 square feet kind of a setup. You look people here and there. But I have figured out in my life is that if you can draw parallels, see, it is nothing you’re doing past analysis. Nothing is going to add value. What is the future if you can draw parallels that if something had happened in some other sector an entrepreneur trying to solve and what then eventually happened. So when I first met Ayush, his obsessiveness with smart meter as a solution was very hard hitting. And his obsessiveness with what solution he can deliver is the best solution that his consumer wants. Not just the utility but the consumer end consumer which I had not heard any company to talk about. And then I could relate that was Jeff Bezos also trying to do that. If someone visited Bezos back in 97, 98, he had this obsessive, you know, mindset that boss, I can so solve the problem of a book library. That cannot be done physically, I can do it digitally. So first I remember first time when we invested the monthly revenue was around 5 to 7 crores every month it was fluctuating. But the point is that every two, three months when we used to interact they were this bunch of energetic people. They could hire people from Tata Power, they could hire people from GE. They were bringing in talent which was unheard of. Again in my investing history I have heard that people who can draw talent are the entrepreneurs who built successful enterprises. So even though the data was not encouraging but the capability was getting built up. AYUSH SINHAL: No profit, no profits, but the capability. ARVIND KOTHARI: Was getting built up. One year down the line, again the profitability is elusive and my investors, Reggie is not asking but other investors are getting jittery. Boss, where are the profits? What is happening with the company? And then comes a time when they need capital. And again I’m visiting them with this mindset. Boss, we will provide capital. And out of the meeting I’m coming out boss, we can provide them even 200 crores because what they’re building is something phenomenal. And the good part was that me and could convince the other investors that this is a company which is building something which is very unique. Just don’t look at the profitability but the capability can highlight as a mentor because his role has been phenomenally there to build that profitability piece, to build that discipline, to build that mindset which a large company thinks about and how Kimbal as a startup can think like a large company. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: How did you do that, sir? ## The BCON Framework VIVEK JAIN: So the exciting part, you know one of our framework which we use in our investment now is called Beacons. Sorry BCON. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Okay. VIVEK JAIN: The BCON is like who’s showing the torch towards the. Like this. He’s one of that entrepreneur, right? So when we saw talk about BCON like it’s talk about the bold. The bold initiatives. I first met him, he came to my home, Arvindji called me that. Okay, let’s meet him. He called and I think so we. AYUSH SINHAL: Spoke for three to four hours and. VIVEK JAIN: The deal was done on the day, the same day. And in the morning 6am he had messaged me we are on and we can go avoid, right? So the decision making has to be very quick and has to be bold. That’s where Kimbal talks about. Then we talk about E is the ethics, the integrity, the integrity level at their company, their family. I checked it with my connect because as he was staying very close to my place so I could get some connect. The first thing the connect told me “Vivek bande dhi ghe kaan gya Garth you can invest money” and there the starting point comes out, right? And you know when we started to see the culture they’ve got ranked 34th in the great place to work recently. ARVIND KOTHARI: Oh wow. VIVEK JAIN: Coca Cola is 35. AYUSH SINHAL: 32. ## Building a World-Class Culture VIVEK JAIN: 32, right. The Coca Cola is 32. They are 34. A startup kind of a company getting that ranked in the country. And when you go to their culture I had happened to visit their, you know, their annual day and you know there are 400 people and you could see that there are 400 Ayush sitting there talking with such passion. I’m doing this, I’m doing this, I’m doing this. This I don’t find in my company. This is the culture they have built, right? And when we say that oh the BCON. Oh openness to the competition, you know, very interesting incident. I will tell you. I was, I was. They had a big exhibition in the greater Noida, right? And their Kimbal mega plant which is from 10,000 square feet now to 2 lakh square feet, two and a half lakh square feet they had built up and they had a bid exhibition. So I told me “Vivek, we have, you know planned that anybody who comes here can go to the visitor plant.” I asked him “come on hell, how can you do it? They can be competitors who will be there.” He said “what is the problem? Let them, let them go. We should be far ahead of competition. What they’re thinking today we have done it already.” So that is that the openness to competition is there, right? I missed the A part of it, you know, the BCON the A. The agility part. The agility and speed is. I still remember the incident we had invested in January 24. If that the first round, the 350 crore, right? And they took us some. They paid on the money and then they took us this greater node of the Kimbal mega plant before the rent started ticking in they’d already started production. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Wow. ## Speed and Innovation at Kimbal VIVEK JAIN: In. In, you get a period, right? You get a period to put up their place and all. They’d already started production, right. Whenever we go to their place now or we meet their team, there’s something new happening. As Arvind just now mentioned about they had this EMS piece coming in. I am sure that Kimbal is one company which will breed groom at least 25 more companies out of Kimbal in the similar sector solving different problems. Like one problem is the EMS, the data trading second piece they’ve already developed, which is the software which is on your mobile, which can actually tell you which is the device in your home, which can have a safety hazard. You know, we all worry that there can be fire at the home, right. If you are knowing in advance that this is your device which is not working on your app and in the app you can switch it off. Yeah, right. It is wonderful. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: That’s incredible, right? ## Investing in Speed and Innovation GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: That they’ve already built, right? Then they are also showing that this is the power guzzler in your home. And if you can run at the solar hours, you can save power. This is like helping the country. It’s not only making money, right? Making money is of course a byproduct. Now this kind of agility and speed, it’s like a big learning to us. How can Action Tessa bring that speed, right? That’s the fun part of it. And the second last piece is the end-to-end thought vision, right? They’re already thinking about what their competitors are doing. They have a proper system of benchmarking the competitors, what they are doing, what kind of product they have. Because finally we have to fight on the price also. So they have a big program running on the cost. And the cost is not just to reduce, it’s reverse engineering to innovate. Just for an example, in a smart meter they are able to make a smart meter in 38 seconds, 36 seconds. Right now they have pressure from the market that they want more production. But the space is constrained, already 2.5 flex wave, it is gone. Now they’re building up new space. Now their team, Anirudh, Ayush and their team has built up that they can reduce it to 18 seconds. That means double the production with no investment, right? So you can understand what kind of numbers they can throw in, right? And the second piece they are working heavily on is the quality piece, that the failure rate, because when a smart meter goes and installs at Ganesh’s home and it gets faulty, the discom is having a problem. AYUSH SINHAL: They cannot earn money. VIVEK JAIN: Yeah, they will tell the AMISP, “Boss, job now that is thousand bucks.” If their failure rate can go down, the job is done. Why would anybody, because the price will always fight. But the technology they are building, the quality they are building is enormous. So that is the kind of entrepreneurs we love to work with. ## Case Study: Betting on Undervalued Companies GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Sir, can you walk me through three such examples where the companies on the outside were not doing well and you bet on those companies, you were bullish on those companies, you worked with those companies and eventually today they’ve paid you dividends far beyond people’s imaginations? ARVIND KOTHARI: So the first example that I can come up with is a company called HLE Glasscourt which in a way was a group which was unlisted. But they bought a company called Swiss Glass Coat which was listed on the exchanges in India. And they had 100 crores kind of a market cap. Now it was a very small company. 100 crore would not move the needle for much of the funds. And the reason why we got excited was that the promoter family was one of the friends of my cousin, which I knew them since almost seven, eight years. And their capability, I knew how they had built, how they think, how Alab, and he was a young engineer used to think and how he could bring that learnings to his own company and build that up. And now that he can do the same thing with the company that he’s acquired. And that is where a small company of 100 crores got a valuation of close to a billion dollars in the coming four or five years because they went into adjacencies, they reverse merged their own business with this listed company. So this company was making glass line reactors. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: What is that, sir? ARVIND KOTHARI: The glass line reactor is a reactor which pharma and chemical companies use to mix a lot of their chemicals and store it also. So here is a company which was just doing a turnover of 40, 50 crores. But the point is that when they merged these two entities, they had this lethal combination of a giant which can be a supplier of pharma and chemical plants. Almost 30% of the value chain was dryers, filters and glass line equipments. So all pharma giants or chemical giants had to come to this company whenever they were thinking of a plant. And in India we were going through this boom of chemicals and pharma because if you look at Gujarat or Hyderabad, most of these pharma giants were talking about 4x capacity, 5x capacity. Chemical plants were talking about 10x capacity because we had a capability in the country regarding these two manufacturing of materials. We thought a player like HLE in the merged form is on the forefront of supplying those critical equipment for this company, for this industry to grow. And that is where there was a time period then in 2019, there was a three years kind of waiting period. That waiting period increased to four, four and a half years in 2021. So the capability they were building, still they could not completely fulfill the needs of the consumer. [ALSO READ:Transcript: AI Safety Expert Dr. Roman Yampolskiy on The Diary Of A CEO Podcast](https://singjupost.com/transcript-ai-safety-expert-dr-roman-yampolskiy-on-the-diary-of-a-ceo-podcast/) And that is where Malabar kind of funds came into. Other funds came into when the company’s market cap fell to 3,000, 4,000 crores and it went to almost 8,000, 9,000 crores. And the capability of Alab as an engineer was something which drove me to take that bet. And that mindset created an organization which is one of the largest value creators if you think about in terms of a merger story that Indian corporate had ever spun. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: So you invested in this company when it was valued at 100 crores and today it is sitting at a valuation of 8,000 crores? ARVIND KOTHARI: At the top it went to around 8,000 crores. Today it might be around 4,000 crores. ## The Investment Framework GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Okay, got it. So sir, if I have to break down your framework, you first look at a megatrend, something like, let’s say PM Suryaghar Yojana, which is going to substantially increase the demand for a particular capability in India. Correct. So it could be about solar panels or it could be about glass lining equipment. Once you identify that, you go and scout for entrepreneurs or companies who have the capability to service this demand. And once you identify them, then you get into a framework, then there is another framework which then goes deeper from the entrepreneur all the way to the culture of the company, to the integrity of the company, to the energy of the people who are running the company. And on the basis of that you decide to invest in a particular company, not on the basis of the numbers but on the basis of the capability of the company to cater to a future demand. And that is where you’ve been able to experience hockey stick growth. Is that correct? ARVIND KOTHARI: Yes. Because if I’m betting on the numbers which are already there, why will the market reward me anything? Because if I’m already betting on a giant like Reliance which has already created thousands of crores of profitability, it will not move the needle if they create few thousand more crores of profitability because they’ve already been discovered by the market. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. Give me two more examples, sir. ## Case Study: Waaree Energies ARVIND KOTHARI: So the second company that we bet on is Waaree Energies which again if you think of, and we were thinking about that bet, it was in solar where India had no chance to succeed, right? China was the leader in that sector. And China was in a way dominating this space. Almost 90% of the equipment world over were Chinese equipment. And when the idea came to us, everyone again started, including Vivekji. First call, he was saying, “We buy panels in Microsoft, protect from Waaree and all these players, commodities and why commodities should get any value.” But what we observed is that here’s an entrepreneur who survived in an industry which was dominated by China, had no profitability or close to zero profitability. He himself went on the verge of getting drained of all his resources in the company twice. And he sold some other business of his that he had in engineering wall business which he sold to a European counterpart and brought capital to this company to make it survive. That is a passion that he carried for this business. And in COVID we remember that all the Chinese people had a force majeure clause on supplying to us panels to the US because the shipping cost just went through the roof. So everyone said we are not supplying. Here is a small company from India living up to the contracts and saying, “Forget about force majeure, forget about the losses I am going to supply, whatever loss, every container that I’m making.” And that is where he stood and delivered which no other company either in India or China delivered. And that is where he won the trust of the US counterparts. And this cannot be captured in numbers, right? Because when you talk about the US demand, there were a lot of Indian engineers who were there which were working in these EPC companies who were placing orders. They did not have a proper alternative to China for all these years. And hence they were not putting these orders and when we talk to them. So the main ingredient over here is generally investors don’t take stock of the situation on ground and what is it changing as a trend for the future. VIVEK JAIN: And also to add on the Waaree piece is what’s very important, Dharmeshji’s capital allocation and his time of equity raising was very particular because this was an industry not having profits. And that time, if you have a lot of debt on your book, you can be screwed. He was raising the equity in the right time and also doing the allocation at the right time. As investors generally we miss that. We just see numbers. Boss, understand the space, go talk to the founder, go talk to the market what’s happening and see if the situation is not improving for one year also, is there any problem? If the company can survive that tough time then the good times will come, then it will flourish. And this has happened in Waaree, right? This is happening in Kimbal now, right? ARVIND KOTHARI: And the ability that Vivekji is talking about, Hitesh Bhai raised capital of around 1,000 crores without any investment banker being appointed, without even a rupee of investment banking fees being paid. We raised close to around 180 crores in the company in two rounds. And when I just reached out to one of the family members that we raised this amount, we’re very happy with the investment. But if there can be a fees. So the feedback that I got, “We are not charging any fees.” I told, “Why will you charge a fees? You need to pay a fees to us to basically raising this capital.” But we were happy with the investment. AYUSH SINHAL: We did not make any money on the fees. ARVIND KOTHARI: But the investment was such superb that we were very excited and we went ahead. The point is that he was very clear that “I don’t want these kind of term sheets being written by these big investors and try to dominate of how I want to build my business. I have spent almost two decades understanding this business. I don’t want a third party to come and explain me that why are you making losses on this container that you’re shipping out to the US” because he was building a relationship. He was building a relationship which was going to last. And the point is that relationship helped him to have close to $1 billion in advances to build factories which now is around 14 gigawatts which is going to go to 20 gigawatts just in a year’s time. And the starting point was just a 500 megawatt factory to this 20 gigawatt factory spread across US, India. No other giant like Adani could even fathom doing that. And that is where he started to serve the US market. That was our thesis. India market was commodity and Waaree at least will make money out of that from things turning the table and India policy then going live and ALM ticking in where Indian government told that, completely changing the India business for them. So point is that betting on right things gave unimaginable opportunity in India itself. And now India is talking about energy storage and Waaree is talking about energy storage. India is talking about green hydrogen, Waaree is talking about green hydrogen. So they have transformers, everything. In fact, that is a beauty about these great founders. Again that I am repeating in the sake of it, but that is the building blocks that they find adjacencies and are able to replicate the same success in the other adjacencies. VIVEK JAIN: And also leave money on the table. Yeah, all these founders like Hiteshji and even Kimbal, they have always left money on the table for the investors. This is also crucial because if the founder is only thinking that “I should have the whole piece of the cake,” then the investors of course will not back them, right. Hiteshji and Kimbal of course have been doing that, right. And we have seen other founders also who have been quite successful that they have to take everybody along in the growth story. That is also important. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: You entered Waaree at a market cap of 4,500 crores and today it is sitting at a market cap of 80,000 crores. So that’s almost a 20x return. That’s insane. And the last company, sir, the third? ## The Power of Long-Term Thinking in Investment ARVIND KOTHARI: Company, or I can say again an ecosystem, again with the same mindset that we bet on was the electronic manufacturing in the country where there are multiple companies that we bet. But again, China is the leader over there. We cannot compete with China and the other southeastern nations and we don’t have an ecosystem, some things like that. But if you look at the Indian imports, the second item after oil was electronics. And that is where the government was framing policies that how we can become a self-sustaining nation in electronics. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: How much was the return that you generated from this? ARVIND KOTHARI: So Aventel would be at what, 2000% up for us. Maybe HBL was 700% up for us. That’s a kind of multiplier that we’ve made. But we’ve been lucky that these companies delivered what we thought and delivered much more than we thought. See, I did not imagine that Kimbal would be doing an EMS so successfully or would be executing so successfully or a 2000 crore kind of a business in a single year. It’s something very unique that they’ve built. Maybe something very unique that the order book that came to worry or HBL getting Kavach orders. This was something which we just hoped and some things we didn’t even hope came out of the blue. But betting on the right set of people and the right set of sector was something at a valuation gave us a lot of returns. ## Key Investment Advice for Multi-Bagger Returns GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. Sir, if you were to sum up your entire thesis and give out one takeaway to all the investors who are looking for these multi-baggers, what would your research advice be? ARVIND KOTHARI: So I have always thought through that. We’ve discussed this with my team also that what is our thesis, what do we bet on and how do we come across this serendipity where we come across companies like Kimbal or Worry. And what we figured out that thinking long term and focusing on creating relationships for the long term is one thing that has helped us a lot. We are never focused in a very myopic way to think at a relationship and approach someone with what profits we are going to make in a quarter or this year or that year. But the most value add has been from relationships like these. And that’s how we started to back companies together. And that’s what equity investors today are just focusing on what the listed world is. And they will just go to a company and look at the revenue projection this and then invest. They don’t go behind the story. Going behind the story is where entrepreneurs come into picture where a leader in the space can guide you towards that, how he thinks about the business or some supplier or some value chain guy can tell you about what the credibility of that person is. And that we use a lot in the entrepreneur circle that we’ve built to frame that whether this company has a good future, has good relationships, has good ethics and has good culture or not, which in a way very few. If you look at any research note which is spanned out by, I mean you have 200 companies in India who do wealth management or there are maybe 500 brokers, all brokerage reports talk about this is the current market price, this is our target. I mean I in my journey have never been able to figure out how I can decide a target of a company because I just enter into from that learning experience that how this business is right now, what it can become few years down the line. And there’s a journey that we are going together with no target in mind. And that is what I guess investors should always look at: thinking long term, not having targets in mind, enjoying the journey and trying to figure out what they’re betting on, whom they’re betting on is the right person or not. And that has been again a theory that we have been being with Kimbal, being able to learn even more. That’s why I’m saying both side of the table have value added us a lot. Because before Kimbal we just used to think that we are in the right direction or not. After Kimbal we get this validation that yes, thinking about these things do matter. These are the things that we need to now incorporate more in our thesis when we are picking the next investment because we are wanting to add more value rather than just money. Betting on just stock prices is not what we want to stand for. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. ARVIND KOTHARI: That is what as a learning outcome I believe investors or even youngsters can have when they’re thinking about business relationships, about investing, about anything in their life. Thinking long term is one thing that I’ve learned from Buffett and Munger and which is a learning lesson for my life that I keep on wanting to explore more. ## Addressing the Smart Meter Controversy GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Understood. Ayush, the last question that I want to ask you is about the controversy about smart meters. And Teju just told me that there are people in Gujarat complaining that their bill was about 6,000 rupees and now it’s suddenly jumping up to 60,000 rupees. So that’s wild, right? And that defeats the purpose of having a smart meter which is to measure the power consumption accurately. So how do you respond to that? AYUSH SINHAL: See, couple of things. One, such a mass rollout of smart metering or a replacement drivers never happened in the world ever, right? In India we’re replacing 150,000 smart meters daily. So definitely there has been lot of challenges, there have been a lot of mistakes and every entity in this particular, every stakeholder in this particular game has learned from that. And today the solution has matured. Earlier there were so many cases that you were getting energy bill of different consumer. So there’s a meter number, there’s a serial number like 1, 2, 3 and your consumer number. Every accounting happens, every energy billing happens on your consumer number. Whereas the meter is sending data on 1, 2, 3 if the mapping is wrong. So you’ll be getting the energy bill of some other consumers and some other consumer will be getting a from someone else, right. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: So you think that the systems will get better with time. AYUSH SINHAL: Yes, the system is getting better with time. VIVEK JAIN: Right. AYUSH SINHAL: So the example that you’re giving us in Gujarat, what has happened initially was they as soon as the smart metering was implemented, they had added all the errors, all the previous undue charges into the smart metering account. At the first go itself, if you’re not able to pay that, then your electricity gets disconnected. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Got it. AYUSH SINHAL: So that, and it was just for around 1% or 2% of the consumer. But that 1% or 2% of the consumer spreads like anything, that message spreads like anything that after installing the smart meter, the bill inflates. Whereas the measurement is far better than previous one, so it is way more accurate, is way more secure. ## Final Words of Wisdom for Investors GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Understood. Vivek sir, do you have a final word to give out to the investors? VIVEK JAIN: Yeah. So in my learning and my experience, I’m sharing from the experience that you have to be patient. You have to look at the right space and be with the entrepreneur for some time. Give him the space. Any business has a sine wave kind of thing. It can go up and go down. Just do not see, okay, this quarter is bad, let’s exit. And also when an equity investor is listening to the con calls because a smaller investor may not have the ability to connect to the founder but he’s listening to con calls. Understand the tone behind it. The tone changes a lot as the company progresses. And if you’re right in there, you will make a hell lot of money. And as we told in the earlier thing also that money is the byproduct. The process should be right. Which is about the Gita also. Gita also talks about the same thing. Focus on the process, results will follow you. That’s what I believe. GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Thank you so much, sir. ARVIND KOTHARI: So. ## Recap and Key Takeaways GANESHPRASAD SRIDHARAN: Here’s a summary of our discussion today. Firstly, Arvind sir, you mentioned that we have three problems in India. Firstly, in spite of being the fifth largest producer of coal for the longest time we had been importing coal. Secondly, we also have T&D losses, transmission and distribution losses because of which we are losing out on a lot of money. And Ayush, you gave out a very simple analogy where you said that it’s almost like having a pipe full of water but having a massive leakage in between because of which you’re losing out on water and you’re suffering because of lack of water. That’s exactly what’s happening to India. And you mentioned we are losing 2% of our GDP worth of money into just T&D losses and energy losses which can be solved for. And lastly we spoke about the broken grid infrastructure. It’s broken because nobody anticipated the consumption of energy to go up so quickly. And because we are such a huge country, this is something that needs to be fixed. And the evolution is happening very, very quickly. Then we spoke about the supply chain of how power is produced and distributed. Where we spoke about how coal is sourced by Coal India then goes to power generation companies, then goes to power transmission companies, then goes to power distribution companies or discoms and then goes to the traders like Adani Power and Tata Power who then bring power to the households of India, to the industries of India. And here’s where we spoke about the inefficiency. The major inefficiency lies with the discoms because they’re incurring thousands of crores of losses. And one of the biggest reasons for that was T&D losses. And that is where you found an opportunity with smart meters. Like you mentioned, you are a usual hostile kid who did not bother to pay electricity bills, found a gap in the market, discovered that manually discoms had to send somebody to check the reading of your meter, find out if you paid the electricity bill or not. And they were being paid 10 rupees per meter which was nothing for doing something so tedious. And that is where you realized that there must be a smarter way to collect this data and fix this leakage in such a way that you can figure out how much power is being consumed, you can regulate the power consumption and most importantly, you can make this entire process efficient where if somebody is not paying the electricity bill, you can cut off the supply without practically sending someone all the way to your house. And that is where you found the opportunity with smart meters. ## The Solar Revolution and Smart Meters And what we also discussed, Arvind sir, is about the rise of solar. After PM Suryaghar Yojana, the solar revolution in India has picked up and that has also given an opportunity for the smart meter market. Because now we are transitioning from a grid infrastructure where electricity comes from one source to the hous",

    "full_text": "### Global Power Grid Failure: The Ultimate Test of a Disaster Economy ## The Unthinkable Scenario: A Worldwide Blackout Imagine waking up one morning to find every screen dark, every city silent, and every connection gone. No internet, no phone signal, no electricity — anywhere. Airports grounded. Hospitals dark. Satellites flickering. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the nightmare scenario energy planners call a \\*\\* [global grid failure](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=global+grid+failure&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549)\\*\\*. While localized outages are common, a systemic, cross-continental blackout would be unlike anything humanity has faced. It would disrupt water systems, banking, logistics, and communications in a single, cascading event. Within days, cities would struggle for food, fuel, and medical supplies. Within weeks, society would test the limits of order and survival. As impossible as it sounds, the risk isn’t zero. In an era of cyberwarfare, extreme [solar storms](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=solar+storms+electrical+grid&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), and geopolitical instability, experts are quietly asking a chilling question: What if the grid we depend on — globally — simply went dark? ## How the Power Grid Became the World’s Weakest Link The global electrical system was never designed as one coherent network. It’s a loose patchwork of regional grids — the U.S. Eastern, Western, and ERCOT systems, the European [ENTSO-E network](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=ENTSO-E+network&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), and massive interconnections across Asia. Each operates independently yet relies on the same fragile foundations: transmission lines, transformers, substations, and digital control systems. The more connected the world becomes, the more interdependent and vulnerable these systems grow. A cyberattack on one nation’s control nodes, a geomagnetic storm from the sun, or a chain-reaction equipment failure could disable multiple regions simultaneously. In the 21st century, electricity isn’t just energy — it’s existence. Food, transportation, defense, and finance all depend on uninterrupted power. The more sophisticated the grid, the more catastrophic its absence becomes. ## How a Global Grid Failure Could Happen Energy researchers identify three primary pathways for a worldwide electrical collapse: 1. **Cyberattack on control infrastructure:** The world’s grids are managed by industrial control systems (ICS) and [SCADA software](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=define+SCADA+software&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) — often decades old, insecure, and connected to the internet. Coordinated malware could disable protective relays and trip breakers across continents in seconds. 2. **Solar storm or electromagnetic pulse (EMP):** A strong coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun could induce geomagnetic currents that burn out transformers globally. The [1859 Carrington Event](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=1859+Carrington+Event&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) produced auroras as far south as Cuba — today, that same intensity could cripple satellites and transmission lines for years. 3. **Systemic equipment collapse:** With aging infrastructure, spare parts like high-voltage transformers take months to replace. A simultaneous series of failures across continents could outstrip manufacturing capacity and delay recovery indefinitely. Each scenario is improbable on its own — but together, they represent a plausible convergence risk in an age of climate stress, cyber conflict, and geopolitical fragmentation. ## The Domino Effect: 72 Hours to Chaos Most people underestimate how fast modern life unravels when electricity stops. Within hours, pumps at gas stations, water treatment plants, and supermarkets cease functioning. Hospitals switch to limited backup power. ATMs and credit systems go offline, halting commerce. By the third day, refrigerated food spoils, cell towers die, and transportation grinds to a halt. In dense urban areas, law enforcement becomes overwhelmed as communications fail and panic spreads. PowerPlantMaps’ research into past blackouts — from Texas 2021 to India’s 2012 outage affecting 620 million people — shows that even regional failures can paralyze entire economies. A global outage would multiply those effects a thousandfold. ## The Disaster Industrial Complex: Who Profits When the Lights Go Out? Ironically, every blackout fuels a surge of economic activity. Investors, insurers, and infrastructure firms stand ready to profit from reconstruction. Bloomberg estimates that U.S. disaster-related spending now exceeds \\*\\*$1 trillion annually\\*\\*, much of it directed toward energy restoration and backup systems. In this “ [disaster industrial complex](https://www.disasterreliefmaps.com/2025/10/the-rise-of-americas-disaster-economy.html),” every storm, fire, or grid failure becomes an opportunity — a market built on resilience, but driven by collapse. A global power failure would ignite the largest mobilization of resources in human history: satellite launches, microgrid installations, generator sales, and the reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Companies that build batteries, data centers, and private [microgrids](https://blog.solarenergymaps.com/2025/10/the-rise-of-microgrids-and-energy.html) could emerge as the next trillion-dollar winners. The question isn’t whether there will be profits — but who can survive long enough to earn them. ## What Would You Do Without Power? Preparedness experts categorize survival into five pillars: \\*\\*water, food, heat, communication, and mobility.\\*\\* A global outage would test all five simultaneously. - **Water:** Without electricity, municipal pumping stations fail. Gravity-fed systems run dry within days. Households would need stored water or filtration devices. - **Food:** Refrigeration halts and grocery supply chains collapse. Non-perishable goods and local agriculture become survival essentials. - **Heat and cooling:** In extreme climates, lack of HVAC can turn deadly within hours. Wood, propane, and solar heating become vital. - **Communication:** With no cellular or internet networks, shortwave and ham radios become the only long-range communication tools. - **Mobility:** Electric vehicles, gas pumps, and traffic systems stop. Bicycles and manually operated transport regain value. In essence, a total grid failure would revert modern life to the pre-industrial age — but with 8 billion people unprepared to live that way. ## Mapping the Impact: Where Blackouts Hit Hardest At [PowerPlantMaps.com](https://www.powerplantmaps.com), we use historical outage data to identify regions most vulnerable to cascading grid failures. The top risk clusters include: - **[U.S. Gulf Coast](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=US+Gulf+Coast+power+grid+resilience&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549):** Storm-driven outages and coastal grid fragility. - **Europe’s Rhine Corridor:** Flood-induced substation failures. - **South and East Asia:** Overloaded networks from rapid urbanization. - **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Chronic underinvestment and low redundancy. Visualizing these data layers reveals a pattern: the world’s most industrialized zones are also its most grid-dependent. The more developed the region, the steeper the fall when power vanishes. ## The Hidden Players of the Global Grid Few realize that a handful of corporations control the flow of global electricity hardware: [Siemens](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Siemens+electrical+grid+equipment&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549), ABB, Hitachi Energy, General Electric, and Schneider Electric manufacture most of the world’s high-voltage equipment. The supply chains for transformers, capacitors, and relays are so concentrated that a single global event could wipe out production capacity. In that case, rebuilding the world’s grid wouldn’t take months — it could take decades. This concentration of control turns grid resilience into both an engineering and geopolitical issue. ## The Rise of Microgrids and Energy Islands To prepare for the unthinkable, nations and cities are experimenting with \\*\\*microgrids\\*\\* — small, self-sufficient energy networks capable of operating independently from the main grid. Universities, hospitals, military bases, and even island nations are building localized systems powered by solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage. During a global grid crisis, these microgrids could form the backbone of recovery. They represent both a technological safeguard and a commercial gold rush: a new frontier in decentralized energy economics. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates over $50 billion in microgrid investment pipelines through 2030. The disaster industrial complex is already betting that the next generation of “resilience infrastructure” will come from these autonomous systems. ## Cybersecurity: The Invisible Battlefield In a hyperconnected world, power grids are no longer physical assets alone — they’re digital battlegrounds. State-sponsored hackers have targeted energy systems from Ukraine to the U.S. since 2015. A coordinated global cyberstrike could compromise grid stability faster than any storm. Governments and utilities now spend billions annually on cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and backup control centers. Yet even the most secure systems remain vulnerable to insider error, outdated software, and the sheer complexity of interconnected networks. In a global failure scenario, cyber resilience would be as important as physical repair. ## Rebuilding After the Global Blackout If a global power failure occurred, recovery would be uneven. Wealthier nations with manufacturing capacity could restore power in months, while others might remain dark for years. The United Nations and World Bank have already modeled post-catastrophe frameworks for global energy recovery — including emergency grids powered by floating nuclear reactors, airborne solar drones, and modular hydro plants. A global blackout could paradoxically accelerate renewable adoption as nations rebuild from scratch using distributed systems instead of centralized grids. In other words, from collapse could come reinvention — if humanity learns the right lessons. ## Personal and Community Resilience For individuals, preparedness is no longer paranoia; it’s prudence. A small investment in off-grid capacity — solar panels, portable batteries, [manual tools](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=manual+tools+survival&bbid=7683227091234190188&bpid=1924097696278016549) — can mean survival in prolonged outages. Communities can organize local power cooperatives, stockpile resources, and create neighborhood emergency protocols. On a larger scale, mapping and data transparency are essential. PowerPlantMaps encourages citizens to document blackouts, share outage data, and contribute to public resilience mapping. Knowledge is the first step toward preparedness. ## The Global Wake-Up Call A global grid failure may seem unlikely, but every regional blackout, cyber breach, or solar flare is a warning sign. Humanity’s greatest invention — the electric grid — is also its Achilles’ heel. The \\*\\*disaster industrial complex\\*\\* profits from repair, but resilience demands prevention. The choice facing governments and corporations is clear: invest now in modernization, or pay exponentially later in reconstruction. The world’s survival isn’t about avoiding the dark — it’s about learning how to rebuild the light.

This week, critical infrastructure breaches in Canada, a Swedish power grid operator breached, an Australian guilty of selling U.S. cyber exploits, Gmail wasn't breached, F5 projected a revenue dip, PhantomRaven campaign targeted developers, a Pakistan-linked actor targeted Indian government and Dentsu confirmed a data breach._ **See Also:** [AI vs. AI: Leveling the Defense Playing Field](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ai-vs-ai-leveling-defense-playing-field-a-28730?rf=RAM_SeeAlso) ### Hackers Probe Canadian Critical Infrastructure Hackers tampered with the pressure valves of a provincial water utility in a hack that degraded services, warned the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security in a Wednesday [alert](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts-advisories/al25-016-internet-accessible-industrial-control-systems-ics-abused-hacktivists). Water utilities - many of which are small, operate on a tight budget and aren't prepared to fend off hackers - have been a growing target for hackers (see: [_Weak and Exposed: US Water Utilities a Chinese Hacker Target_](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/weak-exposed-us-water-utilities-chinese-hacker-target-a-29743)). The advisory lists three recent incidents in which attackers remotely tampered with operational settings in industrial control systems, creating safety risks and service disruptions. In addition to the water utility, hackers triggered false alerts at an oil and gas company by manipulating an automated tank gauge. Another involved a grain drying silo, where temperature and humidity changes could have led to unsafe conditions, had they gone undetected. Authorities said the intrusions were opportunistic rather than coordinated, designed to attract media attention, erode public trust and harm Canada's reputation. While no catastrophic damage was reported, officials said industrial systems shouldn't be exposed. ### Sweden's Power Grid Operator Probes Data Breach Sweden's state-owned power grid operator, Svenska kraftnät, is [investigating](https://www.svk.se/press-och-nyheter/nyheter/allmanna-nyheter/2025/svenska-kraftnat-har-blivit-utsatta-for-ett-dataintrang/) a data breach after the ransomware group Everest claimed to have stolen 280 gigabytes of internal data and threatened to leak it. The company, which manages Sweden's electricity transmission system, said the incident involved a limited external file transfer solution and did not impact the country's power supply. Everest posted about the attack on its leak site over the weekend, warning it would publish the data if it doesn't receive an extortion payment. The Everest ransomware group has been active since 2020, engaging in data extortion and ransomware operations, along with initial access broker activity, [said](https://ismg-cdn.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/asset_files/external/hhs-hc3-everest-ransomware-threat-actor-profile-alert-8-20-24.pdf) the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center in a Tuesday advisory (see: [_US Authorities Warn Health Sector of Everest Gang Threats_](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/us-authorities-warn-health-sector-everest-gang-threats-a-26119)). ### Australian Pleads Guilty to Selling US Defense Trade Secrets to Russian Broker An Australian national pleaded [guilty](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-general-manager-us-defense-contractor-pleads-guilty-selling-stolen-trade-secrets) in a U.S. federal court to stealing cyber trade secrets from an American defense contractor and selling them to a Russian broker dealing in cybersecurity exploits. Peter Williams, 39, stole at least eight software exploit components tied to national security between April 2022 and June of this year, while employed at the unnamed company. Williams [entered](https://ismg-cdn.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/asset_files/external/usdc-united-states-vs-peter-williams-125-cr-00322-lla-oct-14-2025.pdf) written contracts with the Russian broker, agreeing to exchange the stolen data for cryptocurrency payments worth millions. He used encrypted channels to transfer the exploits and spent the proceeds on luxury goods and property. Williams pleaded guilty to two counts of theft of trade secrets, each carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Prosecutors also seek forfeiture of $1.3 million in assets, including jewelry, designer items and real estate, believed to be purchased with illicit funds. TechCrunch [reported](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/) that Williams was an executive at Trenchant, a division of L3Harris. Court documents suggest the buyer could be Operation Zero, a Russian zero-day broker known for offering multimillion-dollar bounties for mobile exploits. ### Gmail Breach Claims Are False Reports of a massive new Gmail data breach are vastly exaggerated - although analysis by Troy Hunt of a collection of stolen and breached emails put together by anti-fraud firm Synthient did reveal 16.4 million previously uncatalogued email addresses circulating in the cybercriminal underground. Google took to social media Monday to [debunk](https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/1982893232934793655) reports about a new Gmail breach affecting millions of users, calling them false. \"Gmail's defenses are strong, and users remain protected,\" read the post on X. Reports of a breach stem \"from a misunderstanding of infostealers. It's not reflective of a new attack aimed at any one person, tool, or platform,\" Google explained. What really happened was this: A Synthient researcher [compiled](https://synthient.com/blog/the-stealer-log-ecosystem) credentials stolen by infostealers, data-nabbing malware whose propagation is reaching epidemic proportions (see: [_Infostealers Run Wild_](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/infostealers-run-wild-a-29823)). The resulting dataset had 23 billion rows. Analysis by Have I Been Pwned founder Troy Hunt [identified](https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-synthient-threat-data) 183 million unique email addresses in the data, of which 16.4 million weren't already in Have I Been Pwned's extensive database of stolen or breached credentials. Of course, those 16.4 million addresses may have been fakes, but Hunt said that when he tried manually linking some of those new emails to real people, he found the path really did lead to actual humans. \"Time and time again, the data checked out, so we loaded it,\" he said. Threat actors routinely combine exposed credentials, collections that may contain data stretching back years that ping pong on cybercriminal channels - often generating credulous headlines about the size of the latest data breach. ### F5 Projects Revenue Dip Following Nation-State Hack Application security vendor F5 on Monday said a recent [nation-state breach](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/us-scrambles-to-patch-f5-amid-china-linked-breach-a-29759) is expected to affect its revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. \"F5 anticipates some near-term disruption to sales cycles as customers focus on assessing and remediating their environments following the recent security incident,\" the company said during a Monday earnings call. The company confirmed earlier this month that a nation-state attacker - later linked to China -maintained long-term access to its development systems, stealing source code and research related to the company's flagship BIG-IP product line. According to U.S. officials, an unknown number of federal networks were among those targeted in the aftermath of the breach. F5 first detected evidence of the intrusion in August. \"It was essentially BIG-IP customers that were impacted,\" F5 Chief Financial Officer Cooper Werner [told](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-f5-networks-q4-2025-beats-forecasts-stock-dips-93CH-4311984) investors. Data stolen by hackers \"impacted a small percentage of our customers,\" he added. F5 products are currently used by 85% of Fortune 500 companies, supporting 23,000 customers in over 170 different countries. Its stock price has fallen by roughly 14% in trading this week. ### 'PhantomRaven' Campaign Targets Developers With Malicious NPM Packages A large-scale supply chain attack dubbed PhantomRaven is targeting developers through malicious npm packages designed to steal authentication tokens, CI/CD secrets and GitHub credentials, [uncovered](https://www.koi.ai/blog/phantomraven-npm-malware-hidden-in-invisible-dependencies) Koi Security researchers. The campaign has been active since August and deployed 126 npm packages that collectively recorded over 86,000 downloads. Many of the packages imitate legitimate projects or were created through \"slopsquatting,\" where artificial intelligence assistants hallucinate non-existent but plausible package names during coding suggestions. Some malicious packages impersonate tools from GitLab and Apache, with several still available on npm. PhantomRaven packages exploit a remote dynamic dependencies technique, declaring no dependencies but fetching and executing payloads from external URLs during installation - all without user interaction. Once installed, the payload profiles the infected system, scans environment variables and exfiltrates data, including tokens from npm, GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins and CircleCI. These stolen credentials could enable further supply chain compromises. ### Dentsu Confirms Data Breach at US Subsidiary Merkle Japanese advertising giant Dentsu [confirmed](https://www.group.dentsu.com/jp/news/release/001551.html) a cybersecurity incident at its U.S.-based subsidiary, Merkle, which led to the theft of employee and client data. The company said it detected \"abnormal activity\" in part of Merkle's network. According to an internal memo [cited](https://www.decisionmarketing.co.uk/news/merkle-data-hit-as-dentsu-is-rocked-by-security-incident) by DecisionMarketing, the compromised information includes payroll information, bank details, salaries and contact information. Dentsu said the breach did not affect any systems based in Japan. ### Pakistan-Linked APT36 Targets Indian Government With New DeskRAT Malware A Pakistan-based threat actor tracked as Transparent Tribe and APT36 launched a new spear-phishing campaign targeting Indian government entities with a Golang-based remote access Trojan dubbed DeskRAT, [said](https://blog.sekoia.io/transparenttribe-targets-indian-military-organisations-with-deskrat/) cybersecurity firm Sekoia. Active during August and September, the operation builds on a similar campaign detailed by Cyfirma earlier this year. Hackers targeted Indian Linux-based operating system by tricking government employees into clicking malicious files that look like PDFs. When opened, the files install spyware, giving attackers long-term access to sensitive government systems (see: [_Transparent Tribe Deploys Malicious Files Against India Govt_](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/transparent-tribe-deploys-malicious-files-against-india-govt-a-29305)). The new campaign targets Boss Linux systems and establishes WebSocket-based command-and-control. It supports persistence through `system` services, `cron` jobs, `autostart` directories and `.bashrc` modifications. DeskRAT can browse files, collect and exfiltrate specific data, and deploy additional payloads. Researchers said the campaign's command and control \"stealth servers\" are hidden from public DNS records. A related campaign uncovered by QiAnXin XLab revealed StealthServer - a Windows variant of DeskRAT - featuring anti-analysis techniques, PowerShell-based persistence and TCP or WebSocket communications. Analysts said the campaigns reflect escalating cyber tensions in South Asia, with APT36 continuing to refine its cross-platform tools for intelligence collection and disruption. ### Other Stories From Last Week - [Securing EMV: 'More Is Less' for Security, Researchers Find](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/securing-emv-more-less-for-security-researchers-find-a-29876) - [OpenAI Restructures, Nonprofit Foundation Retains Control](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-restructures-nonprofit-foundation-retains-control-a-29870) - [Australia's Scam Prevention Framework: The Bubble That Burst](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/blogs/australias-scam-prevention-framework-bubble-that-burst-p-3965) - [US Withholds Support for UN Global Cybercrime Treaty](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/us-withholds-support-for-un-global-cybercrime-treaty-a-29878) - [Delmia Apriso Systems Under Attack](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/delmia-apriso-systems-under-attack-a-29871) _With reporting from Information Security Media Group's Gregory Sirico in New Jersey._ - [Cybercrime](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cybercrime-c-416) - [Cyberwarfare / Nation-State Attacks](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cyberwarfare-nation-state-attacks-c-420) - [Email Security & Protection](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/email-security-protection-c-583) - [Fraud Management & Cybercrime](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/fraud-management-cybercrime-c-409) - [Governance & Risk Management](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/governance-risk-management-c-93) - [Operational Technology (OT)](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/operational-technology-ot-c-599) - [Credit Eligible](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/premium/pricing) - Get Permission [PreviousCryptohack Roundup: Allegations Involving Melania Memecoins](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cryptohack-roundup-allegations-involving-melania-memecoins-a-29889) [Next Sublime Secures $150M to Advance Agentic Email Protection](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/sublime-secures-150m-to-advance-agentic-email-protection-a-29891) #### About the Author #### [Anviksha More](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/authors/anviksha-more-i-5461) _Senior Editor, APAC, ISMG_ More has seven years of experience in journalism, writing and editing.

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

Mosque demolitions, communal violence and a precarious religious landscape ![](https://www.intelligencefusion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC08175-scaled.jpg) Oscar Smith Regional Intelligence Analyst From the consecration of the Ram Mandir to the demolition of mosques, the religious landscape of India is undergoing seismic shifts, stirring communal tensions and political upheaval. This blog examines the ramifications of recent developments and anticipates the road ahead in Indian politics, communal relations - and potential violence. ## Executive Summary - Hindu religious processions have been affected by disruptive action. - Demolitions of Islamic religious sites in other areas have sparked riots. - Attacks on processions have been small-scale, but Haldwani riots show potential for escalation. - The Ram Mandir consecration is tied to Indian politics, and communal tensions are high leading into the 2024 General Election. ![communal violence religious festivities indian politics](https://www.intelligencefusion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Picture12.png) ## Background The site of the Babri Masjid (demolished in 1992) in Ayodhya has been a politically charged issue in Indian politics for years. The construction of a Mandir on the former site of the Masjid has long been a totemic issue for Hindu nationalist parties, such as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and in 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of the construction of a Mandir on the site. On the 22nd January 2024, the Ram Mandir was consecrated in a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While the publicity of the consecration ceremony could be seen as a move to energise the BJP base for the upcoming general election, it can also be argued to have increased tensions between Hindu and Muslim communities, primarily in northern states such as Gujarat, Utter Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Low-level incidents of communal violence followed the consecration, with Hindu religious processions being targeted. These attacks are generally not complex or impactful, with a small number of people wounded. However, a [larger riot](https://news.abplive.com/states/up-uk/violence-erupts-in-banbhoolpura-haldwani-during-anti-encroachment-drive-curfew-imposed-shoot-on-sight-order-issued-1662955) following the demolition of a Mosque in Haldwani indicates that there is now an especially charged environment surrounding Mosque demolitions and that there exists the possibility for escalation in the future. Smaller demonstrations and religiously charged assaults also indicate that such escalation may occur without explicit connections to political parties or religious movements. ![social unrest Indian politics](https://www.intelligencefusion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Picture13.png) ## What has happened? Attacks on religious processions in the days leading up to and following the consecration were recorded in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, with an attack in Kheralu developing into [a clash with the police](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/teargas-lobbed-stones-thrown-on-procession/articleshow/107039925.cms) in which at least three people were wounded. The attacks are not reported to have involved firearms or led to fatalities. In the Kheralu incident, as well as similar procession attacks in the [Padra area of Gujarat](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/villagers-clash-after-stone-pelted-at-ram-temple-shobha-yatra-in-padra-9122301/) and the [Mira Bhayandar area of Maharashtra](https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/mumbai/story/communal-clash-breaks-out-near-mumbai-ahead-of-ram-mandir-consecration-event-2491943-2024-01-22), the affected processions were being held by followers of Ram, the Hindu god central to the Ram Mandir. The affected states were primarily northern, and similar violence was not reported in southern states such as Karnataka, where rallies were forbidden in the period surrounding the consecration. Smaller acts of violence with low impact were still reported in southern states, as Karnataka saw a demonstration calling for the imprisonment of a Muslim who had posted material online that was critical of the Ram Mandir, and a religiously-motivated assault on a taxi driver in Maharashtra was reported following the consecration. Two Mosques are known to have been demolished in the period following the consecration, [one in Delhi](https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/delhi/story/centuries-old-mosque-razed-delhi-amid-encroachment-drive-2498115-2024-02-06) and [one in Haldwani](https://5pillarsuk.com/2024/02/15/haldwani-muslims-live-in-fear-after-india-mosque-demolition/), both officially under the auspices of an ‘anti-encroachment drive.’ The demolition of the Mosque and connected Madrasa in Haldwani notably sparked a riot on the 8th of February 2024 in which at least four people were killed and over a hundred people wounded. The riot led to the government of Uttarakhand declaring a curfew in the affected areas and issuing a shoot-on-sight order to the police. The Haldwani riot is the most notable incident of communal violence to have immediately followed the Ram Mandir consecration. The nature of the low-level attacks and the riots indicates that violence along religious lines can flare up and escalate suddenly and violently but is more likely to do so in areas with an inciting factor, such as religious processions or Mosque demolitions. ![communal violence Indian politics](https://www.intelligencefusion.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Picture14.png) ## What next? The Indian general election is to be held from 19th April to 1st June 2024. With this in mind, communal and religious tensions could play strongly into Indian politics over the coming weeks and months, with the consecration and, to a lesser extent, the moves to demolish local Mosques both likely to energise Hindu nationalist and Hindutva politics. Even if no further demolitions occur in this period, there is an elevated risk of election-related violence and low-level attacks on Hindu religious processions. Processions and events related to the worship of Ram should be considered especially at-risk. Demonstrations and acts of vigilantism from both Hindu and Islamic religious communities are also a strong possibility. Demolitions for various reasons are likely to continue; as of the time of this writing, another Mosque, the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in Delhi, has been scheduled for demolition. Officially, the Sunehri Bagh site is being demolished to ease traffic congestion. However, it is likely that more politically charged narratives will dominate the discussion surrounding the demolition. As the violence in Haldwani demonstrates, responses to Mosque demolitions can escalate to violence suddenly. It is also possible that low-level incidents of communal violence may provoke a similar escalation. * * * ### On the Intelligence Fusion platform, we have mapped 853 incidents in India so far this year, of which 449 are categorised as criminality, and 102 are categorised as protests.

The NCSC said it will open multiple centers allowing allow low-technology vendors to independently audit their IT infrastructure. The initiative will also adopt a new assurance methodology, different from existing regulatory requirements, the agency added. \"Through testing their response to simulated cyberattacks, the UK's most critical infrastructure will be further empowered to defend against evolving online threats,\" said Jonathon Ellison, NCSC director for national resilience. ### Grid Operators Rule out Cyberattack in Iberian Blackout A massive April 28 power outage [plunged](https://www.wired.com/gallery/europes-devastating-power-outage-in-photos/) Spain and Portugal into darkness, disrupting transportation, telecommunications and essential services in some places for up to 24 hours. Grid operators in both countries have ruled out cyberattacks as the cause, attributing the blackout to sudden energy losses and grid instability. \"There was no type of intrusion whatsoever in the control systems that might have caused the incident,\" a top executive of Spanish electricity provider Red Eléctrica [told](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20250429/apagon-electrico-espana-red-electrica-ciberataque/16558726.shtml) reporters. Despite these assessments, political leaders were unable to fully leave behind the prospect of a cyberattack. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez repeated several times since the outage that he has not discarded the possibility of a cyberattack. Spanish newspaper El Independiente on Tuesday [reported](https://www.elindependiente.com/espana/2025/05/06/la-falta-de-reivindicacion-desinfla-la-tesis-del-ciberataque-en-el-apagon/) that self-styled hacktivists Dark Storm Team, along with NoName057, claimed that day to have cut electricity in some NATO countries, an assertion that cybersecurity experts treat with skepticism. Spain's high court [opened an investigation](https://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Audiencia-Nacional/Noticias-Judiciales/La-Audiencia-Nacional-abre-diligencias-para-investigar-si-el-apagon-en-toda-Espana-fue-un-sabotaje-informatico) on April 29. ### India and Pakistan Publish Dueling Cybersecurity Advisories Rising tensions between India and Pakistan resulted in dueling cybersecurity advisories from each side of the Kashmiri border. India launched military strikes against Pakistan on Wednesday, targeting what it said was \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistan. The operation followed an April 22 attack that killed 26 people in a popular vacation spot in Indian-administered Kashmir. India said the attacks are linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba, Islamist militants based in Pakistan. Indian stock exchange BSE warned firms to beef up cyber defenses, urging \"precautionary measures on potential cyber risks including high-impact cyberattacks such as ransomware, supply chain intrusions, DDoS attacks, website defacement and malware,\" a widely reported Thursday circular stated. The National Cyber Emergency Response Team of Pakistan [published](https://ismg-cdn.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/asset_files/external/22.pdf) a \"high priority advisory in response to an escalating border situation with a neighboring country.\" The CERT asserted that adversaries are launching \"sophisticated cyberattacks\" against critical networks, advising vigilance against phishing attacks, clicking strange links and scanning unknown QR codes. India and Pakistan have gone to war three times since separating in 1947 following independence from Great Britain. The two countries have additionally fought dozens of skirmishes over the status of Kashmir, a Muslim-majority Himalayan region under the control of both governments. ### Delta Faces Lawsuit Over Massive Flight Disruptions Linked to CrowdStrike Outage A proposed class action lawsuit against Delta over delayed or canceled flights last July due to a botched update by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike mainly survived an attempt by the Atlanta airliner to have it dismissed in court. U.S. District for the District of Northern Georgia Judge Mark Cohen [ruled](https://ismg-cdn.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/asset_files/external/govuscourtsgand332536600.pdf) that five out of nine plaintiffs can pursue breach of contract claims against Delta, which canceled approximately 7,000 flights during the incident. The airliner estimates the outage resulted in $500 million in lost revenue and additional costs. A group of five plaintiffs can proceed with claims under the [Montreal Convention](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/mc99/), an international treaty governing airline liability. Delta itself is suing CrowsStrike over the incident, filing a complaint in Georgia superior court invoking Georgia state anti-hacking statute to accuse the cybersecurity firm of \"installing an exploit in Delta systems\" by automatically rolling out an update affecting the Windows operating system kernel (See: [_Delta Air Lines Sues CrowdStrike Over July System Meltdown_](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/delta-air-lines-sues-crowdstrike-over-july-system-meltdown-a-26649)). ### Mirai Botnet Exploits Flaws in GeoVision, Samsung IoT Devices Hackers are exploiting vulnerabilities in end-of-life GeoVision IoT devices and Samsung’s MagicINFO server to expand the Mirai botnet, according to research from [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/active-exploitation-mirai-geovision-iot-botnet), [Arctic Wolf](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/cve-2024-7399/) and [Huntress](https://www.huntress.com/blog/rapid-response-samsung-magicinfo9-server-flaw). Akamai observed attacks in April targeting GeoVision devices through two OS command injection flaws - [CVE-2024-6047](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6047) and [CVE-2024-11120](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11120) \\- to download and run an ARM variant of Mirai dubbed LZRD. The botnet abuses the `/DateSetting.cgi` endpoint to inject commands through the `szSrvIpAddr` parameter. Other vulnerabilities include exploits of older bugs in Hadoop yarn, [CVE-2018-10561](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2018-10561), and DigiEver systems. The campaign appears linked to a group known as \"InfectedSlurs.\" Arctic Wolf reported active exploitation of [CVE-2024-7399](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7399) in Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server, a path traversal flaw enabling attackers to write arbitrary files and execute code via crafted JSP files. Samsung patched the issue in August 2024 but Huntress found the latest version still to be vulnerable. With many affected GeoVision devices no longer supported, experts urge users to upgrade hardware. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/05/07/cisa-adds-two-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) the GeoVision flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, mandating mitigation or device decommissioning by May 28. ### New Chinese Smishing Kit 'Panda Shop' Targets Global Users A China-based cybercriminal group developed a smishing toolkit named \"Panda Shop,\" facilitating widespread phishing attacks via iMessage, [uncovered](https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/smishing-massive-scale-panda-shop-chinese-carding-syndicate) researchers at Resecurity. The kit enables attackers to impersonate postal and delivery services, including India Post, USPS and Royal Mail, to deceive users into revealing personal and financial information. By exploiting compromised Apple iCloud accounts, the group sends fraudulent messages containing malicious links that direct recipients to counterfeit websites. These sites prompt victims to input sensitive data under the guise of package delivery updates. The Panda Shop kit is distributed through Telegram channels. Researchers identified vulnerabilities within the kit, enabling them to access data from over 108,000 victims. ### Other Stories from Last Week - [CrowdStrike Lays Off 500 Workers as AI Flattens Hiring Curve](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/crowdstrike-lays-off-500-workers-as-ai-flattens-hiring-curve-a-28340) - [OpenAI to Retain Nonprofit Oversight Amid For-Profit Shift](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-to-retain-nonprofit-oversight-amid-for-profit-shift-a-28290) - [Hacker Exploits AI Art Tool to Steal 1.1TB of Disney Data](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/hacker-exploits-ai-art-tool-to-steal-11tb-disney-data-a-28343) - [Jailbreakers Use Invisible Characters to Beat AI Guardrails](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/jailbreakers-use-invisible-characters-to-beat-ai-guardrails-a-28338) - [Poland Busts 4 as Part of Stresser/Booter Service Crackdown](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/poland-busts-4-as-part-stresserbooter-service-crackdown-a-28325) _With reporting from Information Security Media Group's Akshaya Asokan in Manchester, United Kingdom and David Perera in Northern Virginia._ - [Cybercrime](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cybercrime-c-416) - [Fraud Management & Cybercrime](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/fraud-management-cybercrime-c-409) - [Incident & Breach Response](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/incident-breach-response-c-40) - [Security Operations](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/security-operations-c-444) - [Credit Eligible](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/premium/pricing) - Get Permission [PreviousWatchGuard Snags Ex-SentinelOne COO Srivatsan as Interim CEO](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/watchguard-snags-ex-sentinelone-coo-srivatsan-as-interim-ceo-a-28355) [Next India Tells Financial Sector to Strengthen Cyber Defenses](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/india-tells-financial-sector-to-strengthen-cyber-defenses-a-28357) #### About the Author #### [Anviksha More](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/authors/anviksha-more-i-5461) _Senior Editor, APAC, ISMG_ More has seven years of experience in journalism, writing and editing.

What the breach of cybersecurity firm KnownSec revealed # Did China access Indian immigration and border data? What the breach of cybersecurity firm KnownSec revealed Edited By[Vinod Janardhanan](https://www.wionews.com/author/vinod-janardhanan) Published: Nov 13, 2025, 12:31 IST \\| Updated: Nov 13, 2025, 12:31 IST ## Reperesntative image of a hacker and the logo of KnownSec are shown in this combo image **Photograph: (Others)** Story highlights ## A major data breach at Chinese firm KnownSec is giving a glimpse into how China is spying on Asian rivals including India using cyber tools. Besides several hacking programmes, state-linked cyber operations across more than 20 nations were revealed. One of China’s most important cybersecurity firms has been breached, revealing information about India stored on its servers. The hack revealed that KnownSec had data on the immigration records of India. The incident, which came to light earlier this month, exposed files that reportedly included details of state-aligned hacking operations across more than 20 countries. As per cyber security experts, the data is a rare glimpse into China's offensive cyber capabilities and the role of private firms in state-directed operations. ## KnownSec breach: What was leaked? The breach reportedly involved the leak of over 12,000 internal documents from KnownSec’s secure servers. It contained blueprints and source code for advanced malware, remote access tools and device-based attack kits, according to cybersecurity analysts. It allegedly included programmes that can access chat histories from WeChat, QQ and Telegram. There were also hardware implants disguised as USB chargers, such as malicious power banks. The files, released on the web, contained lists of targets spanning Asia, Europe and Africa, with India, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the UK featuring prominently. Add WION as a Preferred Source The files were briefly shared on GitHub before being taken down, but copies have since circulated among security researchers and dark web forums.

It allegedly contained archives of Indian immigration data and digital infrastructure maps. One spreadsheet allegedly contained records of 95 gigabytes of Indian immigration data, possibly stolen in 2024. Security analysts who examined the breach found that China had a long-term interest in Indian government networks and border systems. ## What is KnownSec? Founded in 2007, KnownSec is a private cybersecurity firm known to have collaborated with Chinese government agencies on digital defence projects. Deeply embedded in national cyber initiatives, KnownSec’s well-known products include the ZoomEye internet scanning engine, used for network reconnaissance. In January this year, the US Department of Defence blacklisted dozens of Chinese companies operating in the US that it claimed are part of the People’s Republic of China’s military apparatus. KnownSec, formally known as Beijing Zhidao Chuangyu Information Technology Co., Ltd, was one of them.

Instead, it may have been an insider job or the work of an ideological actor. China has not officially acknowledged the breach, calling reports “groundless”, and KnownSec has issued no public statement. Leaked internal memos circulating online hinted at internal containment efforts by the company. Cybersecurity analysts warned that the exposure could have lasting effects, as the files could be repurposed by criminal or state groups. For India, the leas show the need for stronger cyber defence. ## Related Stories - [**China Blames U.S. for $13 Billion Bitcoin Heist \\| ‘State-Level Hack,’ Says Beijing**](https://www.wionews.com/videos/china-blames-u-s-for-13-billion-bitcoin-heist-state-level-hack-says-beijing-1762973624967) - [**UK Plans Tougher Cyber Security Laws \\| Govt Moves to Protect Public Services from Cyberattacks**](https://www.wionews.com/videos/uk-plans-tougher-cyber-security-laws-govt-moves-to-protect-public-services-from-cyberattacks-1762942097936) - [**China accuses US of $14 billion Bitcoin theft: How is LuBian hack linked to 'pig butchering scam' and Chen Zhi?**](https://www.wionews.com/world/china-accuses-us-of-14-billion-bitcoin-theft-how-is-lubian-hack-linked-to-pig-butchering-scam-and-chen-zhi-1762932085945) - [**Anupama Parameswaran files cyber-crime complaint against 20-year-old woman; know why**](https://www.wionews.com/entertainment/anupama-parameswaran-files-cyber-crime-complaint-against-20-year-old-woman-know-why-1762673103332) - [**Anupama Parameswaran files cyber-crime complaint against 20-year-old woman; know why**](https://www.wionews.com/entertainment/anupama-parameswaran-files-cyber-crime-complaint-against-20-year-old-woman-know-why-1762673103332) - [**Nikkei Hit by Major Cyberattack After Employee Error \\| 17,000 Records Exposed in Slack Breach**](https://www.wionews.com/videos/nikkei-hit-by-major-cyberattack-after-employee-error-17-000-records-exposed-in-slack-breach-1762348981256) - [**British clothes company Marks and Spencer's profits plummet due to cyberattack**](https://www.wionews.com/business-economy/british-clothes-company-marks-and-spencer-s-profits-plummet-due-to-cyberattack-1762346526023) - [**India-Israel: Israel FM Concludes Two-Day India Visit, Calls India A 'Special Country'**](https://www.wionews.com/videos/india-israel-israel-fm-concludes-two-day-india-visit-calls-india-a-special-country-1762328284738) - [**Israel's FM Gideon Sa’ar hopes direct flight with India will be restarted**](https://www.wionews.com/world/israel-s-fm-gideon-sa-ar-hopes-direct-flight-with-india-will-be-restarted-1762278147392) - [**US Cyber Experts Charged for Running Massive Ransomware Scheme**](https://www.wionews.com/videos/us-cyber-experts-charged-for-running-massive-ransomware-scheme-1762250877423) ### About the Author ### [Vinod Janardhanan](https://www.wionews.com/author/vinod-janardhanan) ### [Vinod Janardhanan](https://www.wionews.com/author/vinod-janardhanan) Vinod Janardhanan, PhD writes on international affairs, defence, Indian news, entertainment and technology and business with special focus on artificial intelligence.

    "full_text": "### BW Communities # India Faces Highest Ransomware Threat In APJ Region: CrowdStrike Report [BW Online Bureau](javascript:void(0);) Oct 21, 2025 - [\\# Ransomware](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/ransomware) - [\\# India](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/india) - [\\# Cyberattack](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cyberattack) - [\\# Cybersecurity](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/cybersecurity) - [\\# APJ](https://www.businessworld.in/tag/apj) Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. CPI-Maoist and all other Naxal groups are designated as terrorist organizations. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States. The affected States have approached the insurgency with a mixture of policies including negotiation, development programs, and security programs. The Center government has also instituted programs to assist affected states, primarily through funding State programs.

It provides background on the Northern Regional Grid, including its generation sources and transmission network. On January 2nd, several transmission lines experienced faults which were not successfully isolated. This led to an imbalance between generation and load. Frequency rose above safe levels, triggering more protective relays and causing a cascading outage across seven states in the region lasting around 16 hours.

Over the years, the LAC has sparked standoffs, skirmishes and war between the two expanding nuclear powers. To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. Despite their enduring differences, India and China largely have managed to keep their border disputes from spilling over into other aspects of their relationship, such as trade. But that may start to change. As China forges deeper ties with India's nuclear archrival, Pakistan, and as each...",

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Half of the world's container ship traffic passes through the Indian Ocean, where China is challenging India's dominance. (SAM PANTHAKY/AFP/Getty Images) ## Highlights - _China's increased presence in the Indian Ocean is driving India into a race for dominance in the region._ - _India's broad security commitments prevent it from meeting its naval ambitions, forcing it to rely on other strategic measures to challenge China's penetration into the region._ - _By taking advantage of geographic choke points, building up its influence with states inside and outside the region, and seeking closer cooperation with the United States, India is positioning itself to better challenge China in the Indian Ocean._ Throughout most of India's history, its rulers have emphasized land forces over sea power. Their domains were faced with the persistent threat of invasion from the northwest as well as the specter of internal strife. But the European colonial invasions by sea provided a rude awakening, and in the immediate aftermath of independence, New Delhi focused on the need for a powerful navy. However, conflict with Pakistan, internal dissent and border clashes with China reinforced the need for powerful ground forces. And China isn't just testing India on the land; it is also pushing into the Indian Ocean. To meet this challenge, India is strengthening its navy while maximizing its strategic thinking....

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government's announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture.

India can generate renewable power, but without urgent upgrades to storage and transmission infrastructure, its clean energy ambitions risk stalling at a critical moment [Himanshu Ojha](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/himanshu-ojha) Updated on: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm Updated on: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm [SUBSCRIBE](https://subscriptions.outlookbusiness.com/default?_gl=1*xh9irm*_gcl_au*NDczNjgzMjM0LjE3NTEyOTMzMDQ.*_ga*MTcwMTQwMzY0MS4xNzQzNjkwODUw*_ga_EQ1QWF0GDN*czE3NTI2NzA2ODQkbzE1JGcwJHQxNzUyNjcwNjg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMjA0NDU4MDI1Mg..&userId=62f0aa5bcec7e365f6491e6d&referrarData=eyJ1c2VyU291cmNlRGF0YSI6Ik9USEVSUyIsInJlZmVycmVyIjoib3V0bG9va2J1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyZXJVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRsb29rYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tLyJ9) Electricity Grid Electricity Grid Summary of this article - **Generation Outpaces Grid:** Over 50 GW of renewable capacity remains stranded due to inadequate transmission and delayed PPAs, despite India’s strong progress in clean energy generation. - **Transmission Bottlenecks:** Annual transmission expansion lags 40% behind targets, hindered by slow clearances, fragmented planning, and the geographical mismatch between generation and demand centres. - **Storage Shortfall:** India has just 205 MW of battery storage against a projected need of 411 GWh by 2032, making it impossible to shift surplus solar power to evening hours. - **Urgent Reforms Needed:** Achieving the 500 GW goal will require faster project clearances, coordinated Centre-state planning, and massive investments in both grid and storage infrastructure. India made impressive strides in renewable energy in recent years, with record capacity additions in recent years. However, the country’s power- transmission network has struggled to keep pace, leading to a clear gap between the generation and the evacuation infrastructure. The result? Over 50 GW of renewable energy capacity, enough to provide clean energy to 80-85 million households, cannot start operations and an extra 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide is being released daily into the atmosphere, all due to the lack of power cables and delays in the signing of power purchase agreements. [Follow our WhatsApp channel](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaFex3u0gcfHwT13lj1d) **The Ambition** Lapses on the transmission side can not only impact the environment and economic development, but also derail the country’s energy transition strategy. During the COP26 summit in 2021, India committed to installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel based power capacity by 2030, with solar energy contributing the largest share at 280 GW, followed by 140 GW from wind power, with hydropower, bioenergy, and nuclear energy chipping in with the rest. So far, India’s progress has been significant. According to the latest data from Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India’s non-fossil fuel capacity currently stands at 256 GW and is expected to reach around 300 GW soon, with over 40 GW of renewable energy projects in advanced stages such as signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and securing transmission connectivity. Among the key drivers for this clean revolution have been advances in technology and scale that have helped drive down costs. “The cost of installing panels whether on rooftops or utility-scale plants has fallen dramatically over the years,” points out Gaurav Upadhyay, Energy Finance Specialist at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). However, going forward, even the government acknowledges that maintaining this pace of growth will require an amended playbook. “In the last decade, India’s renewable energy capacity has grown more than fivefold, from under 35 GW in 2014 to over 197 GW (excluding large hydro) today. The next leap requires not just more megawatts, but deeper system reforms,” the MNRE Ministry said in a press statement this month. The challenges related to the transmission network stem from essentially three sources — delayed execution, fragmented planning and the fluctuating nature of renewable power generation. First, let us look at the last element — the fluctuating nature of power generation from renewable sources. [Govt Ramps Up Transmission Infra Construction to Meet India’s Growing Green Energy Demand](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/govt-ramps-up-transmission-infra-construction-to-meet-indias-growing-green-energy-demand) BY [Outlook Business Desk](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/outlook-business-desk) **Grid Under Pressure** Designers of power transmission grids have always taken into account the need for a certain level of over capacity. This is because the demand for power varies significantly by the time of the day, and even season. For example, a grid catering primarily to a residential population may see peak demand in the evenings and summers, while an industrial area may see peak demand during day time. While historically, this cycle has primarily been demand led, the rise of renewables has led to the emergence of supply led fluctuations as renewables do not produce electricity at a uniform, or even predictable, pattern. Hence, on the days of high solar output, producers are often forced to curtail generation, leading to wasted energy and losses for developers. On the other hand, output can drop significantly on cloudy or rainy days, leading to underutilization of the grid and undersupply. Similar fluctuations are also seen on the grids connected to wind farms, with the variations connected to atmospheric conditions rather than insolation. According to Mercom Clean Energy Insights, since March 2025, nearly 4 GW of Wind-solar energy has been curtailed only in Rajasthan due to delays in transmission projects and lower power demand due to above-normal rainfall this year. It is therefore not surprising that India’s electricity grid infrastructure, designed decades ago for the steady supply generated by coal-based thermal power plants, is struggling to accommodate the variable and intermittent nature of renewable energy. A significant portion of renewable power often goes unused due to transmission bottlenecks and fluctuating demand, pointed out Upadhyay. “This oversupply has even driven daytime spot market prices into negative. India needs to ramp up its energy storage so excess solar power generated during the day can be stored and used later,” he added. Nikhil Nahar, Co-founder of SolarSquare, pointed out that operating a grid in today’s times has become far more complicated than it was in an era of predictable generation and demand, leading to the need for more sophisticated designs and advanced grid management tools. “This intermittency demands real-time balancing, flexible generation sources, and advanced forecasting tools—areas where India’s grid still lacks depth,” he noted. Compounding the challenge is the geographical mismatch between generation and demand. Much of India’s renewable energy is being generated in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, far from industrial demand centres such as Maharashtra, Delhi, and Karnataka. The mismatch between where power is produced and where it is consumed, which leads to evacuation difficulties, has become one of the most serious structural challenges in India’s energy transition. “Several auctioned renewable projects remain stranded as PPAs stall and transmission lags especially in Rajasthan and Gujarat, where 8-11 GW is stuck,” Upadhyay noted. **The Infrastructure Gap: Transmission and Storage** The second factor behind the grid’s inability to support the growth of renewable power is a lack of investment, giving rise to a widening infrastructure gap between the pace of renewable capacity additions and the development of supporting transmission and storage systems. Despite increased private sector participation under Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding, India’s overall transmission expansion has been slow and remains below National Electricity Policy targets. Annual transmission line additions have fallen short of planned levels since FY2019, with only FY2021 surpassing expectations. According to the recent _Transmission expansion trails renewable energy growth in India_ report by IEEFA and JMK Research: “In FY2025, 8,830 circuit kilometres (ckm) of new transmission lines were commissioned against a target of 15,253 ckm, representing a 42% gap, with Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) additions at their lowest in a decade.” “The challenge begins right from the planning stage of a transmission project,” said Vishal Tripathi, Former Public Policy Expert at NITI Aayog. “These assets often have to pass through forest areas, defence land, agricultural zones and commercial properties, each requiring multiple clearances and permissions from different authorities.” However, transmission is only part of the puzzle. The intermittency of renewables means that to complete the transition, the grid must be connected with energy storage facilities. However, this is also an area which is at its infancy in India. The country’s current installed capacity of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is at just 205 MW whereas, according to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates, the country will need 411.4 Gigawatt-hour (GWh) of energy storage systems by 2031-32. Of this, around – 236.2GWh, is expected to come from battery energy storage systems (BESS) and the remaining 175.2 GWh from pumped-hydro storage plants. Upadhyay of IEEFA points out that we cannot move away from our reliance on thermal plants until we get this part of the puzzle right. “We don’t yet have enough storage to shift daytime solar power to evening hours.” [About 48 GW Inter-State Transmission System Network Completed for RE Evacuation: Govt](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/economy-and-policy/about-48-gw-inter-state-transmission-system-network-completed-for-re-evacuation-govt) BY [PTI](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/pti) **Policy and Institutional Bottlenecks** The third element hampering the growth of transmission capacity in India is gaps in planning. The CEA, the central government agency in charge of transmission, has prepared a detailed National Electricity Plan (Transmission) to build up 500 GW of renewable energy transmission capacity by the year 2030 and 600 GW by 2032. According to the plan, over 1.91 lakh ckm of transmission lines and 1,270 GVA of transformation capacity is planned to be added during the ten year period from 2022-23 to 2031-32 (at 220 kV and above voltage level). In addition, the inter-regional transmission capacity is planned to increase to 143 GW by the year 2027 and further to 168 GW by the year 2032, from the present level of 119 GW. However, what the plan fails to address is the key question of who will invest in these inter-state transmission networks. If the responsibility falls largely on DISCOMs, that would create major problems, because most of them are already under severe financial stress. By 2023–24, their cumulative losses had reached nearly ₹6.9 lakh crore, while their outstanding debt stood at around ₹6.8 trillion. “Power distribution companies need sufficient funds to ensure smooth operations and capital investment. Without sufficient financial resources, the reliability of power system is compromised,” said Karn Pallav, Head –Regulatory Affairs, BSES Rajdhani Power. [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) BY [Outlook Planet Desk](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/author/outlook-planet-desk) Today, the situation is such that even if India installs 500 GW of renewable capacity, it won’t be able to transmit all the power where it is needed. Bridging this gap will demand unprecedented coordination between the Centre and the states, faster clearances for transmission projects, and a massive push to develop storage infrastructure. Some of the initiatives that can help in addressing the gap include a single-window clearance system to streamline approvals for land acquisition, right-of-way and grid connectivity, performance-linked incentives and disincentives based on asset utilisation and asset monetisation and public-private partnerships. In addition, the country has to set up massive energy storage systems in renewable-rich regions such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu and co-locate solar and wind plants with such systems. India's clean energy transition now hinges less on generation and more on storage and transmission. Without swift action, we risk derailing the green transition of the world's fastest-growing economy. ##### Related Content [L&T's Power Transmission & Distribution Vertical Bags Grid Infrastructure Orders in Middle East](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/lts-power-transmission-distribution-vertical-bags-grid-infrastructure-orders-in-middle-east) [Sembcorp to Acquire 100% Stake in ReNew Sun Bright for about ₹1,700 Cr](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/sembcorp-to-acquire-100-stake-in-renew-sun-bright-for-about-1700-cr) [Why Coal Continues to Rule the Grid](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/why-coal-continues-to-rule-the-grid) [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) ##### Related Content [L&T's Power Transmission & Distribution Vertical Bags Grid Infrastructure Orders in Middle East](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/lts-power-transmission-distribution-vertical-bags-grid-infrastructure-orders-in-middle-east) [Sembcorp to Acquire 100% Stake in ReNew Sun Bright for about ₹1,700 Cr](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/corporate/sembcorp-to-acquire-100-stake-in-renew-sun-bright-for-about-1700-cr) [Why Coal Continues to Rule the Grid](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/why-coal-continues-to-rule-the-grid) [India Cancels Grid Access for 17 GW Renewable Projects as Demand Soars — Here’s Why](https://www.outlookbusiness.com/planet/industry/india-cancels-grid-access-17gw-renewable-projects) Published At: 28 October 2025 6:16 pm [SUBSCRIBE](https://subscriptions.outlookbusiness.com/default?_gl=1*xh9irm*_gcl_au*NDczNjgzMjM0LjE3NTEyOTMzMDQ.*_ga*MTcwMTQwMzY0MS4xNzQzNjkwODUw*_ga_EQ1QWF0GDN*czE3NTI2NzA2ODQkbzE1JGcwJHQxNzUyNjcwNjg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMjA0NDU4MDI1Mg..&userId=62f0aa5bcec7e365f6491e6d&referrarData=eyJ1c2VyU291cmNlRGF0YSI6Ik9USEVSUyIsInJlZmVycmVyIjoib3V0bG9va2J1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyZXJVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vdXRsb29rYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tLyJ9) Tags -

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

But this strategy is likely to achieve only modest results because of Afghanistan’s fragile economic and security environment, as well as New Delhi’s enduring ideological and cultural differences with the Taliban. Indian officials recently visited Afghanistan for the first time since the Taliban took control of the country last year. A delegation led by J.P. Singh -- a secretary overseeing India’s external affairs with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran -- traveled to Kabul on June 6 to discuss the delivery of humanitarian aid with Taliban leaders. With the exception of sending such aid and indirectly contacting Afghanistan through third countries, New Delhi had not established a formal dialogue with Kabul since the Taliban seized power in August 2021.

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi.

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://frontline.thehindu.com?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ## Stories that help you connect the dots ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

Hindu nationalist sentiment in the country is increasingly influencing its politics. (NARINDER NANU/AFP/GettyImages) Editor’s Note: Stratfor is republishing this foundational analysis from March 2016 in light of a recent flare-up of Hindu nationalist violence in India. On June 2, police clashed with armed protesters from the Hindu Netaji sect occupying a park in the city of Mathura. At least 24 people were killed and more than 300 protesters were arrested. The Hindu protesters had held the park for the past two years, demanding that India's parliament disband and that the posts of president and prime minister be abolished. In recent months, a surging wave of Hindu nationalism has challenged India's bedrock philosophy of secular pluralism, touching off a raging national debate about the fundamental nature of the country's political identity. This so-called intolerance debate has pitted traditional pluralism against a more strident, conservative religious-based conception of Indian nationhood that seeks to change the underlying principles the nation was founded upon....

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

The country’s electricity grid, which has long been associated with outages, inefficiency, and high losses, is evolving into a digitally empowered network in which real-time data, sensors, and automation drive supply, demand, and distribution. However, as this change accelerates, the essential question is no longer whether India can develop a smart grid, but how and who controls it, particularly as technology replaces current institutional structures. The National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and the Ministry of Power intend to transform India’s electrical system into a “secure, adaptive, sustainable, and digitally enabled ecosystem” via stakeholder perception. India has deployed over 40 million smart meters by mid-2025, indicating progress in the development of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). However, despite lofty goals and hardware deployment, obstacles remain. FSR Global’s March 2025 research identified a fundamental problem in developing an interoperable smart grid ecosystem, including limitations in standards, insufficient data governance, vendor fragmentation, and cyber-security concerns. Smart grids usher in a fundamentally new form of “governance”—one mediated by algorithms. AI-powered systems predict loads, reroute supply, detect defects, and (in some situations) determine dynamic tariffs. Cities like Delhi are the first to use these kinds of technologies, and state utilities are working with companies from around the world to use advanced analytics. For example, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (MSEDCL) made a deal with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to improve its system with AI, machine learning, and battery energy storage devices. But this choice makes it hard to tell who is at fault. If an algorithm sends out goods incorrectly, places businesses ahead of families, or charges a peak surcharge, who is to blame? The rules and laws haven’t been updated to align with how technology operates in the real world. If algorithmic decisions aren’t clear, operations might not be clear either. In the smart grid, data is as important as copper lines. Smart meters collect specific consumption patterns down to the appliance level; an analytics tool interprets the data and utilises it to improve network performance. But this makes people worry about privacy, security, and fairness. A recent poll by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) found that consumers are worried about billing accuracy, connectivity issues, and data privacy, which are all making it harder to roll out smart meters. Regulatory frameworks also fall behind. While the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2022, includes significant structural reforms, it does not address data ownership rights, algorithmic transparency, or consumer redress. Unless these loopholes are bridged, smart grids may recreate existing hierarchies in a new digital format. India is switching to smart grids for a number of reasons, but one of the most important is to deal with the growing amount of renewable energy, largely solar and wind, that is being used more and more at the distribution level. Smart systems help balance energy generation that happens at different times, control battery storage, and make prosumer (consumer-plus-producer) possible. The government also recently extended the interstate transmission system (ISTS) charge waiver for battery energy storage projects until June 2028. This is a big incentive for stabilising grids with a lot of renewable energy. However, as one _FT_ analysis on the “solar village” project in Gujarat highlighted, storage capacity remains a bottleneck: India needs 336 GWh by 2030, but predictions for 2026-27 are just 82 GWh. Not every state is moving at the same rate. In Karnataka, the implementation of smart meters under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) has suffered delays. A state official recently stated that even with subsidies, costs will not drop below Rs 1,000 per meter in Bengaluru. The state is still reviewing whether to opt in. In another example, India’s transmission authority recently withdrew grid access for approximately 17 GW of delayed clean-energy projects in states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in order to prioritise projects that are ready for implementation. For areas experiencing energy poverty, the transition to smart grids is about more than just efficiency; it’s about justice. The promise of increased reliability, lower losses, and lower tariffs exists, but only if the transformation is equitable. The key dimensions of justice include distributive, procedural, and recognitional. These measures demonstrate that, even as smart grid technology advances, execution limits. If smart grid governance remains opaque, the risk is a two-tier energy system: a “well-connected algorithmic” grid for some and a weak heritage grid for others. To make smart grids work for India, not just utilities, policy must keep up with technology. Algorithmic accountability frameworks require openness, auditability, and human monitoring in grid-decision systems. Data governance regime aims to figure out who owns data about how consumers use electricity, how it can be used and shared, and how to get consent. In systemic cyber resilience, it is needed to ensure that even smaller DISCOMs establish Cyber Security Operations Centers (CSOCs) and undertake regular audits. Equitable rollout options include prioritising states with high energy poverty for meter improvements, analytics tools, and demand-response programs. Secondly, interoperability standards accelerate the integration of grid protocols, vendor systems, and communication networks to prevent smart systems from becoming proprietary silos. Power plants and transmission lines will no longer define India’s energy future; instead, algorithms will play an increasingly important role. But the real test is how those algorithms are run: do they help people or systems? Do they help make things fairer or make things worse? Smart grids provide the basis for the transformation that India needs to make in order to reach its goal of 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. The grid might be getting smarter, but the people in charge need to be too. India’s move to smart grids is more than just a technological leap; it also means a change in how the energy business is run, how people are held accountable, and how justice is served. As computers take over more and more of the control of electricity flows, the decision of who gets energy, when, and for how much money moves from people to machines. This move, although promising to make things more efficient and reliable, also shows some big hazards, such as breaches of data privacy, unequal access, and slow government action. As India moves from physical to digital infrastructure, it needs to make sure that the intelligence that runs its grids is fair, accessible, and overseen by the people. _Anusreeta Dutta is a columnist and climate researcher with prior experience as a political researcher and ESG analyst._ _Aakash Bajpai is Student, Indian Institute of Forest Management._ _Views expressed are the author’s own and don’t necessarily reflect those of_ Down To Earth [power](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/power) [Privacy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/privacy) [security](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/security) [algorithms](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/algorithms) [fairness](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/topic/fairness) Show Comments Down To Earth www.downtoearth.org.in INSTALL APP",

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP/Getty Images) Kashmir is known throughout South Asia for its natural beauty, which draws visitors from far and wide. But beneath the region's alluring exterior, deep-seated grievances are beginning to jeopardize its stability. On July 8, Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, the 22-year-old commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant separatist group that calls for the India-administered portion of the region (Jammu and Kashmir) to join Pakistan.

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming. And while the value of India's currency has dipped, the rupee has depreciated far less than currencies in other countries due to a combination of central bank monetary tightening and foreign-exchange market intervention....

Surrounding the golden fortress city of Jaisalmer in India’s Thar desert, a sea of wind turbines stretches out across the arid landscape as far as the eye can see — visibly marking the world’s third-largest carbon emitter’s green power expansion. Engineers at a 30MW wind farm here operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest clean energy developers, speak with pride about contributing to a national renewable capacity goal of 500GW by 2030. Yet not all of the country’s green power can be dispatched, with the energy grid emerging as a choking constraint. Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew, is confident India will “definitely” achieve its renewable capacity target. “I can see that we’ll get to 500GW, but we won’t be able to exceed it because there’s not enough transmission.” While India boasts one of the world’s largest transmission networks, spanning more than 494,000 circuit kilometres, the grid has not kept pace with the surge in renewable projects. More than 50GW of capacity is stranded, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a US-based think-tank, and JMK Research & Analytics, an Indian cleantech research and consulting firm. © Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images “Transmission has become a critical bottleneck . . . causing rising curtailment and commissioning delays in resource-rich states,” says Jyoti Gulia, founder and chief executive of JMK. Earlier this year, Pralhad Joshi, India’s minister for new and renewable energy, hailed a “Historic Green Leap” after the country reached 50 per cent of its [power capacity from renewables](https://www.ft.com/content/a99a5845-9f50-49a3-8c7c-d704b2cf3b95), now totalling 243GW. Even so, Gulia says, grid expansion delays would “lock in higher coal generation”. Nearly three-quarters of India’s power currently comes from coal, which remains central to meeting its growing electricity demand. This is partly due to fragmented planning between state and central authorities, which largely run India’s grid, as well as mismatched build cycles. Renewable projects can be completed in 12 to 18 months, while transmission lines typically take three to five years. Clean power is also predominantly produced in three states: Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while high demand regions such as Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have little capacity, making cross state delivery critical. “To perfect the timing is impossible,” Ashish Khanna, chief executive of Adani Green Energy — the country’s largest renewable power company — said in September at the Financial Times’ Energy Transition Summit in New Delhi. “You can’t first wait for a grid to come and then build a renewable project.” Those constraints have become the most visible in the northwestern wind and sun-rich state of Rajasthan and development heavy areas there such as Jaisalmer. IEEFA and JMK estimate that 8GW of clean power capacity in the state currently cannot be transmitted. One renewable industry executive in Rajasthan says the “spurt” of green projects, paired with slow grid growth, will probably slow further capacity build out for at least a couple of years. Developers also face obstacles from environmental blockages and grinding [difficulties acquiring contiguous land](https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e) in a country with hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers. In parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat, a years-long legal ban has prevented new overhead transmission lines from being laid across more than 100,000 sq km to protect the Great Indian Bustard, a [highly endangered and poor-sighted bird](https://www.ft.com/content/cec843fe-804a-43a4-b89a-4f7970c3a6a4) known to fly into power cables. In key areas, smaller players have also exploited those time lags, pre-booking chunks of transmission capacity with no intention of building power plants — driving up premiums to secure connectivity, which they then sell to developers. This delays projects and further burdens genuine operators. Gulia says the bureaucratic need for multi-agency clearances and right-of-way permits that are frequently initiated post-award cause “months to years of delay”. Ideally there should be a single-window regulatory clearance system with strict timelines, she says, as well as performance-based incentives and disincentives. Last year India announced a plan to bolster the power grid and deploy the vast amounts of renewable energy coming online. The expansion is expected to cost Rs9.15tr ($104bn) to allow the transmission of 600GW of green power capacity by 2032. However, India’s Central Electricity Authority agency has acknowledged that public funding will not be sufficient to cover the build-out, which means the private sector is likely to have to step in. Private investment from the likes of Adani and Tata Power is already starting to reshape the sector, Khanna at Adani Green says. About 9 per cent of the grid is operated by corporates. “They are going to bring their own efficiencies to the system,” adds Khanna, “so I am hopeful that in times to come we will have less \\[of a\\] gap.” ### Europe’s Climate Leaders _The FT is compiling its sixth annual list of Europe’s climate leaders.

Image: Solar Energy Corporation of India. India’s ability to reach 500GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030 is being increasingly constrained by grid limitations and growing tender complexity, according to Abhinav Jindal, deputy general manager at India’s largest integrated power utility NTPC’s Power Management Institute (PMI). Speaking to _PV Tech_, Jindal warned that transmission readiness has become one of the most significant risks to India’s clean-energy trajectory. Solar and wind projects are now being delivered far faster than the grid is able to absorb them, he said, compared with coal’s traditional four-to-five-year development cycle that allows transmission to grow in tandem – a synchronisation that no longer exists. ## Try Premium for just $1 - Full premium access for the first month at only $1 - Converts to an annual rate after 30 days unless cancelled - Cancel anytime during the trial period [Start $1 Trial](https://www.pv-tech.org/invite/L579GzIZSq1k4q2HHP) ### Premium Benefits - Expert industry analysis and interviews - Digital access to PV Tech Power journal - Exclusive event discounts ### Or get the full Premium subscription right away [Get Premium Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/www.pv-tech.org) ### Or continue reading this article for free [Get Basic (FREE) Subscription](https://www.pv-tech.org/www.pv-tech.org) “Very often the panels are in place, the system is commissioned, but you can’t evacuate power because the transmission network has not been bolstered,” he said, noting that several states are already facing stranded renewable assets. Legacy PPAs are also limiting utilities’ ability to absorb new capacity, while ultra-low tariffs from previous auctions have made some states reluctant to honour older contracts. These challenges mirror broader national data. [A joint report by IEEFA South Asia and JMK Research, published in September 2025](https://www.pv-tech.org/grid-constraints-threatening-indias-renewable-energy-targets-report/), showed more than 50GW of renewable capacity stranded as of June 2025 due to transmission constraints. The analysis pointed to a 42% gap between planned and commissioned transmission lines and noted that ISTS additions have fallen to their lowest level in a decade. Despite mounting pressure, Jindal highlighted the national grid’s resilience, pointing to over a decade without major blackouts. Under the One Nation, One Grid (ONOG) framework and coordinated Central Electricity Authority (CEA) planning, “we continue to maintain this robustness even as renewables penetrate the grid,” he said. However, the intermittency of renewables still demands additional system capacity and more sophisticated management tools. Tender undersubscription is another growing concern. Jindal linked the trend to increasingly complex auction structures – including FDRE, RTC and storage-linked tenders – as well as unrealistic baseline cost assumptions. “Some of the estimates at a fundamental level are so low that we don’t find broad participation,” he said. The government is now reassessing L1 benchmarks to ease downward tariff pressure and encourage healthier bidding. Even so, deployment remains strong. India added nearly 30GW in FY2024-25 and is on track for another 20GW-25GW this year. At around 40GW annually, the country remains broadly aligned with its 2030 ambition – provided grid expansion and tender reform accelerate.

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

    "full_text": "South Asia will increasingly prize the Brahmaputra and Indus rivers as demographic and economic growth heighten regional water demand and intensify geopolitical rivalries, portending more severe diplomatic tensions and instability in the region over the coming years. Water insecurity remains a distinct challenge in Asia; despite the continent being home to 60% of the global population and projected to see some two-thirds of the world's population growth over the coming decade, it only has around 3,920 cubic meters of freshwater per person per year, less than any other continent besides Antarctica. This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply. Population growth and economic development have only intensified regional competition over the usage of major waterways, especially with India...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

PHOTO: ERIC LEE/NYTIMES [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy?ref=article-byline) ###### Follow topic: Donald Trump SummarySummary - Trump imposed additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, potentially escalating trade tensions and reversing strategic gains. - India's exports, especially labour-intensive sectors like textiles, face disadvantage against competitors; industry leaders fear job losses. - India hopes to negotiate the tariffs, balancing economic interests, farmer welfare, and relations with both the US and Russia. AI generated Published Aug 07, 2025, 11:00 PM Updated Aug 08, 2025, 12:56 AM NEW DELHI – US President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on India would deal a severe blow to the country’s exporters, denting growth in the world’s fourth-largest economy and putting jobs in labour-intensive sectors at risk. The first tranche of [25 per cent tariffs kicked in](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-on-goods-from-india?ref=inline-article) at midnight on Aug 7 (Eastern Standard Time). But Mr Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent on India over its purchase of Russian oil, to come into effect within 21 days. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Aug 4. Mr Trump’s latest executive order marked yet another escalation in a feud with a key Asian partner, which could reverse decades of strategic courtship by his predecessors to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would also hurt India’s ambitions to more than double its exports from US$437.4 billion (S$562 billion) in 2024 to US$1 trillion by 2030. “Given that there is a 21-day cooling period before the 50 per cent tariff kicks in, we expect some negotiation to take place to lower these rates,” Ms Sonal Badhan, an economist with Bank of Baroda, told The Straits Times. “For now, domestic fundamentals remain strong, and India being a consumption-oriented economy rather than an export-oriented economy will work in its favour,” she added, referring to how most businesses in India cater to the domestic market. As it stands, Bank of Baroda estimates 25 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US may take 0.2 percentage point off its growth forecast for the Indian economy to 6.4 per cent in 2025. Ms Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Bank in Singapore, noted that the three-week deadline “leaves the door open for negotiations and reduction in the final rate”. She noted that there could be further trade deal negotiations between India and the US, and scope for US-Russia discussions over the Ukraine war. ## Economic consequences The additional tariffs mean India may potentially join Brazil as the countries facing 50 per cent tariffs. For now, mobile phones, which make up the bulk of electronics exports, and pharmaceutical products, which together account for over 30 per cent of India’s total exports to the US of US$86.51 billion in 2024, are protected due to earlier exemptions from the Trump administration. But the tariffs would severely disadvantage India against major competitors in manufacturing and textiles in neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in South-east Asia. “When the first tariffs came at 25 per cent, we were 5 per cent above competing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia,” Mr M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of Farida Group, an India-based exporter of leather footwear, told ST. He was referring to the 20 per cent tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the US, and the 19 per cent levy imposed on Cambodian and Indonesian exports. ###### More on this topic [**Modi to speak with Lula, plans Xi meeting as ties with US sour**](https://straitstimes.com/world/modi-to-speak-with-lula-plans-xi-meeting-as-ties-with-us-sour?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**Russia and India talk up ‘strategic partnership’ after Trump tariff hike**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/russia-and-india-talk-up-strategic-partnership-after-trump-tariff-hike?ref=more-on-this-topic) “Our customers said, ‘How can we pay you more?’ So we gave them a discount of 5 per cent. We had to do it to retain customers,” said Mr Ahmed, whose company’s exports are split almost equally between Europe and the US. “The new (Russia) sanctions will discourage customers from coming to India. The uncertainty means they can switch within one week. Why should they wait for three weeks? There is no confusion over tariffs in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.” Apart from leather, exporters of chemicals, footwear, gems and jewellery, textiles and shrimp are among those with the largest exposure to the US market, and are likely to keenly feel the impact of a 50 per cent tariff hike. For many of these labour-intensive sectors, loss of export revenue would likely translate into job losses. The Indian textile industry, for instance, employs over 45 million people, making it a leading source of employment. Mr Sudhir Sekhri, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, warned that 50 per cent tariffs on India’s exports to the US would be a “death knell” for the micro and medium apparel industry. “There is no way the industry can absorb this,” he said. A third of India’s garment exports went to the US in 2024. Mr Ahmed does not see diversifying beyond the US, which is the largest consumer market in the world, as a feasible option, given that it would take beyond a year to look for new markets. ## Tariff negotiations In announcing the first 25 per cent tariff on India, Mr Trump on July 30 slammed the South Asian country’s “obnoxious” trade barriers. Much of his frustration stems from India’s refusal to open its market to US agriculture and dairy imports. These two sectors are a lifeline for more than 60 per cent of India’s population. Farmer groups have opposed the entry of American produce, saying they would not be able to compete. “Farmers’ interest is our top priority. India will not bow to pressure or compromise the welfare of its farmers, fishermen or dairy farmers,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Aug 7, repeating the stand he had made before. “If I have to pay a price for this, I am ready.” Farmers wield enormous political clout, with Mr Modi facing state-level elections. India and the US are due for more negotiations later in August. Hope for exporters hinges on whether India can negotiate away the forthcoming penalty tariffs for buying Russian oil. Around 36 per cent of India’s total crude oil imports were from Russia in 2024. Even as Mr Trump’s evident ire over India-Russia relations grows, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Russia for talks on security and energy. Mr Doval on Aug 7 also announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit India later in the year for the India-Russia summit. The Indian government has not indicated that it would stop buying oil from Russia, a country with which it has longstanding ties. “Pressure is now mounting on India to come to a trade agreement,” Ms Teresa John, deputy head of research and lead economist at Nirmal Bang, a stockbroking company, told ST. “While India may still be wary of opening up its agriculture sector, India could agree to reduce dependence on Russian oil and defence in a phased manner and diversify to other sources,” said Ms John. “Notably, there will be pressure to import more of both oil and defence equipment from the US.” ###### More on this topic [**Trump may look like he’s winning the trade war, but hurdles remain**](https://straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-may-look-like-hes-winning-the-trade-war-but-hurdles-remain?ref=more-on-this-topic) [**India’s Modi vows no compromise on farmers interests amid Trump’s tariff salvo**](https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/indias-modi-says-will-not-compromise-interests-of-farmers-amid-trumps-tariff-salvo?ref=more-on-this-topic) [Nirmala Ganapathy](https://www.straitstimes.com/authors/nirmala-ganapathy) is India bureau chief at The Straits Times.

    "full_text": "With Washington launching its protectionist trade offensive, New Delhi faces a pivotal test in balancing national interests and global market access. **Impact of US tariffs**: The much-dreaded Liberation Day, Washington’s euphemism for a sweeping wave of tariffs, finally arrived on April 2. As anticipated, India found itself on the receiving end, with a 26% tariff slapped on its exports to the United States. The move has raised serious concerns about the future of trade ties between New Delhi and its largest export destination. In a dramatic shift from traditional diplomacy, President Donald Trump announced that the US would impose tariffs equal to half of what other countries charge on American goods. Since India levies a cumulative 52% tariff on US products, the new White House annexure listed a reciprocal 27% tariff on Indian goods. But this is only the beginning. According to a White House fact sheet, a 10% base tariff on all imports will take effect from April 5. From April 9, countries running the highest trade deficits with the US — including India — will face even steeper levies. A total of 185 countries are expected to be impacted. With these moves, the average US tariff rate has now surged to 29% — its highest level in over a century. **READ \\| [Ayushman Bharat: A grand promise undone by poor execution](https://www.policycircle.org/society/ayushman-bharat-scheme-pmjay/)** ### **Blow to India’s export ambitions** The fallout for India is likely to be significant. The US is one of the few major economies with which India enjoys a trade surplus — $46 billion as of 2024. However, these gains now stand threatened. India had already been in Washington’s crosshairs, featuring in Trump’s infamous Dirty 15 list — countries deemed the worst offenders in terms of trade practices. The sectors expected to be hit hardest include agriculture, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and precious stones. #### Trump effect: Additional US tariffs on India Compiled by Murali Kallummal, Professor, Centre for WTO Studies, IIFT According to a recent study by the Global Trade Research Initiative ( [GTRI](https://gtri.co.in/)), the most affected agricultural segments will be fish, meat, and processed seafood — which together accounted for $2.58 billion in exports to the US last year. Notably, America absorbs 40% of India’s total shrimp exports. Higher tariffs will erode competitiveness and shrink market share. India’s gains in electronics could also unravel. The Indian government had worked to position the country as a viable alternative to China under the China+1 strategy, especially in smartphone manufacturing. Finished smartphones currently attract a 16-20% import duty in India, while Indian exports to the US enjoy zero duty. But if US tariffs now apply to Indian phones, the fledgling sector may suffer a blow in its early growth phase, potentially reversing hard-won progress. One silver lining, however, is that India’s IT services — which form a large chunk of exports — are exempt from goods-specific tariffs, at least for now. ### **Navigating a rising trade storm** The pressing question for India’s policymakers is: how to counter mounting trade pressure from Washington without derailing its export-led growth strategy? A crucial step would be to fast-track the ongoing negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US. Talks have been in motion, and both sides have incentives to reach an accord quickly. A successful BTA could offer exemptions or relief from some of the punitive measures. India has already taken pre-emptive steps. In March, New Delhi signed the terms of reference for a BTA following a push from the Prime Minister’s Office. It also lowered duties on select American products — including high-end motorcycles, agricultural goods, and Bourbon whiskey — in its Union Budget, signalling a willingness to negotiate. Still, New Delhi must tread carefully. While India’s tariff levels may appear high, they reflect domestic development goals and the need to protect vulnerable industries. The US prioritises its commercial interests. India too must evaluate each demand against its own national priorities — development, industrialisation, and cultural values. A recent PwC report recommended that Indian businesses build long-term resilience strategies — including diversification of markets and value chain upgrades — to mitigate the impact of US protectionism. ### **Strategic realignments** Amid this backdrop, an intriguing diplomatic overture emerged. On April 2 — coinciding with the US tariff announcement — China and India marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a message to Indian President Droupadi Murmu, called for a “dragon-elephant tango” to strengthen cooperation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed the sentiment, noting that stronger India-China ties would support a stable, multipolar world. Observers see this as a subtle signal to Washington: major developing economies are willing to explore alternative alliances if pushed too hard. Xi emphasised the need for mutual modernisation between China and India as leading voices of the Global South — perhaps suggesting a pivot away from overreliance on Western markets. ### **The road ahead** The 26% reciprocal tariff may compel India to re-examine its own tariff structures, not just in response to the US, but to remain competitive in global markets. The coming weeks will be critical as New Delhi awaits a formal list of US demands and considers its options. India remains an essential market for US companies across sectors — from tech to pharmaceuticals — and this mutual interdependence offers room for compromise. India’s strategy should be to engage the US in negotiations rather than escalate into a full-blown trade war. As noted in a Bernstein report, India’s measured, diplomatic approach could help it navigate the turbulent waters of trade protectionism, preserving both economic stability and strategic autonomy.

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Equity securities may fluctuate in value and can decline significantly in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions. Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk (as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk. These effects are usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Currency Risk is a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another. Whenever investors or companies have assets or business operations across national borders, they face currency risk if their positions are not hedged. Generally, among asset classes, stocks are more volatile than bonds or short-term instruments. Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns. U.S. Treasury Bills maintain a stable value if held to maturity, but returns are generally only slightly above the inflation rate. © 2025 State Street Corporation - All Rights Reserved.

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances. This announcement came as all three countries are engaged in International Monetary Fund programs and face economic challenges, including high debt burdens and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. ...",

The two countries are close to a short-term trade deal, but a long-term pact is an entirely different proposition. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) The United States' trade war with China grabs all the headlines, but U.S. President Donald Trump is also bearing down on another major Asian economy: India. In June, Trump accused the Indian government of failing to provide \"equitable and reasonable market access\" and stripped New Delhi of its benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences, which enables India to export certain goods at a reduced tariff rate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration retaliated by slapping tariffs on 28 U.S. goods. While the sides could soon clinch a short-term trade deal, the United States and India will have several outstanding issues to address before they finalize a more comprehensive pact.
