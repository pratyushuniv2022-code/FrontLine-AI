These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. India’s long-running class-based, economic insurgency—the Naxalite insurgency (or Community Party of India [CPI]-Maoist insurgency)—is a case study in which external secu\u0002rity partnerships will remain limited, if not mostly unwelcomed, in New Delhi. Known as “the greatest domestic security threat faced by India” from 2006 to 2011, the Naxalite insurgency has receded and largely been contained—albeit still far from eliminated—as of 2016. India’s security response to the Naxalite insurgency from 2004 to 2015 demonstrates that New Delhi will prefer limited interaction with external security partners when addressing matters of do\u0002mestic counterinsurgency. With this insight, U.S. policymakers should not expect that New Delhi will accept direct assistance for its domestic counterinsurgency units in the foreseeable future, and the United States should not press India too hard on this issue. Washington would be ill-served by an In\u0002dian backlash to such unwelcomed assertiveness. Any Indian backlash might curb or reverse far more important bilateral military-to-military interactions including joint maritime secu\u0002rity activities in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, bilateral interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed Sino-Indian border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counter\u0002terrorism intelligence-sharing and operations. The United States instead should focus on not only its offers of major near-term bilateral military assistance for security cooperation but also, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns in New Delhi and Washington. 2 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Introduction This paper frames the contours of the recent and ongoing expansion in U.S.-India security ties. Then it briefly sketches the trajectory of the Naxalite insurgency through its first two phases and then focuses on the factors that made its third phase—from 2004 to the present—such a serious security challenge. The paper highlights the unique domestic factors that allowed the Naxalite rebellion’s rise to the status of India’s most significant internal security challenge from 2007 to 2010. It also identifies those domestic factors that enabled effective counterinsurgency actions beginning in 2011 and effective containment of the threat by 2014. After indicating the kinds of bilateral security assistance offered by the United States to India in recent years, the paper indicates the limited appeal of outside assistance to India in the domestic counterinsur\u0002gency arena and assesses why India’s self-selected counterinsurgency partnership limitations remain firmly in place. It concludes with some lessons learned for U.S. policymakers in terms of the opportunities and limitations for working with India in matters of domestic insurgency, advising that these limitations make sense on many levels. It also asserts that India’s limitations should be respected in Washington and Honolulu to avoid backlash from New Delhi. Any such backlash might threaten far more important U.S.-India bilateral interests in which shared mari\u0002time and other strategic interests seem to increasingly diverge with those of China and in areas of mutual benefit from global counterterrorism cooperation. The analysis in this paper is based on 3 years of author research into the unique features of the Naxalite insurgency in India. The research includes field interviews conducted on three visits to India during 2014 and 2015, one of which featured time in Kolkata and West Bengal. Expanding U.S.-India Security Framework, with Limits Growing for more than a decade, bilateral defense and security cooperation between the United States and India began accelerating quickly in 2014 and continued into 2016. Much of this acceleration, although not all of it, owed to the tone and tenor of the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, elected and seated in 2014. Modi’s government, which is Indian nationalist with a dynamic economic, diplomatic, and security agenda, followed a decade-long Indian National Congress (INC) government that had become sclerotic in its dealings with the United States and other global partners from 2009 to 2013. The INC government set the table for U.S.-India defense and security cooperation during the mid-2000s, demonstrating a broad\u0002based Indian commitment to improved bilateral relations with the United States after decades 3 India’s Naxalite Insurgency of limited transactions. But the nationalist government of Prime Minister Modi has been driv\u0002ing it forward vigorously. The ongoing acceleration in broad Indo-American relations has taken many forms, in\u0002cluding high diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi made visiting the United States a priority, travel\u0002ing to America within 4 months of his May 2014 accession to the position of prime minister. Modi then made President Barack Obama the first ever U.S. President bestowed the high honor as chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade in January 2015. During this visit, Obama and Modi signed a historic Joint U.S.-India Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.1 Modi made a third informal visit to the United States in September 2015, using this historically rapid return to enhance economic relations between the national private and public sectors.2 The United States has committed to a wide array of economic projects in India fea\u0002turing public-private innovation, deeper financial cooperation and inclusive digital networks, “smart city” development in selected Indian cities, and support for increasing economic con\u0002nectivity between India and the states of South and Southeast Asia.3 The acceleration of broad bilateral ties has been showcased by the steady increase in de\u0002fense and security cooperation between the two countries. In June 2016, on a historic fourth visit to the United States and in conjunction with a third bilateral summit,4 Prime Minister Modi made a joint statement with President Obama declaring India and the United States to be “major defense partners,” expressing aspirations for expanded exchange of dual-use technolo\u0002gies and maritime security cooperation.5 The outcomes from this mid-2016 leadership engage\u0002ment underscored the fact that there have been noteworthy enhancements in military technol\u0002ogy interaction processes, basic military logistics and administrative arrangements, and joint military exercises. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi has accelerated the process of bilateral security collabo\u0002ration on military modernization with emphasis on greater foreign investment in the Indian defense sector than ever before. Modi’s government covets American participation in India’s defense industry build-out to a degree not seen in the previous Indian government. The United States has worked to expand its 2012 bilateral defense initiative with India known as the U.S.- India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Pursuant to President Obama’s January 2015 visit for Republic Day, the United States has focused DTTI in pursuit of six major defense technology co-development and co-production efforts. There has been a particular focus on deeper cooperation in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.6 The United States and India also have done serious work on establishing basic frame\u0002work defense agreements that would enable closer cooperation and collaboration between their 4 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 militaries. Throughout 2015 and early 2016, both governments worked hard to develop mutu\u0002ally acceptable text for three critical military-to-military agreements. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), Basic Exchange and Coopera\u0002tion Agreement (BECA), and—perhaps the most consequential of the three—Logistics Supply Agreement.7 Aimed to move beyond the limited U.S.-India 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement that underpinned modest U.S.-India defense interactions for more than a decade, the bilateral effort on these documents demonstrated important forward prog\u0002ress. Yet this progress did not beget culmination in formal agreements. Many observers hoped that these arrangements would be ready for signature during Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s April 2016 visit to New Delhi for discussions with Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar. But Indian sensitivities and complications in language and trust limited the April joint announce\u0002ment to one confirming that the defense leaders were agreed in principal—but had not yet signed—a modified Logistics Supply Agreement, known as a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement.8 It also signaled that both parties must continue to work on “other” agreements to enhance military cooperation and technology transfer. The CISMOA and BECA were not formally mentioned in the final statement of the meeting.9 In the area of joint military exercises, the U.S.-India partnership has been expanding. In 2015, India conducted more joint military exercises with the U.S. military than any other in the world.10 India and United States agreed in 2015 to extend a permanent invitation for Japanese naval forces to participate annually in Exercise Malabar. The United States, India, and Japan held Malabar 2016 in early June in the northern waters of the Philippine Sea, an area close to the East and South China seas, signaling to Beijing that the three nations hold a common interest in freedom of high seas navigation in all areas of the Pacific Ocean.11 But the acceleration and expansion of bilateral security interactions come with Indian limitations—ones that must temper U.S. policymaker aims, ambitions, and expectations. While agreeing to participate in the 2016 Malabar exercise with Japan and the United States in the northern Philippines, India firmly declined an offer by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, to sign on for joint naval patrols with the United States, Japan, and Aus\u0002tralia in the South Pacific.12 India also has remained wary of any firm commitment to a bilateral defense CISMOA or BECA. Despite more than 2 years of bilateral effort, there remains no real progress on the joint development of jet engines or aircraft carrier technologies—both of which are target technologies for joint development.13 Each of these factors and more demonstrate that crafting a bilateral defense partnership between the United States and India will be a slow process 5 India’s Naxalite Insurgency that requires better understanding of differing critical equities. This process requires sustained, patient leadership in both countries in the face of certain frustrations moving forward. Scoping Bilateral Security Collaboration Limits: Indian Domestic Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism The U.S. and Indian militaries have their own detailed and unique experiences in counter\u0002insurgency operations, so counterinsurgency seems a logical focal point for greater U.S.-India defense collaboration and partnership, and in many ways it is. But in other ways, it is not. U.S. policymakers and security analysts should understand the differences. When it comes to outside assistance and security partnership collaboration with India in its ongoing experiences with domestic insurgency, U.S. policymakers and military leaders must remain aware that India does not—and likely will not—treat U.S. military offers of direct assis\u0002tance with a warm welcome. India’s experiences with its long-running domestic Naxalite insur\u0002gency provide a powerful example about the limited scope for U.S. military engagement and the circumspect manner in which any U.S. security assistance must be approached with New Delhi. The lessons about context, tenor, and tone found in the example of the Naxalite insurgency over the past 10 years demonstrate that the United States is a better partner for India when remaining at distance, as New Delhi deals with its unique domestic insurgency challenges. India’s Approach to Domestic Insurgency Over the past 60 years, India has confronted three major domestic insurgencies.14 In Jam\u0002mu and Kashmir, disaffected Muslim groups and unsatisfied local populations have contested India’s so-called occupation of its territories on the southeastern side of the Line of Control. India’s northeast has undergone multiple, overlapping waves of tribal, socioethnic-based insur\u0002gent movements since the mid-1950s. These northeastern separatist insurgencies have ebbed and flowed as Indian military and political approaches to their grievances eliminated some and catalyzed others. India also has been confronted with economic class–based violence and armed confrontation in its eastern regions, violence referred to as a Naxalite or Maoist insurgency. Numerous Indian analysts, and some outsiders, argue that India has among the best re\u0002cords in the world when combating insurgencies.15 The claim is debatable on many levels. Yet it does accurately reflect that India has persistent experience with a variety of domestic insurgencies over a considerable period of time. Official Indian counterinsurgency doctrine formally espouses a population-centric strategy focused on winning “hearts and minds.”16 A more detailed examination of India’s record reveals that India often does take a political 6 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 approach in combination with a military one when facing domestic insurgencies. However, India’s political approaches often are less about hearts and minds and more often feature ex\u0002tended periods of national-level tolerance of state- and local-level politician and police leader\u0002ship manipulation of insurgent groups. Often this manipulation is in the pursuit of regional and local vote banks (or vote blocks). Frequently manipulation is followed by the co-option of rebellion elites in an effort to buy-out, or limit the insurgency once it festers to a level beyond the ability of the state and regional authorities to manage. Co-option approaches have taken the forms of turning insurgents through monetary compensation, creating new political space for a “turned” insurgent group, or abducting and torturing key insurgent leaders.17 Quite often these nonkinetic approaches have created their own problems with corrupt security forces, increased criminal activity, and a litany of human rights complaints and investigations.18 India’s employment of military forces in domestic counterinsurgency operations has fea\u0002tured a number of innovative practices, some successful and others counterproductive. When engaged fully, the Indian national response tends to feature a combination of state police forces, Central Armed Police Forces, special paramilitary units, and—in some cases such as Kashmir and India’s Northeast—the introduction of regular army units. India’s federal statutes mandate that the chief minister (or governor) of a state formally request national police (including Cen\u0002tral Armed Police Forces units), paramilitary, or national army support before such forces can be introduced into a counterinsurgency fight. In those cases when the army is introduced, it must be authorized by the prime minister and given authorities by the Indian parliament to operate under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which includes the authority for military forces to make arrests, search without warrants, and shoot to kill civilians when required.19 In\u0002dia’s martial counterinsurgency activities are normally “enemy centric” and have been assessed to regularly feature a strategy of attrition and raw coercion where overwhelming numbers of security forces attempt to suffocate the insurgency at the same time that political activities are conducted to co-opt its leadership.20 There are several important conclusions to be drawn about India’s historical approach to domestic counterinsurgency. First, India does pursue varied counterinsurgency approaches to its multiple domestic insurgencies, depending on the unique context of each. Some respons\u0002es—such as those in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast India—have featured a permanent deployment of the Indian army. Other responses, such as those toward the respective phases of the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India, have been limited to national central armed police forces (mainly but not exclusively Central Reserve Police Forces [CRPF]) deployment into the unsettled states from the central government (see appendix B for detail on national special 7 India’s Naxalite Insurgency police units). Second, India’s political and military approaches toward domestic insurgency generally do not follow a classic hearts and minds approach. Instead, they normally feature enemy-centric and highly kinetic military operations combined with creative, and often con\u0002troversial, political co-option of selected insurgent groups and group leaders. Third, India’s federal democratic structure often drives domestic counterinsurgency responses that feature uncomfortable political tradeoffs at the local level, state level, and between the state and the national governments. The political mobilization aspect of domestic insurgent groups creates incentives for political parties to harness these groups for their own ends.21 Invariably, this political utility makes them hard to counter in a timely manner and then difficult to address in the face of growing corruption, illegal activities, and often human rights questions as they embed into the political and social space. In general, Indian domestic counterinsurgency has worked for the country out and its distinctive system of governance and its complex national ethnic makeup. India’s approaches have contained, but not eliminated, the three major insurgencies that it has faced since inde\u0002pendence. But for many Westerners, India’s domestic counterinsurgency “successes” can look exceptionally violent and uncomfortably incomplete.22 This divergence in perspectives is im\u0002portant. It indicates why India prefers strict autonomy in the conduct of its domestic counterin\u0002surgent operations, routinely brushing aside the limited offers of direct outside military support that it receives. It also demonstrates why outside partners, including the United States, should realize that if they push too aggressively in offering well-intentioned direct assistance in these areas, they could encounter significant resistance in New Delhi—possible to the point where security cooperation could be dampened in other more important areas of mutual interest. India’s deep past and recent experiences with the Naxalite insurgency demonstrate the wisdom of these conclusions. The Naxalite Insurgency—History and Context: Phases 1 and 2 The Naxalite insurgency started as a communist peasant revolt in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It later evolved into a combination of ethnic-, caste-, and class-based political violence across a number of the poorest provinces in India’s east.23 It became known as Naxalism, or the Naxalite movement, given its late 1950s origins as a Maoist movement struggling for in\u0002dependence in the small village of Naxalbari in the state of West Bengal, along the Indo-Nepal border (see map 1).24 The 1967 Naxalbari uprising against feudal landlords sowed the seeds for insurgency in India.25 8 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 The Naxalites were a group of far-left radical communists who promoted Maoist political sentiment and ideology to fight exploitation by landlords in India’s feudal postcolonial socio\u0002economic system. In this approach, the Naxalites broke from the tradition of Indian communist Map 1. States and Union Territories of India 9 India’s Naxalite Insurgency political participation in the electoral system supplemented by general worker strikes that had been the staple of Communist Party of India activity from the 1920s through the 1950s.26 Dur\u0002ing the 1940s and 1950s, the CPI had become aligned with Moscow in its international leanings, functioning in India mainly as a political party. Around the same time, communism in India split in a third direction, with the CPI-Marxist group taking a more radical approach to its po\u0002litical rhetoric but mainly pursuing its own independent parliamentary path.27 Naxalism is based upon an extremist belief that the Indian government is a semicolonial, feudalistic, and imperial entity that needs to be overthrown. Naxalism’s objective is to seize state power through a protracted armed struggle against big landlords and petty government of\u0002ficials. Naxalism takes up the cause of the marginalized sections of society. It often opposes the implementation of various developmental projects such as construction of roads, rails, schools, and hospitals in affected areas in order to demonstrate to the people the ineffectiveness of the state. When successful, the Naxalite movement has operated in a vacuum created by the absence or collapse of the administrative structure at the local, provincial, or state level.28 The Naxalite movement has evolved through three separate phases in India. The first phase ran from the late 1960s through 1973. The second phase occurred from the late 1970s through 1994. The third and most significant phase formally began in 2004, reaching a peak of violence from 2005 to 2011 and declining to a nadir in 2014. A short review of the first two phases of the Naxalite insurgency establishes its patterns and India’s preferred security framework for dealing with this domestic stability threat. A more detailed review of the third and most noteworthy phase of the Naxalite insurgency follows in a subsequent section. First Phase, 1967–1973 Inspired by Maoist revolutionary tactics and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Naxalite movement gained momentum and began in the late 1960s and 1970s. Initially the movement centered in the Indian states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh (map 1). It featured peasants seizing land by force and then taking up arms to protect themselves against police and landlord response.29 Soon these rural activities merged with politically disillusioned and ideologically driven university students from Kolkata and other urban areas in India’s Far East—with active cells stretching from the state of Bihar in the north to Adhra Pradesh in the south. By 1969 un\u0002der charismatic leader Charu Mazumdar, the Naxalites organized as the CPI–Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) and attempted more centralized and violent tactics.30 CPI-ML moved to organize peasants and seize political power through guerilla warfare while focusing on annihilation of its class enemies.31 In urban areas such as Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), Naxalite insurgents 10 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 targeted police and local constables, attacking police outposts and patrols with an aim to cap\u0002ture weapons.32 Despite some limited weapons assistance and rhetorical support from Mao’s Communist government in the 1960s, China never undertook a strong campaign of support for the Nax\u0002alites.33 The Naxalites remained fragmented and without much training or organization. This first wave of Naxalite violence peaked in 1971 when over 3,650 acts of class-based attacks were reported and more than 850 people were reported killed. But it quickly succumbed to its own weaknesses and a state counterinsurgency response that featured two waves of activity. From the summer of 1969 through the end of 1971, state-led counterinsurgency campaigns against the rural Naxalite cadres decimated much of those insurgency cadres. State police, as\u0002sisted by the CRPF, moved against poorly armed Naxalites with great effect. By 1971 these po\u0002lice forces were joined by army units deployed into West Bengal. It took the failure of local and state police to contain Naxalite insurgents for more than 2 years before the West Bengal deputy chief minister—himself a politician from the CPI-Maoist party—requested assistance from a central paramilitary force, the Eastern Frontier Rifles, to assist state security forces. Then in July and August of 1971 a more dangerous component of the Naxalite insurgency in West Ben\u0002gal’s Birbhum District was put down by a joint campaign led by the army known as Operation Steeplechase. Army involvement only came after the collapse of an Indian National Congress– led coalition government in West Bengal and the New Delhi declaration of “President’s Rule” throughout the region. This made the central government responsible for the fight against the Naxalites and enabled Prime Minister Indira Ghandi to divert elements of the army massing along the East Pakistan border for what would become the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani War that assisted local police in decisive counterinsurgency operations.34 The urban dimension of the first wave of the Naxalite insurgency remained violent throughout 1971 and festered into the next 2 years, even as the rural component succumbed to Operation Steeplechase. Interparty political violence in Kolkata among the INC, CPI-M, and CPI-ML led to a swirl of assassinations and attacks against security forces and political leaders across urban areas. The election of a new West Bengal chief minister from the INC in March 1972 turned the tide on the urban Naxals. The law and order platform of Chief Minister Sid\u0002dharth Shankar Ray played out in a much more muscular police role across Kolkata and its surroundings throughout mid-1972 and into mid-1973. Kolkata police apprehended Naxalite leader Charu Maumdar in July 1972, and he died in custody several weeks later. Naxalite lead\u0002ers across the city succumbed to increasing police and state paramilitary presence. By 1973 the main cadres of the Naxalites had been eliminated and were dead or behind bars.35 11 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In this first Naxalite insurgent phase, the national government followed a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent phases. It did not forcibly intervene in the beginning. In keep\u0002ing with the federalist framework of the constitution, the government in New Delhi left it to local and state officials in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and other afflicted states to take their own security actions to stop the threat. In the late 1960s, these state and local responses were often inadequate and ineffective.36 The central government only engaged with security forces once it had a critical mass of army forces in the region for the 1971–1972 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh and when the President’s Rule special authorities were in place, which enabled the military the power to make preventative arrests, search premises without a warrant, and shoot to kill civilians. Once engaged, the slowly evolving national response became one featuring intense force and coercion, eradicating the violence without eliminating the insurgency’s socio\u0002economic preconditions. Second Phase, 1977–1994 India’s first wave of insurgent violence ended badly for this domestic left-wing extremist movement but did not eliminate the conditions inspiring the movement or all of those willing to hold to the Naxalite cause. The movement fractured into more than 40 separate small groups.37 Slowly—over the course of a decade—these groups began to remobilize and consolidate. Par\u0002ticularly in the southeastern Indian state of Adhra Pradesh, a new Naxalite organization called People’s War emerged. Its leader, Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, sought a more efficient structure to boost morale, recruitment, and funding. By 1978 Naxalite peasant revolts had spread to the Karimnagar District of Telangana and Adilabad District of Adhra Pradesh. The major grievance was unpaid wages. Second-wave Naxalite insurgents kidnapped landlords and forced them to confess to crimes, apologize to villagers, and repay forced bribes. By the early 1980s insurgents had established a stronghold and sanctuary in the interlinked North Telangana village and Dan\u0002dakaranya forests areas along the Adhra Pradesh and Orissa border.38 In 1985 Naxalite insurgents began ambushing police. After they killed a police sub-inspec\u0002tor in Warangal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh responded by creating a special task force called the Greyhounds to establish control in the seven worst affected districts. An elite anti-Naxalite commando unit that still exists today, the Greyhounds were drawn from within the Andhra Pradesh police forces and given special treatment. A 2,000-strong force in 2015, the Grey\u0002hounds were given preferred payment and training—better than federal or state paramilitary forces. They were also highly supported by the entire state police force. The Greyhounds played a minimal role in combatting the Naxalites during the second phase of the Maoist insurgency.39 12 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In 1987 the Naxalite political party (People’s War) and other Maoist groups in Andhra Pradesh were barred from elections after kidnapped government officials were exchanged for Naxalite prisoners. The ban was briefly lifted in 1991. In December of that year, however, insur\u0002gent attacks increased. Affected states responded by establishing special laws that enabled police to focus on capture, detention, and extra-normal means of violence against Naxalite cadres— fighters and presumed supporters.40 Adhra Pradesh and Orissa invited additional central para\u0002military forces in Telangana to augment state and federal government security forces already there. Besides brute force, the state set up rival mass organizations to attract youth away from the Naxalites, started rehabilitation programs, and established new informant networks.41 The new counterinsurgency strategy reduced violent incidents, and nearly 9,000 Naxalites surrendered. Consequently in 1994 the ban on ostensibly moderate Naxalite political parties was lifted.42 The second wave of the Naxalite insurgency had been stopped. However, and as at the end of the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency, the socioeconomic conditions underpin\u0002ning Naxalism remained largely unchanged in many regions of eastern India. Third Phase, 2004–2015 From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s the Naxalite insurgency remained largely out of the public eye, but the movement had not gone away. Taking advantage of rising local support for violent response to economic conditions, fragmented Naxalite groups created a united front: the People’s War, Party Unity, and the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) combined to form the People’s War Group (PWG). Naxalism manifested itself in episodic spurts of violence by the PWG, which had its most pronounced presence in Adhra Pradesh. From 1999–2002, local level violence increased. The PWG accelerated attacks on state government locations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. By 2000 an estimated 3,000 armed Naxalite rebels were re\u0002portedly active in India’s east.43 During this time, Indian government agencies took actions that accelerated grievances among the poor and displaced with sympathies for left-wing violence. First, economic growth and development led to local and state government appropriation of land for infrastructure and resource development, displacing many underprivileged people who had no political voice. Second, governments responded to Naxalite violence with acute violence, reportedly includ\u0002ing the extra-judicial murder and torture of suspected rebels and rebel families.44 The MCC intensified its campaign of violence against Indian security forces and government agencies in 2002–2003 after its leader was killed by police.45 13 India’s Naxalite Insurgency In 2004, the PWG was superseded by the CPI-M.46 From this 2004 merger of the two larg\u0002est Naxalite factions—the PWG and MCC—into the CPI-M, Maoist ideology was fused with a cadre of armed groups for the first time.47 A third and more lethal wave of violence—more sophisticated and more destructive—rapidly spread throughout eastern India. Naxalite leaders expanded control over natural resource rich areas (for example, coal, gas, precious minerals, and timber). They also collected taxes and extortion money to fund weapons production, including the production of crude but effective improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Estimates from 2004 to 2011 suggest the Naxalites extracted at least $18.4 million annually from government offices, contractors, businessmen, and industrialists.They embarked upon more choreographed terror campaigns including the murder of local politicians, overwhelming attacks on local police sta\u0002tions, impressment of child soldiers, and a general campaign to scare away outside investors. By the second half of 2005, Naxalites demonstrated a lethality and reach far beyond the capacity of other domestic terrorist and insurgent groups. They destroyed buildings, captured weapons, and killed several local policemen in an attack on a village in Uttar Pradesh. They also attacked the Jehanabad Prison in Bihar, killing two, freeing more than 300 inmates, and abduct\u0002ing about 30 inmates who were members of an anti-Naxalite group. Total deaths from Naxalite\u0002attributed insurgency and terrorism grew to more than 800 in the impacted east and north\u0002eastern regions.48 In 2006 and 2007, this trend expanded. In 2006, Naxalite groups launched several high-profile attacks against civilians and security forces, expanding the rural territory under Maoist control and under threat of extreme violence. In one event, an attack by some 800 armed Naxalites in Chhattisgarh killed 25, injured 80 more, and saw some 250 people declared missing.49 In 2006, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh grew concerned about the mounting threat posed by Naxalite groups to internal stability and democratic traditions across the east and southeast of India. The Naxalite menace had grown such that 18 of India’s federal states and 194 of its total districts were effected by Naxalite violence. For the first time Prime Minister Singh called the Naxalite/Maoist insurgency and associated terrorism “the sin\u0002gle biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country.”50 In 2007 Naxalite and Maoist violence reached an apex where it would remain for the next 4 years through 2010 (see map 2). Over 971 Naxalite attacks were recorded in the first seven months of 2007. That number would grow to over 1,500 attacks by the end of the year (see table51). Left-wing extremists began target\u0002ing elected officials including a member of the Indian parliament from Jharkhand state and the son of a former chief minister (or governor) of Andhra Pradesh.52 By 2010 the Naxalites were active in nine Indian states and reported to have a strong foot\u0002hold in parts of seven: West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, 14 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 and Maharashtra. This region happened to sit atop tremendous iron ore, coal, and aluminum deposits as well as irrigation and hydroelectric power potential. Across these states there were more than 2,200 incidents of Naxalite violence and almost 1,200 killed in 2010 alone (table).53 Map 2. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2007 15 India’s Naxalite Insurgency The threat to Indian national interests became obvious to the federal government and more co\u0002ordinated actions followed. From 2005 through 2010, Naxalite violence and the insufficient state-led, federally sup\u0002ported efforts to counter it cost India an average of more than 700 deaths per year. Most of these individuals were classified as civilian (see appendix A). Recruited from the disaffected rural poor, Naxalite cadres grew by 2010 to an estimated 20,000 armed fighters and an additional 50,000 supporters.54 In 2010, as he had first done in 2006, Prime Minister Singh trumpeted the risks of Naxalite violence to the stability and the ever important economic growth for the country. In May of that year, Prime Minister Singh referred to Naxalism as the “biggest internal security challenge” India has ever faced.55 The national government was understandably frustrated. From January to June 2009, India witnessed over 1,100 Naxalite-generated incidents of violence. These would double by the end of 2009 (table). Major violence occurred during national elections held from April to May 2009 as Naxalites called for an election boycott, attacked polling places, set off land mines, and even took control of a region of West Bengal known as Lalgarh. Paramilitary and police response operations against Naxalite locations were largely unsuccessful.56 Naxalite atrocities gained national notoriety. But simultaneously, accusations of systematic local police brutality and local and federal police human rights abuses against innocent civilians grew more vocal throughout the affected zones.57 In 2010 Naxalite violence inflicted 9 separate states of India and over 200 individual districts.58 Year 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 All Incidents 1,088 1,091 1,136 1,415 1,760 2,212 2,258 1,591 1,565 1,509 1,608 1,533 Attacks on Police 118 155 143 135 131 230 250 192 N/A 210 194 N/A Total Deaths 251 280 376 321 532 1,138 907 648 650 685 846 636 N/A = specific data not available Sources: “Left Wing Extremist (LWE) Data,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of Naxal Violence During 2008 to 2012,” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; “State-Wise Extent of LWE Violence During 2011 to 2016 (up to 31.03.2016),” South Asia Terrorism Portal, available at; Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs, “Annual Reports,” available at. Table. Major Incidents During Naxalite Insurgency, Third Phase 16 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 In March 2010, after months of prevarication and confusion, the national government launched Operation Green Hunt. The initiative added an additional estimated 20,000 federal paramilitary troops, mainly from the CRPF battalions, to existing state, local, and already pres\u0002ent Ministry of Home Affairs forces from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Forc\u0002es, and Shashastra Seema Bal.59 (See appendix B for detail on MHA special police units.) The operation sent federal, state, and local police and paramilitary forces into former no-go zones deep in the forests of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states to rid them of militants, but these operations struggled. In April 2010, Naxalite insurgents ambushed 80 troops of the Indian Cen\u0002tral Police Security Forces (CPSF) in Chhattisgarh, killing an estimated 75 in the worst attack on Indian security forces since the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency began.60 In February 2011 Naxalites kidnapped two Indian government officials, demanding a halt to Green Hunt. The government agreed. The Naxalites also demanded the release of seven top imprisoned lead\u0002ers in exchange for the two officials. After a May 2011 Naxalite attack, 10 bodies of policemen were found dismembered in dense forest.61 Despite the major setbacks of 2010–2011, Indian federal and state authorities made some headway against a Naxalite insurgency now generating international headlines.62 Better coordi\u0002nated joint federal-state anti-Naxalite security operations killed a prominent Naxalite military leader, Koteswara Rao, in a November 2011 operation. In 2012 government paramilitary and police operations in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh began to produce results, with more than 1,800 Naxalite insurgents reported arrested and another 440 surrendered during the year.63 In late 2012 several Naxalite regional military leaders were captured and killed in those provinces. Acts of extreme violence continued during 2012 and 2013, but the expanse of the insur\u0002gency began to abate. Insurgency-related fatalities declined in 2012 and remained below 400 in 2013 (table). West Bengal reported sharp declines in Naxalite presence and activities dur\u0002ing 2013, although some observers declared that the decline in those states was offset by a corresponding increase of Naxalite violence in neighboring states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa (appendix A). The Naxalites began the practice of including booby-trapping the bodies of dead Indian soldiers with IEDs in their stomachs. They killed national Congressman, and an\u0002ti-Naxalite militia Salwa Judum founder, Mahendra Karma in an attack on his convoy while he was campaigning for election in rural Chhattisgarh communities. Prime Minister Singh called for a two-pronged approach to dismantle the Naxalite network: sustaining joint and proactive military operations with greater economic development and responsible governance programs in the areas with strongest Maoist support. The CRPF successfully launched a 5-day interstate offensive in late December 2013 to dismantle core Maoist groups.64 It shut down a gun manu- 17 India’s Naxalite Insurgency facturing factory and recovered numerous weapons and explosives. Remote triggering devices were also found, indicating that the insurgency was using more advanced weaponry. By 2014 fatalities from Naxalite violence dropped below 300 for the first time in more than a decade (table). Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh remained most affected by the violence, and some Naxalite groups conducted operations and expanded into southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka states. But a review of the map in 2013 of Naxalite-impacted areas revealed a significant drop in the overall number of affected districts since 2007—from 165 to 120 overall—and an even more significant drop in districts categorized as experiencing severe or moderate amounts of violence from Naxalite activities over the same period—from 69 dis\u0002tricts in 2007 to just 28 in 2013 (see map 3). Eighty percent of Naxalite violence now afflicted only three states of India, down from the nine states impacted by serious Naxalite violence in 2010. On balance the tide had turned. By the end of 2014 the Naxalite insurgency was down if not out.65 In 2015, Indian joint security and economic efforts to counter the remaining Naxalite threat focused on 30 key districts in these 3 most impacted states, enabling more concentrated efforts matching gradually applied paramilitary enforcement with legal reforms and develop\u0002ment activities.66 As in the first two waves of Naxalite insurgency, the Indian federal-state government dis\u0002connect hampered its counterinsurgency efforts throughout the 2000s. Under the Indian con\u0002stitution, states bear the responsibility for enforcing law and order. When required, however, the federal government can send police and—under more limited conditions—military troops. In the case of federal police, assistance can come only upon request from the state government. In the case of military troops, assistance can come in the event of a state of emergency declara\u0002tion—as during the first phase of the Naxalite insurgency. Throughout the period from 2000 to 2010, the federal and state home (interior) ministries supervised multiple police and intelligence agencies without much unity of effort or command. An operation against Naxalite groups in the state of Bihar early in the 2000s faltered. Federal paramilitary border security forces in seven districts helped the local police, and millions of ru\u0002pees were promised in economic development opportunities. But the economic promises were broken, and poorly coordinated security operations only further alienated Naxalite moderates, derailing hoped for results by early 2002. In advance of 2004 elections in Chhattisgarh, the fed\u0002eral government sent 180 companies of paramilitary forces armed with helicopters and other advanced equipment. The Naxalites disappeared. Once the elections were over, federal troops and equipment departed and the Naxalites returned. 18 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 From the 2004 merger of Naxalite groups, the Indian government, particularly at the federal level, applied both carrots and sticks, incentivizing insurgents to pick constitutional remedies and brutally punishing those who refused. But the splits between state and federal authorities limited effectiveness. In part, state and local governments saw themselves in a co\u0002nundrum; they wanted an end to the organized Naxalite violence targeting them, their infra\u0002Map 3. India Naxalite-Affected Districts, 2013 19 India’s Naxalite Insurgency structure, and their legal enforcement structure. However, they did not want to alienate the vote banks across their states who sympathized with the Naxalite view of economic injustice but did not actively participate in violence. In one notable but far from unique instance, the chief minister (or governor) of the Naxalite-wracked state of Jharkhand won election in 2009 with strong insurgent sympathizer and insurgent vote bank support.67 State-level leaders de\u0002sired greater economic support from the central government, not overwhelming force, as the primary means to redress deeply held communist sympathies in their vote constituencies. Na\u0002tional political leaders within the INC empathized with these state-level concerns, offering some economic support and some additional policing support—but too little of either to make significant headway prior to 2010–2011. The politics of left-wing issues and voter concerns made effective coordination of counterinsurgency versus the Naxalites difficult. It took the extensive violence and loss of life between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate the failure of an ill-coordinated approach. In 2009 the central government signaled that it wanted to provide 80,000 paramilitary and federal police to help in the fight, but these were too slowly fed into the region without strong local coordination. From the desperation of the peak year of Naxalite (CPI-Maoist) violence in 2010, and then–Prime Minister Singh’s second declaration that Maoist violence was India’s most grave internal security threat, a combination of state\u0002level requests and federal-level policy improvements paved the way for late-arriving successes against the Naxalites.68 The path to success was also paved by corresponding Naxalite failures. Beginning in 2010, the Indian federal government finally undertook several successful ini\u0002tiatives that slowly but steadily spanned the coordination gap between federal and state security forces and linked with improved local economic development aid.69 First, the government took steps to increase the costs to Maoist insurgent group operations—both financial and physical. Second, the central government deployed an additional 66 federal paramilitary security battal\u0002ions, CPSF and others, into the field where the insurgency had been winning against small and poorly trained local police. As noted above, these came slowly and in tranches between 2010 and 2014 but reached an impressive number of more than 200,000 by early 2014.70 India’s mili\u0002tary and its special operations forces (SOF) have not participated directly in the third phase of Naxalite counterinsurgency operations. Instead, SOF units have provided indirect assistance— offering specialized training to Indian Central Armed Police Forces (see appendix B) preparing to deploy to the anti-Maoist counterinsurgency fight.71 Third, the federal government built 444 new police stations in affected areas and regenerated the policing capability in them.72 Fourth, the government established a civil development program in the worst affected areas. Finally, government security forces worked more effectively in a combined action environment where 20 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 economic development and human rights were established in the communities most vulnerable to Naxalite recruiting and propaganda.73 These five national factors interacted with several organizational failures by the Naxalites themselves. First, the Maoists failed to generate a message of systematic economic exploitation to the degree necessary for serious attention in Indian urban areas, where the gulf between rich and poor was great and growing every year. Second, despite their highly publicized violence, the Naxalites never won the “mindspace” in India; the Maoist ideology of class conflict gener\u0002ated limited appeal outside of primitive and tribal areas in India, never resonating in urban ar\u0002eas other than with a marginalized group of activist university students.74 Indian youth moved onto other causes and other areas of activism in the wider Indian economy.75 Third, Naxalites proved to be their own worst enemies. They often splintered into criminal syndicates deal\u0002ing narcotics and running both extortion and kidnapping rackets. This profiteering, evident from as early as 2009–2010, revealed that Naxalism was less about communist ideology or well-coordinated violent insurgent activity and much more about local and regional organized criminal activity, which exploits rather than benefits the lower class (and lower caste) Indian Hindus who live there.76 In self-reflective statements, ministry-level officials in the Indian federal government ac\u0002knowledged that most Naxalite gains before 2010 had come too often because local govern\u0002ments and security officials incorrectly assessed and mishandled the problems of the disgrun\u0002tled Indian minority groups in rural areas. At the same time the central government remained tepid in its involvement—unable to induce state governments to request more assertive federal security assistance and caught in a political conundrum where some of the state government leadership was both courting Naxalite sympathizer votes while simultaneously fighting Naxalite militant cadres. Once the federal government got serious and increased paramilitary security presence with a wider number of local economic development programs, the Naxalites began to wane.77 Attention to a holistic approach by the Indian central government caused the worst of the Naxalite insurgency to recede in a visible manner.78 In 2016 the Naxalite insurgency in eastern India remains a security factor, but one far from the menace publicly announced by then–Prime Minister Singh in 2006 and again in 2010.79 Instead it is now much more of a nuisance, largely a constellation of organized criminal enter\u0002prises with a loose affiliation to a Maoist credo than an ideological insurgency. The socioeco\u0002nomic factors that inspire Naxalite groups remain in place, and this insurgency could again evolve into a more serious threat to local security agents in India. In the poor eastern districts of India, the possibility of a fourth wave of Naxalite insurgency cannot be dismissed if the rich 21 India’s Naxalite Insurgency continue to get richer without the benefits of economic growth filtering down to the people who really need it.80 India’s long slog toward corralling the third phase of its Naxalite insurgency again demon\u0002strated the challenges and strengths of its counterinsurgency framework. State and local govern\u0002ment police forces must fail obviously and admit to their failures before major federal assistance can come forward. Left-wing (or communist) inspired violence mixes awkwardly with Indian electoral politics in many eastern states of the country. Communist political party voters often sympathize with Naxalite grievances but not their violent means. State and local officials thus have incentives to take uncertain and indecisive action with their police and security forces. Too often, they can tolerate incompetence and even human rights abuses by local-level counterin\u0002surgency police and militias, exacerbating wider grievances. They appeal for national economic help while avoiding national security help out of a fear that too much outside intervention might harm their local political interests. Federal-level forces, when these do arrive, come with their own issues. They can lack local knowledge and fail to be sensitive to popular culture and traditions. This leaves them vulnerable to insurgent ambush and to charges of torture or human rights abuses from an uncertain or frightened local population. U.S. Security Engagement with Indian Ministry of Home Affairs U.S. engagement with India in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has developed over a 16-year period from January 2000. This engagement has advanced along three parallel lines of interaction. One line has been through bilateral dialogue and exercises between U.S. and Indian SOF, which have focused on counterterrorism training events and conversa\u0002tions. A second line has been through collaboration between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Indian Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This collaboration has focused on criminal investigative techniques; port, rail, and maritime security training and best practices; and a general growth in liaison and information exchange between respective special police and border security agencies. A third line of interaction has evolved in more general bilateral military-to-military exchanges between the national armies, navies, air forces, and coast guards. Advancements in each of these areas have been noteworthy but not comprehensive. For all the noteworthy advances, limitations have remained, especially when it comes to the matter of outside assistance for Indian units and organizations conducting domestic counterinsurgency. The history of special operations training and exercising is most noteworthy. Bilateral U.S.- Indian SOF have undertaken joint exercises that work on interoperability in counterterror\u0002ism and counterinsurgency operation skills and drills. Small-scale counterterrorism training 22 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 exercises have been conducted on a recurring basis since 2002, including exercises in India’s northeast territories where longstanding domestic insurgencies continue.81 Under the broad definition of U.S.-India maritime security cooperation, U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) SOF also have been training Indian military special forces officers in counterterrorism, learning from Indian counterterrorism experiences at the same time. In the main, these exercises have focused upon special techniques and capabilities for SOF activities in counterterrorism opera\u0002tions (see appendix C). Despite a decade of offers by U.S. senior commanders and defense officials, Indian leaders declined to have U.S. SOF engage with or provide direct assistance to the MHA paramilitary and police forces optimized for domestic counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations.82 But in October 2015, India, for the first time, welcomed U.S. SOF to a joint training exercise with its MHA counterterrorism unit, the National Security Guards (NSG).83 This was a meaningful step forward and, as most observers believe, became possible only after the change in perspective ac\u0002companying the government of Prime Minister Modi. Yet the limit of U.S. SOF interaction with that of only the NSG—the single special police unit focused on counterterrorism rather than counterinsurgency operations—is telling. After more than a decade of U.S. offers, the Indian government still remains uncomfortable about direct bilateral counterinsurgency training with its large array of MHA domestic counterinsurgency forces. Washington and New Delhi first established the U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Work\u0002ing Group (JWG) in January 2000. Among more than a dozen major steps, the United States and India initiated antiterrorism training programs for Indian law enforcement officials and began a dialogue on cooperation in homeland and internal security.84 First, these programs involved lim\u0002ited military-to-military counterterrorism engagements. Then, after the November 2008 Mum\u0002bai terrorist attack, a more formal set of interactions between DHS and MHA counterterrorism and law enforcement officials began to take shape. Notably, however, neither of these lines of engagement have witnessed the MHA welcoming direct U.S. military or special police assistance for its special police or border police engaged in combating the Naxalite insurgency. In September 2005, USPACOM conducted a counterterrorism tabletop exercise that brought together Indian and American military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitari\u0002an assistance leaders. A U.S. National Guard unit co-trained with Indian troops at India’s Coun\u0002ter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram. U.S. antiterrorism assistance advanced again after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the commercial district of Mumbai. The U.S. Department of State’s Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA) provided enhanced training 23 India’s Naxalite Insurgency consultations with senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials on the topics of hotel security, rail security, responses to an active shooter incident, as well as major event security management.85 In 2010, the two governments began the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Since then the dialogue has enabled bilateral cooperation on mutual strategic interests and strengthened “security cooperation through expanded dialogues and exercises as well as shar\u0002ing of advanced technologies.”86 A subsequent 2010 U.S.-India Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative allows the United States to facilitate capacity-building and training in India across a number of specific areas, including but not limited to: ■ developing investigative skills ■ promoting cooperation between forensic science laboratories ■ establishing procedures to provide mutual investigative assistance ■ improving capabilities to act against money-laundering, counterfeit currency, and terrorist financing ■ trading best practices on mass transit and rail security ■ increasing interactions between coast guards and navies on maritime security ■ exchanging experience and expertise on port and border security ■ enhancing liaison and training between specialist counterterrorism units, including the National Security Guard and its U.S. counterparts.87 Beginning in February 2012, American trainers under the ATA have been training Indian police in cooperation with the MHA. This training includes forensic examination of terrorist crime scenes and advanced explosives incident countermeasures. These courses are also available to state police, for example, in Kolkata (West Bengal). Intelligence agencies of both countries are sharing resources to support specific counterterrorism operations.88 These training courses have had a positive impact upon hundreds of Indian local and national police, including IPS. They have also engaged some members of the MHA special police units such as the Indo-Tibetan Bor\u0002der Police and CPSF. Noteworthy and prudent, these bits of individual training have occurred 24 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 with individual Indian police and paramilitary officers and jawans (junior paramilitary soldiers) who have later participated in counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites and other rebel groups.89 At the same time, though, direct U.S. military engagement with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and security forces units involved in domestic counterinsurgency has remained limited. American military interactions with regular Indian army units also have grown in an im\u0002pressive manner over the past decade. As discussed earlier, Indian, just as American, military and defense leaders are keen to state that India has more joint military training events and exer\u0002cises with the United States than with any other defense partner worldwide.90 Yet India’s civilian defense establishment leadership appears amenable to many military-to-military training and exercise interactions with the United States but continues to view access to military technology to be the litmus test of fruitful bilateral defense relations.91 Although the Indian military highly prizes joint service-to-service interactions and exer\u0002cises, no U.S. military units have been engaged with or even indirectly assisted Indian central police or paramilitary units directly involved in the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations against the Naxalites. In those instances in which the U.S. military and DHS per\u0002sonnel have had interaction with Indian domestic counterinsurgency police and paramilitary forces, the rule has been that indirect general skills training is acceptable for Indian leadership, but specific engagement and activities directly with Indian domestic insurgency forces is alto\u0002gether something else. Some analysts have recommended that the United States formally inject direct domestic counterinsurgency assistance into the U.S.-India security relationship. In 2013, one such ana\u0002lyst, Haider Ali Hussein Mullick, made a robust proposal, stating that the United States should formally generate a $400 million India counterinsurgency initiative, jointly run by the Depart\u0002ment of Defense (DOD), State, and DHS.92 He proposed that this initiative should bundle to\u0002gether the indirect assistance provided by the ATA and DOD International Military Education and Training program, as well as establish a Foreign Military Finance Account for India (where one then did not exist) and apportion other money into DHS and Justice department accounts to better enable Federal Bureau of Information resources for its India-focused international po\u0002lice training program. In this well-intentioned recommendation, U.S. largesse could be used to provide vital equipment to India’s CRPF, including armored personnel vehicles, mine-resistant vehicles, flak jackets, GPS trackers, and night-vision goggles. As Indian attack helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deemed vital for providing counterinsurgency ground 25 India’s Naxalite Insurgency support, this proposal provided for U.S. funding to assist the Indian air force in creating dedi\u0002cated air surveillance and support for the CRPF—including helicopter and UAV support.93 Noble in intent, Mullick’s recommendation of a major U.S. push to provide direct assis\u0002tance to Indian domestic counterinsurgency units and operations remains as misguided today as it was in 2013. Likewise, periodic offers by U.S. defense officials of direct U.S. military assis\u0002tance to Indian counterinsurgency forces are similarly well intentioned but off target.94 These and similar initiatives ultimately push unhelpfully against Indian protection of its absolute sov\u0002ereignty in domestic counterinsurgency operations. Moreover, even if India were to unexpect\u0002edly welcome direct U.S. military and whole-of-government support for its domestic counter\u0002insurgency activities, that very success would create significant problems for the growing but delicate U.S.-India security relationship. These problems are evident in the patterns observed during Indian counterinsurgency operations against the Naxalites. Direct American support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations (such as those against the Naxalites) would quickly expose significant divergence between views in Washington and Indian cultural and political concerns with its domestic insurgents. First, In\u0002dians are historically tolerant of long, protracted counterinsurgency operations, including the four-and-a-half-decade Naxalite rebellion, a six-decade swirl of insurgency in northeast India, and the insurgency and rebellion extant in Jammu and Kashmir since 1947. American patience with such protracted counterinsurgency operations has not been a hallmark of its international ventures over the past century. Second, Indian domestic insurgencies have a political cadence and rhythm about them that is alien to American sensibilities. In all three phases of the Naxalite insurgency, state and local political dynamics played to Naxalite sympathizer vote banks, allowing insurgent activi\u0002ties to grow to an uncomfortable level. In the second phase and especially the third phase of the Naxalite insurgency, Indian national police and paramilitary assistance began with limited but targeted security help for local authorities that focused upon managing major events—like election security—but then quickly vanished. Only when the political calculus of local, state, and national officials aligned did coordinated and effective policing, paramilitary, and local as\u0002sistance programs come together. American patience with the dynamics of this Indian political rhythm would be sorely tried. Third, with much of India’s Naxalite insurgency featuring organized criminal activity as its underpinning by 2014–2016, it is arguably more useful and feasible for the United States and India to focus meaningful collaboration on individual policing techniques and investigative activities to counter these dimensions of residual Naxalism. There will be less Indian resistance 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 to this kind of DHS-to-MHA support. Thereafter, the focus of the U.S. military and its SOF can then better orient on wider regional and international counterterrorism activities. In addition to these historically supported cautions, direct American training and equip\u0002ment support for Indian domestic counterinsurgency operations might run afoul of U.S. legisla\u0002tive mandates and human rights standards. All U.S. assistance to foreign security forces must conform to what is known as the Leahy Law, named for legislative author Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). One part of the law applies to State Department foreign assistance programs and the second applies to DOD training and assistance programs for the security forces of a foreign country. Both versions prohibit any U.S. security assistance if the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense have credible information that a military, paramilitary, or police unit of a foreign government has committed a gross violation of human rights in the conduct of its activities— past or present. The law allows for an exception (or waiver) permitting resumption of security assistance if the Secretary of State or Defense reports to Congress that the government of the assisted country is taking effective steps to bring the violating members of the security forces to justice.95 Direct U.S. assistance to India’s paramilitary and police units combatting the Naxalite insurgency (as others) could quickly run into a problem with the Leahy Law. There have been frequent reports of Indian local police units’ involvement in human rights violations against innocents in the Naxalite insurgency areas.96 Indian central policy forces, including units from the CRPF, have been accused of human rights abuses and torture against apprehended militants and presumed supporters in Naxalite-afflicted areas.97 It is hard to imagine Indian pride react\u0002ing well to American demands for certification of the human rights corrections made on its national counterinsurgency paramilitary forces. It also is hard to imagine the U.S.-India security relationship holding up well if, in order to secure training and equipment for its already well-supported national paramilitary units, New Delhi must face repetitive Leahy Law inquiries. Indeed, in a country with growing wealth and a proud belief in the relative successes of its autonomous, indigenous paramilitary counterin\u0002surgency forces, U.S. direct assistance (with strings) is not likely to be well received.98 At the least, such conditioned assistance would strain security relations that both sides desire to see improve. At the worst, the outcome might set back bilateral security progress on far more im\u0002portant U.S.-India security initiatives including those involving joint maritime security activi\u0002ties in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, interoperability exercises that improve Indian confidence and capabilities against potential Chinese encroachment in disputed border areas, and military-to-military collaboration in global counterterrorism intelligence sharing and broader operations. 27 India’s Naxalite Insurgency Lessons Learned and Policy Implications for U.S.-India Relations A review of the history of Indian approach to dealing with its Naxalite insurgency indi\u0002cates the unique nature of New Delhi’s approach to domestic security. The limited engagement with the United States on military and security assistance offers also indicates the continuing barriers inhibiting a deep and unbridled bilateral security alliance at this time. A decade of U.S. interaction with India on the Naxalite insurgency reinforces the notion that Washington should not expect New Delhi to become a tightly coupled military ally anytime soon. Instead, New Del\u0002hi is more likely to be a friendly strategic partner with the United States where mutual security interests align, while interacting more often in a restrained and limited manner where U.S. and Indian security interests and prerogatives do not well align—as in the case of the Naxalites.99 Given this insight, U.S. policymakers should focus on bilateral counterterrorism and coun\u0002terinsurgency security cooperation efforts toward externally sponsored Islamist terrorist groups and, to the extent that Indian sensitivities will allow, against actions by China that threaten mutually held security concerns. As a complement, U.S. military assistance programs focusing on technical skills and practices for individual Indian police, paramilitary, and SOF will remain most promising and prominent for the foreseeable future. 28 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 Appendix A.

Under the reciprocal agreement, both New Delhi and Washington would have the ability, but not the obligation, to assist each other’s armed forces with simple military logistics. The Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India.

On May 22, there were nearly simultaneous bombings of two movie theaters in New Delhi by a Sikh terrorist organization, Babbar Khalsa International, which many thought was defunct. The attacks left 1 person dead and more than 60 injured. On October 29, a series of explosions in crowded marketplaces and on a public bus in New Delhi killed approximately 60 and injured more than 150 on the eve of Diwali, India’s most important Hindu holiday. The Indian government blamed the designated foreign terrorist organiza\u0002tion Lashkar e-Tayyiba for the attack.

But it also came about after Naxalite groups began to focus on controlling areas rich in natural resources such as iron and destroying state infrastructure such as railroads, telephone exchanges, and industrial plants. By 2010 Naxalite presence overlapped critical areas such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Orissa, which contain the bulk of India’s iron ore, and Andhra Pradesh has large reserves of bauxite, 38 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 key inputs to Indian industry. Naxalites had also come to dominate areas containing 85 percent of the country’s coal resources, which are used to power 55 percent of India’s energy supply and 75 percent of its electricity. These economic realities made piecemeal solutions and state-level toleration of Naxalite activities untenable—driving better coordination. See “Left Wing Extremism (LWE) Division,” available at.

These offers have been politely declined by mid\u0002level Indian Ministry of Defence and MHA leaders. 94 “Leahy Fact Sheet,” Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights & Labor, March 3, 2016, available at. 95 “India: Draconian Response to Naxalite Violence,” Human Rights Watch, April 27, 2006, available at; Azaan Javaid, “Maharashtra Police Used to Torture Me: JNU Student Hem Mishra,” DNAIndia.com, September 27, 2015, available at. 40 Strategic Perspectives, No. 22 96 Verma, 307, 313; “CRPF Personnel Death in Naxal No Human Rights Violation,” Busi\u0002nessStandard.com, May 25, 2014, available at. 97 Well-intentioned, but ill-timed conditionality on U.S. security assistance has harmed bilateral relations with aspiring strategic partners in several historic instances. Most recently, U.S. congressional conditionality on the Kerry-Berman-Lugar strategic assistance package to Pakistan of 2009 requiring that Pakistan’s military relinquish absolute control of its general officer selection process to civilian oversight substantially strained U.S.-Pakistan relations at a moment that Washington aimed to make them tighter. India in 2016 is not Pakistan of 2009, but the caution against unhelpful conditionality remains a worthy one. See S. 1707, “Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009,” 111th Cong., 1st sess.

SFs recovered one AK47 rifle, one Light Machine Gun (LMG) and explosives from the encounter spot. The identities of the slain Maoists are yet to be ascertained. On April 5, 2024, one CPI-Maoist cadre was gunned down by SFs in the forest area near Kirandul in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. During the search, SFs recovered the dead body of the Maoist, his weapon and explosives from the encounter site. On April 2, 2024, 13 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in a forest near Lendra village under the Gangaloor Police Station limits of the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh. The identity of the dead Maoists was yet to be ascertained, but _prima facie_, it appeared that they belonged to the Maoist’s PLGA (People's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Company No. 2, a senior Police official disclosed. Police recovered weapons, including a Light Machine Gun (LMG), a .303 rifle, and a 12-bore gun, along with a substantial quantity of barrel grenade launchers, shells, and other arms and ammunition, from the site. On April 1, 2024, two CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with security personnel in the Kerajhari Forest of the Balaghat District in Madhya Pradesh. The Police recovered the bodies of 38-year-old Maoist ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ Sajanti _aka_ Kranti and ‘area committee member (ACM)’ Raghu _aka_ Sher Singh (54), both were wanted in multiple cases of murder, kidnapping, and arson, with bounty announcements by the Police in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Elsewhere on the same day, one CPI-Maoist cadre was killed in an encounter with SFs in the forest area near Tetemadgu village under Kistaram Police Station limits in the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh. The dead body of the Maoist and his weapons were recovered from the encounter site. The identity of the slain Maoist is yet to be ascertained. According to partial data compiled by the _South Asia Terrorism Portal_ (SATP), at least 58 _Naxalites_ \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] have been killed by the SFs during the current year, 2024 (data till April 7). During the corresponding period of 2023, SFs had eliminated nine _Naxalites_. Through 2023, SFs killed 58 _Naxalites_, in addition to 67 killed in 2022. According to the SATP database, SFs arrested 401 _Naxalites_ in 2023 as against 395 arrests in 2022. In 2024, as on April 7, the number of arrests stood at 92. Since March 6, 2000, according to SATP data, 16,364 _Naxalites_ have been arrested (data till April 7, 2024). Through 2023, SFs recovered weapons and ammunition from the Maoists in 223 incidents, in addition to 193 such incidents of recovery in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the number of such incidents was 58. Since March 6, 2000, a total of 4,917 incidents of arms recovery are on record. Mounting pressure on the _Naxalites_ has resulted in a large number of surrenders over the past few years. According to SATP data, at least 254 _Naxalites_ surrender through 2023, in addition to 2,855 surrenders in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, 42 surrenders have been recorded. Since March 6, 2000, 16,780 _Naxalites_ have surrendered (data till April 7, 2024). Continuing SF successes on the ground further improved the overall security situation through 2023. The trend of declining overall fatalities, on year-on-year basis, in Left Wing Extremism-related violence, has been established since 2018, though a marginal reversal occurred in 2023 at around 11.11 per cent (from 135 in 2022 to 150 in 2023). According to SATP data, a total of 150 people (61 civilians, 31 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_) were killed in such violence through 2023, as against 135 fatalities (53 civilians, 15 SF personnel and 67 _Naxalites_) recorded in 2022. During the current year, as on April 7, 2024, the total number of such fatalities stood at 93 (22 civilians, 13 SF personnel and 58 _Naxalites_), as against 37 such fatalities (19 civilians, nine SF personnel and nine _Naxalites_) reported during the corresponding period of 2023. According to SATP data, the number of civilian fatalities (61) recorded through 2023 was the third lowest in this category since 2000. Two other previous lows were recorded at 53 in 2022 and 58 in 2021. A third low of 61 was also recorded in 2020. The maximum number of civilians killed in such violence, 630, was in 2010. Though the number of fatalities among SFs increased from 15 in 2022 to 31 in 2023, according to SATP data, the number of fatalities in 2023 was the second lowest in this category since 2000. A previous low of 15 was recorded in 2022. The maximum number of SFs killed in such violence, 319, was in 2009. The SF:Maoist kill ratio remained in favour of the SFs in 2023, at 1:1.87, improving the ratio in favour of the SFs in 2011, when it was at 1:1.53. In 2022, the ratio was at 1:4.46, surpassing the previous best of 1:4.03 in 2016. In 2010, the SF:Maoist kill ratio shifted to 1.01:1, favouring the Maoists. Also, in 2009 the ratio was at 1.01:1. In 2007, the ratio was at 1.2:1 favouring the Maoists. However, since March 6, 2000, the overall kill ratio has been in favour of the SFs (1:1.63). In the current year, the kill ratio remains in favour of the SFs at 1:4.46, so far (data till April 7, 2024). Other parameters of violence indicate that, despite sustained SF pressure, the Maoists but retain significant operational capabilities across the country. At least eight major incidents (each involving three or more fatalities) were recorded in 2023, compared to seven such incidents in 2022. There were 89 incidents of exchange of fire between SFs and Maoist in 2023, compared to 86 such incidents in 2022. Further, the Maoists orchestrated at least 62 incidents of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in 2023, compared to 32 such incidents in 2022. Moreover, the number of overall LWE-linked incidents of violence increased marginally from 602 in 2022 to 603 in 2023. In particular, incidents in which the Maoists killed civilians and SFs increased from 63 in 2022 to 77 in 2023. Meanwhile, according to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from 12 States in 2023, in comparison to 10 States in 2022. (India has a total of 797 Districts in 29 States and nine Union Territories). The 12 affected States have a total of 83 Districts which recorded a Maoist presence. Of these, seven districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category; 20 in the ‘moderately affected’ category; and 56 were ‘marginally affected’. By comparison in 2022, of 57 affected districts from 10 states, two districts fell in the ‘highly affected’ category, 28 in the ‘moderately affected’ category, and 27 were ‘marginally affected’. However, in a written reply to a question in the _Rajya Sabha_ (Upper House of the Indian Parliament) on February 7, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai claimed that the resolute implementation of the “National Policy and Action Plan (NPAP) to address LWE” approved in 2015, resulted in a consistent decline in violence and constriction of the geographical spread of LWE influence. LWE-related violence and resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) declined by 73 per cent from a high in 2010, by 90 per cent in 2022, and by 86 per cent in 2023. Further, Rai stated that the number of Police Stations reporting LWE-related violence had reduced significantly, from 465 Police Stations across 96 districts in 2010 to 176 Police Stations across 45 districts in 2022 and 171 Police Stations across 42 districts in 2023. Clearly, all major LWE-affected states across the country – see Andhra Pradesh’s **[Residual Vexations](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-29#assessment2)**, Bihar’s **[Halted Menace](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-35#assessment2)**, Chhattisgarh’s **[Persisting Disruptions](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-33#assessment2)**, Jharkhand’s **[Risks amidst decline](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-31#assessment2)**, Madhya Pradesh’s **[Enduring Risks](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-41#assessment2)**, Maharashtra’s **[Ineffective ‘Revival’](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-36#assessment2)**, Odisha’s **[Enduring challenges](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-34#assessment2)**, and Telangana’s **[Sustained Dominance](https://www.satp.org/south-asia-intelligence-review-Volume-22-No-37#assessment2)** have recorded substantial improvement in the security situation in the regions affected by LWE activity. Earlier, on January 21, 2024, the union home minister (UHM) Amit Shah, had asserted that the country would be free from the menace of _Naxalism_ in the next three years, and directed states to expedite development activities in remote areas affected by the ultras. UHM Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras and instructed officials to prepare a blueprint to end _Naxalism_. He also stressed the need for expediting development in _Naxalite_-affected areas, asserting that all welfare schemes of the central and state governments would have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. Meanwhile, on January 11, 2024, the Chhattisgarh government invited Maoists to hold unconditional talks, suggesting \"video calls if they are reluctant to come for physical meetings\". Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who holds the state's Home portfolio, stating that this would be a step towards restoring peace and stability in the Bastar region, thus observed, | | | --- | | We are prepared to provide Naxalites an online platform to express their grievances, ideas and desires. I am open to discussions with the young cadres any time, 24x7, without any conditions. I am available for any topic the Naxalites wish to discuss, but they must be willing to engage. If they regret their decision to join the outfit or wish to reintegrate with mainstream society, I extend my hand to them and urge them to lead a peaceful life and serve the country. | While holding out an olive branch, the Government made it clear that there would be no softening of stance. The Deputy Chief Minister thus warned, | | | --- | | If they fail to grasp the importance of dialogue, they will have to pay for the pain they have inflicted on our people ('dard ka hisaab hoga'). They must understand that peace talks cannot occur with guns and bullets. A well-ordered society is not governed by firearms. We want to discuss what they desire, why they carry weapons, why they mislead and trouble people, why they oppose progress in villages, and why they do not support the establishment of hospitals, schools, water facilities, and _anganwadis_. | Meanwhile, according to a March 21, 2024, media report, Chhattisgarh's Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma's call for unconditional dialogue with Maoists prompted a response from the CPI-Maoist, with the rebels presenting certain preconditions and emphasizing the necessity of a conducive environment for talks to ensure the welfare and lasting peace of oppressed and exploited segments of society. In a letter, CPI-Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) 'spokesman' Vikalp outlined several conditions before any agreement could be reached to engage in dialogue. These conditions included the cessation of atrocities and false encounters on tribals, halting militarization in tribal regions, withdrawing security forces, and annulling agreements with corporate entities. In a two-page letter dated March 15, 2024, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp declared that, if their demands were met, they would be ready to engage in dialogue via mobile phone calls. He noted, further, | | | --- | | We had previously responded to the invitation for talks, stating that our central agenda is none other than the overall development of the oppressed and harassed sections of society, including tribal, Dalit, Muslim, and minority communities, as well as farmers, women, and the middle class. Additionally, we advocate for equal pay for equal work based on gender equality and an end to state violence against women. | Vikalp also insisted on providing loan waivers for farmers, increasing agricultural subsidies, providing free irrigation and electricity, cancelling agreements with international companies, and implementing welfare schemes such as free education, housing, healthcare, and employment. The Maoists thus gave _bandh_ (general shut down strike) calls on their whims. In their latest call on March 30, 2024, the Maoists called for a _bandh_ in Bijapur and Sukma on April 3, 2024, to protest the killing of six Maoists in an encounter in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh on March 27, 2024, which the rebels claimed was a \"fake encounter\". However, the _bandh_ calls were peaceful. Rejecting the allegations of fake encounters as \"old tactics\" of the Maoists, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar range, Sundarraj P., asserted, | | | --- | | It is the typical _modus operandi_ of Maoists to level allegations against the security forces to puncture the credibility of security forces. Maoists conveniently forget that they are responsible for brutal killings of hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians. Just to distract the attention from their inhumane behaviour, they issue these kinds of statements. All concerned understand the reality that the Maoists are facing their extinction. | Earlier, on March 26, 2024, Mohan, the ‘secretary’ of the CPI-Maoist West Bastar Division Committee, had issued a press note which announced that Bijapur would remain closed on March 30. In the note the Maoist leader accused the Police of killing 15 tribals since January. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Chhattisgarh has been accused of fake encounters, atrocities, and the eviction of tribals from forests and land, and denial of access to water resources. The Maoists warned transporters and businessmen that they would be responsible if they operated on March 30. However, the _bandh_ passed without any disruptive activities. The Maoists issued nine _Bandh_ calls in 2023 across the country, as against eight such calls in 2022. The Maoist movement has weakened, as the SFs now increasingly dominate areas long under LWE sway. Nevertheless, the capacities to sustain dominance remain limited. According to _Bureau of Police Research and Development_ (BPR&D) data, the all-India Police-population ratio was 152.80 (as on January 1, 2022), in comparison to 152.51 per 100,000 on January 1, 2021. Some of the Maoists’ affected States have much worse police-population ratios: Bihar, at 75.16; Odisha at 122.59; and Maharashtra at 136.45. Even in States like Jharkhand, where the police-population ratio, at 162.73, exceeds the national average, it remains much lower than the 220/100,000 ratio regarded as desirable for 'peacetime policing'. Moreover, there were 504 (17.59 per cent) vacancies in the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) in the 12 affected States, considerably weakening executive direction of the Force. Further, huge vacancies persist in the total strength of the State Police forces, which have been increasingly used in the fight against the _Naxalites_: there were 417,784 vacant posts in the 12 affected States, as on January 1, 2022, against a sanctioned strength of 1,642,759 (actual strength: 1,224,965). Significantly, these constituted 72.3 per cent of the 595,105 vacant posts across India, as on January 1, 2022. Moreover, against a sanctioned strength of 324,654 in the CRPF, the lead counter-insurgency Force in the country, the actual strength stood at 309,544, a vacancy of 15,110 personnel. Stark deficits are visible in some of the worst afflicted States. According to BPR&D data, as on January 1, 2022, there were at least 22 Police Stations in Chhattisgarh, the worst _Naxalism_-affected State, which did not have a telephone. Similarly, the second worst affected State, Jharkhand, had 211 such Police Stations without telephone connections. The number of Police Stations without a vehicle in Jharkhand was 47, while 31 Police stations in the state hand no wireless/mobile phone. The Maoists are certainly losing their impact across the country; however, the danger of resurgence remains alive. There is urgent need to build the necessary capacities to sustain, indeed, heighten pressure at this stage, in order to consolidate the gains of recent years. | [Assessments Year

On June 15, 2020, troops on the Sino-Indian border engaged in their most violent confrontation in decades, endangering the precariously maintained peace between the two Asian giants. The scuffle took place in the Galwan Valley on the western sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that delineates the _de facto_ border between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Strategically located between the Indian Union Territory of Ladakh on the West and Aksai Chin (the Chinese-controlled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) on the East, this section of territory sits 14,000 feet above sea level in the high Himalayas, making it one of the most formidable and inaccessible battlefields. In line with long-standing practices and confidence-building measures, including agreements of 1996 and 2005, border troops on both sides are under orders to avoid the use of firearms and encourage restraint upon any encounters along the contested LAC.\\[1\\] As a result, the clash along the steep gorges of Galwan was hand-to-hand combat involving barbed-wire fence posts, nail-studded iron batons, jagged rocks, and fists left 20 soldiers dead on the Indian side with “unspecified casualties” on the Chinese front.\\[2\\] Since May this year, tension has been mounting on the LAC, but there were hopes of returning to the status quo ante through disengagement talks that began on June 06. However, with death in Galwan, Xi’s China and Modi’s India, the two great power aspirants with nationalist leaders at the helm, have only inched closer to the point of no return.\\[3\\] This insight analyses the destabilizing power nexus in South Asia, presenting consequences to be looked out for as this multifaceted conflict spills beyond Asia. The LAC has historically been a cause of strained relations between India and China. Each side accuses the other of surprise maneuvers, infrastructural activities, and incursions to unilaterally alter the 3,488-kilometer-long undemarcated border. China’s ingresses into Chumar, Depsang plains, Daulat Beg Oldi, and other sensitive frontiers have resulted in multiple deadlocks with India in the last decade, including a 73-day stand-off over Chinese construction on the disputed Doklam plateau, at the critical India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. At the apogee of an ersatz relationship between the Tiger and the Dragon, the latest developments along the LAC have heightened the India-China security dilemma.\\[4\\] **_Figure 1: Developments along the contested LAC_**\\[5\\] ![China and India border conflict image 1](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-and-India-border-conflict-image-1-1024x511.jpg) **Source: _Maxar Technologies via_** [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CHINA/BORDER/bdwpkadxqpm/index.html) As it stands, recent satellite imagery by Maxar has revealed an amassing of Chinese forces, armored convoys, heavy construction machinery, and structural expansion with possible fortification close to new configurations potentially resembling defensive barricades on the Indian side.\\[6\\] The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has made a further approach to the banks of Pangong Tso, a flashpoint for the two countries since the first Sino-Indian war of 1962.\\[7\\] New Delhi has found itself a new dilemma in China’s abrasive and confrontational tactics, announcing its intent in a declaration of unambiguous sovereignty over Galwan.\\[8\\] India’s protest in denying Beijing’s claims as “exaggerated and untenable” is backed by its offensive preparedness, signaling worry for conflict watchers.\\[9\\] India has deployed its T-90 Bhishma tanks and C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules, and CH-47 Chinook aircraft near the LAC. It also test-bedded the offensive capabilities of its sophisticated XVII Corps and Integrated Battle Groups along the Eastern Front of the LAC last October. The world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, an India-Russia venture, also received combat-clearance amid the India-China row.\\[10\\] Guided by Prime Minister Modi’s “clarion call for _Atmanirbhar Bharat”_ (self-reliant India), the Ministry of Defence approved the upgrade of 59 MIG-29s and the procurement of 21 MiG-29s and 12 Su-30MKIs, an investment exceeding $5.2 billion to bolster its combat squadrons.\\[11\\] However, it should also be noted that India’s active development of its military capabilities in recent years has been outstripped by China. According to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China has increased its military expenditure by 85 percent in the last decade, ranking as the second-highest spender in the world in 2019, with India following closely in third place.\\[12\\] **_Figure 2: China’s nuclear strike range (left) in comparison with India’s nuclear strike range_** **_(right) – estimations of capabilities and positions based on research at the Belfer Center_** | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China.jpg) **Map Legend: China** | | ![](http://trendsresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/India.jpg) **Map Legend: India** | | **Missile Type** | **Rocket Force Base and Location** | **Color** **(of circle)** | **Approx.

The Naresh Chandra Committee, a high-level task force assembled to assess India’s national security environment in 2011, presciently warned of China’s “containment of India,” the modernization of the PLA and its “growing assertiveness on the border”, and recommended a shift of India’s national security strategy from Islamabad to Beijing.\\[15\\] China’s unchecked maritime advance, especially its stronghold of critical Sea Lines of Communication or “string of pearls” that encircle India, has been a long-standing concern for India’s security elite. Listed under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s development of ports from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan to Kenya threatens India’s peninsular advantage in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This advantage includes its ability to control China’s energy chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, a hindrance to China’s power projection. In the past, India has exploited what former President Hu Jintao designated as China’s “Malacca dilemma,” by threatening to close off access in case of Beijing’s interference in the critical Indo-Pakistan wars of 1971 and 1999. Positioning itself as a worthy competitor and challenger, India has increased naval surveillance in the IOR in the last week. It has also conducted a joint exercise with Japan, one of the four security allies of “the quad”, the security dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (US). Another reason Beijing’s ambitions cannot fit well within a cooperative model with India is that they cut right through India’s nationalism, the soul of which lies in Kashmir. A large part of India’s boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, constitute areas occupied by China or ceded to it by Pakistan in a bilateral boundary agreement reached in 1963, much to India’s dismay. When BRI’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), laid plans to pass through Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India became acutely aware of the threat that this evolving partnership would pose to its strategic positioning in Asia. There is a cautious optimism behind India’s doctrine of “strategic autonomy”. It is designed to maintain the power asymmetry in the South Asian neighborhood but wielded to seek “equivalence” with the great powers — China, Russia, US — in a multipolar world.\\[16\\] On the domestic front, the Modi government has prospered through a vociferous policy of strong and secure borders and a muscular international approach, which was more readily evident in the rhetoric with Pakistan than with China. In view of Modi’s party and support the base’s nationalist ideology, there is tremendous pressure on India to respond with a heavy hand.\\[17\\] Citing the national intelligence law, India has banned nearly 60 Chinese apps, including TikTok, in a move analysts deem “techno-nationalism”.\\[18\\] However, the potential of economic retaliation and decoupling seems thin, given India’s dependence on China for its manufacturing, consumer electronics, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries. While India’s military capabilities have undoubtedly advanced in the years building up to the latest LAC clashes, there remains a considerable imbalance between the two Asian powers. Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is from $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. **_Table 1: An assessment of India and China’s relative military capabilities_**.\\[19\\] | **Military Strength** | **India** | **China** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Tanks** | 4292 | 3500 | | **Armored Vehicles** | 8686 | 33000 | | **Self-propelled Artillery** | 235 | 3800 | | **Fighter Jets** | 538 | 1232 | | **Naval Frigates** | 13 | 52 | | **Corvettes** | 19 | 50 | | **Patrol Vessels** | 139 | 220 | Despite their close rankings, China’s expenditure on firepower is anywhere in the region of $177 to $261 billion, overshadowing India’s $71 billion. Commensurate to China’s 3,500 tanks, 33,000 armored vehicles, 1,232 fighter jets, 52 naval frigates, and 220 patrol vessels, the Indian arsenal holds 4,292 tanks, 8,686 armored vehicles, 538 fighter jets, 13 frigates, and 139 patrol vessels.\\[20\\] Since the 1990s, both powers have demonstrated greater urgency in competing one-another in border infrastructural capabilities, and as the roads close in nearer to the LAC, the prospects for cooperation have been further reduced. The _modus vivendi_ maintained between India and China for over half a century has come to a crescendo in Galwan accompanied by the end of a “peaceful rise” of China, as argued by Dr. Shashi Tharoor, former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs.\\[21\\] At the vertex of a power imbalance in South Asia, India can neither afford an all-out war with China nor indulge its salami-slicing tactics (frequent, limited actions) along the world’s longest unmarked border. As it weighs its choices, India has to be careful not to act in acquiescence. While relative economic and military imbalances may limit India’s options, proactive and strategic foreign policy positioning could help maintain its regional position. Taking inspiration from Richard N. Haass, American diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, India must consider that robust foreign policy is built on a solid domestic foundation.\\[22\\] Beyond a duel of rivals, the South Asian conflict exemplifies a contest between an unchecked, undeterred Communist Party of China and the democracy that India has strived to maintain. India’s strongest advantage over China still lies in its democracy, if it chooses to leverage it. There has never been a greater need for India to reach an all-party consensus and project a united front based on historical wisdom and future aspirations.\\[23\\] Internally made concessions to bridge political divides across party lines will always be cheaper than concessions made to an actor beyond borderlines. **The Asian Nexus: Why neighbors matter in South Asia** Security analysts are divided on India’s preparedness in responding to what cannot be considered a black swan moment on the LAC.\\[24\\] However, in debating its riposte, India is at risk of neglecting its neighbors. While there are laudable achievements under India’s “Neighborhood First” policy, including the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) framework, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), ineffective implementation, and unsustained momentum have impeded New Delhi’s ability to realize the full potential of these initiatives.\\[25\\] At the same time, China has made inroads into South Asian affairs, securing economic, diplomatic, and security ties in the neighborhood. As Derek Grossman contends, China has greatly leveraged the BRI to its geostrategic advantage, taking over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port on a 99-year lease, signing off Nepal’s stance on Tibet through 20 BRI agreements, parading the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” as an incentive of Chinese partnership and, ultimately, by giving Pakistan an unconditional alliance that would keep India on guard.\\[26\\] Bandwagoning and balancing within the region have been critical to the maintenance of the Indo-China nexus in South Asia, but it has become increasingly evident that the pursuit of the “Asian Century” may only be fulfilled through an Asian monopoly led by China.\\[27\\] India’s geographical vulnerability lies in the Siliguri corridor, the 22-kilometer-wide “chicken’s neck” connecting its North-Eastern states with the mainland. Had the 2017 confrontation wherein China sought to claim a section of Doklam disputed with Bhutan tilted in China’s favor, it would have secured a critical advantage over this corridor. Owing to New Delhi’s strong ties with Bhutan, the stand-off was mitigated to India’s advantage. The same support cannot be asked of its other regional ”partners” with interdependent geographies. Bangladesh’s deafening silence on the border crisis owes much to its discomposure with India over the latter’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that looks to award citizenship only to persecuted non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though a neighbor that India has shared deep structural, institutional, and historical ties with, Bangladesh is instead focusing on the tariff exemption offered to it by China on 97 percent of its exports. Dhaka is further rebuking Indian media for its deprecatory coverage of the growing links with Beijing. In May, India inaugurated an 80-kilometer road stretching up to the Lipulekh Pass on China’s border, at their Nepal tri-junction. A claimant to the territory, Nepal chose strong retaliation over precedents of past dialogues, moving to amend its constitution and national emblem to incorporate the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura.\\[28\\] As influence within the regional nexus slips away from India, it must act substantively and closely with its “like-minded partners” in South Asia to provide them with support and thereby counter-balance Chinese incursions into the region.\\[29\\] Alliances forged both internally and regionally will be key to India’s diplomatic counter-offensive. **Conclusion** The skirmishes that took place at the LAC has undeniably transgressed into the realpolitik of great power competition, altering the South Asian _status quo_ with limited possibilities of return. This insight ultimately concludes with three assertions: - First, on the question of war – for India, in its balance between epidemiology to meet the current pandemic and military escalations, the cost of war is high. Rajesh Rajagopalan, however, argues that the cost of inaction will be higher in the long-term as it will signal India’s irresolution and embolden China, wherein the latter will only accept an unambiguous victory.\\[30\\] However, the facts of China’s assertion of power over Hong Kong, pushback on the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, trade disputes with Australia, unflinching position vis-à-vis the US, brazen ascent in South Asia with its debt-trap maneuvers, “wolf-warrior diplomacy”, and, finally, its forward advance on the LAC, only go to show that China has everything to gain and India much to lose. - Second, on opportunities for India – the conflict comes when India is offering itself as an assertive yet reliable ally in the multipolar world. Its “NORMS — New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System” approach won it 184 of 192 votes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an important step in India’s quest to secure a permanent seat on the body. The Indo-China conflict thus can be an opportunity for India to concretize its strategic autonomy, defining it normatively as a foreign policy player promoting respect for international law, diplomatic dialogue, and a transparent rise as a leading regional actor. In this crucial game, India can decide what type of power it chooses to emerge as, and this could be an opportunity to project itself as a legitimate and putative great power that China could not be. While demonstrating its power on the LAC, India should simultaneously act regionally to balance disagreements by employing diplomatic tact – an approach in which it has historically maintained an edge over China – to (re)manifest its soft power and put its economic weight behind narratives of shared civilizational legacies in the IOR. An example of the latter is the development of Project SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region). - Third, on consequences beyond South Asia – India’s soft balancing should be matched by an impetus from its allies for external balancing. A unipolar South Asia built on an unrelenting China will not augur well for the West. While the Indo-Pakistan conflict has played to the advantage of the US and Europe, especially during the Cold War, the same expectation cannot be held from the Indo-China dispute. Against the background of US-China tensions, the latter’s unchecked rise in South Asia will be detrimental to the influence that the former has previously enjoyed. With a weakened India, expanded economic influence in South Asia, and Pakistan committed to its Chinese “iron brother”, Beijing will seek to negate Western ideological and economic influence in the region. Those concerned about China’s increasingly assertive policies would expect the West, in particular Washington, to protect their interests through measures such as mobilization of the Quad and other regional networks, notably the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By assessing the larger complications for South Asia emerging from developments on India’s disputed border with China, this insight has also discussed how consequential the dispute might be for the rest of the world if the undertones of the changing competition are not structurally tackled. In the _Art of War_, Sun Tzu posits, “a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.”\\[31\\] In their international positioning, whether it will be India or China’s thinking and preparedness that is victorious, only the real geopolitical battle will tell — one that far exceeds the LAC battlegrounds. * * * **References** [_**\\[1\\]**_](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/india-china-standoff-from-precarious-peace-to-the-point-of-no-return/?srsltid=AfmBOorD5qivlKr2EDLlPurrKrB1Tr759R_oZtMzJq_UPkH-xwZw139I#_ednref1) _Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas, New Delhi, November 29, 1996, United Nations Peacemaker, available from_( [https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%20IN\\_961129\\_Agreement%20between%20China%20and%20India.pdf](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/CN%2520IN_961129_Agreement%2520between%2520China%2520and%2520India.pdf)).

    "full_text": "# RedNovember Targets Government, Defense, and Technology Organizations _Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was July 25, 2025_ ## Executive Summary In July 2024, Insikt Group publicly [reported](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on TAG-100, a threat activity group conducting suspected cyber-espionage activity targeting high-profile government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally using the open-source, multi-platform Go backdoor Pantegana. At the time, we did not attribute this activity to a particular country; however, after reviewing all available evidence, we assess that TAG-100 is highly likely a Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group. Accordingly, Insikt Group now tracks this group under the designation RedNovember. Between June 2024 and July 2025, RedNovember (which overlaps with Storm-2077) targeted perimeter appliances of high-profile organizations globally and used the Go-based backdoor Pantegana and Cobalt Strike as part of its intrusions. The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified new likely victims, which include a ministry of foreign affairs in central Asia, a state security organization in Africa, a European government directorate, and a Southeast Asian government. RedNovember also likely compromised at least two United States (US) defense contractors, a European engine manufacturer, and a trade-focused intergovernmental cooperation body in Southeast Asia. We observed RedNovember reconnoitering and likely compromising edge devices for initial access, including SonicWall, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), F5 BIG-IP, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, Sophos SSL VPN, and Fortinet FortiGate instances, as well as Outlook Web Access (OWA) instances and Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN appliances. RedNovember’s activity exemplifies the ability to combine weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits with open-source post-exploitation frameworks such as Pantegana, lowering the entry barrier for less-capable threat actors. It also allows higher-tier groups to refrain from using customized tools during operations in which they are less concerned with being detected or in which heightened attribution obfuscation is desirable. Insikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded Future's notification policy. ## Key Findings - RedNovember continues to rely on command-and-control (C2) frameworks (Pantegana and Cobalt Strike) and open-source backdoors (SparkRAT) for its operations. - The threat group has significantly broadened its targeting, including by conducting spearphishing and vulnerability exploitation attempts against entities in the US Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and space organizations in Europe. - At least some of the RedNovember activity that Insikt Group observed, including in Taiwan and Panama, took place in close proximity to geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China. - RedNovember has also increasingly focused its initial access efforts on targeting edge devices, including security solutions such as VPNs, firewalls, load balancers, virtualization infrastructure, and email servers. - In April 2025, the threat group conducted a campaign focused on the reconnaissance and targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices across multiple countries. Specific targets included a major US newspaper and a specialized US engineering and military contractor. ## Background RedNovember (previously tracked as TAG-100 and overlapping with Storm-2077) is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage group that leverages open-source tools and exploits internet-facing devices to target government, intergovernmental, and private sector organizations globally. Insikt Group has previously publicly [reported](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on RedNovember’s use of the multi-platform Go-based backdoor Pantegana and other offensive security tools, including Cobalt Strike and SparkRAT, coupled with exploitation of perimeter appliances, to conduct reconnaissance, initial access, and probable compromise activities. RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution, a tactic that aligns with broader state-sponsored cyber-espionage trends that Insikt Group has observed. Combining weaponized proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits and open-source tools enables RedNovember to operate at scale. RedNovember’s activity highlights the persistent vulnerabilities of perimeter devices, which remain a significant risk vector due to limited visibility and logging capabilities. RedNovember is one of multiple [other](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf) Chinese state-sponsored threat groups that are increasingly achieving initial access to targets by targeting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices, including security products. Targeting internet-facing devices has proven to be an effective way for Chinese state-sponsored threat groups to scale initial access and achieve initial footholds in large numbers of organizations ahead of more targeted follow-on activity. ## Technical Analysis Since our initial [public report](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0716.pdf) on its activity, RedNovember has continued to use the Pantegana C2 framework and Cobalt Strike as part of its intrusion activity. From our visibility and collection, RedNovember also highly likely continues to use ExpressVPN to administer its servers and may, with realistic probability, have started using other VPNs such as Warp VPN to remotely connect to its infrastructure. **_Figure 1:_** _Overview of RedNovember operations (Source: Recorded Future)_ While monitoring RedNovember’s active C2 servers, Insikt Group observed a number of victims on a global scale across the public and private sectors, but concentrated in the following verticals: aerospace and defense, government, and professional services. In addition to suspected compromise activity by RedNovember, we observed other network communications between multiple organizations and C2 servers associated with RedNovember, likely reflecting, at a minimum, general browsing activity and potentially reconnaissance efforts by the threat group. While the activity could be indicative of an intent to compromise, in these cases, there is currently insufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. The terms “compromise,” “targeting,” “reconnaissance,” and “browsing\" are used specifically throughout this report to clarify the kind of activity observed. For example, where we assess that RedNovember compromised an entity, we will use terms such as “compromise” and “victim.” ### Victimology, Targeting, and Reconnaissance Between H2 2024 and H2 2025, RedNovember compromised, targeted, and reconnoitered organizations on a global scale. In particular, RedNovember heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, and, in April 2025, it focused its reconnaissance on over 30 Panamanian government organizations. **_Figure 2:_** _Mapping of countries with organizations compromised or targeted by RedNovember (Source: Recorded Future)_ #### Targeting of Government, Intergovernmental, and Diplomatic Entities RedNovember has targeted government and diplomatic organizations across many countries, as well as intergovernmental organizations. Insikt Group has identified the likely targeting of Outlook Web Access (OWA) portals belonging to a South American country prior to that country's state visit to China. Similar RedNovember activity has been observed targeting OWA portals belonging to ministries of foreign affairs in Southeast Asia and South America. Since at least mid-2024, RedNovember has highly likely compromised the following targets: - A 3CX web client instance associated with the ministry responsible for museums in a western European country - A Zimbra Collaboration Suite server associated with a Southeast Asian country - A Fortinet FortiGate appliance likely associated with the foreign affairs ministry of an East Asian country - A Huawei router likely associated with a Southeast Asian government - An African government’s Cisco ASA appliance Insikt Group also observed communications suggesting a long-running compromise of an intergovernmental organization based in Southeast Asia at least up until March 2025. Other Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, including RedDelta, have previously targeted official intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia, likely for the purposes of espionage. Additionally, in March and April 2025, Insikt Group observed evidence suggesting the likely compromise of an additional intergovernmental organization based in Southeast Asia. ##### Taiwan Between December 9, 2024, and December 16, 2024, Insikt Group observed communications from a RedNovember malicious server, _198\\[.\\]98\\[.\\]50\\[.\\]218_, also hosting a Pantegana C2, to a location in Taiwan that is home to a Taiwan Air Force military airbase and is also a primary location for semiconductor research and development. On December 9, 2024, China [conducted](https://www.dw.com/en/china-breaks-silence-on-large-military-drills-around-taiwan/a-71042704) a surprise military exercise around Taiwan, which involved around 90 warships and coast guard vessels and included simulating attacks on foreign ships and practicing the blockading of sea routes. In April 2025, RedNovember also conducted reconnaissance against infrastructure associated with two national scientific research organizations in Taiwan, including one focusing on research and development work related to semiconductors. ##### South Korea Insikt Group first observed RedNovember targeting South Korea in late August 2024. Between late August 2024 and March 2025, RedNovember compromised a Korean nonprofit organization in the financial services sector. The organization was observed communicating with several of the threat group’s Pantegana C2 servers. Korean organizations were also targeted as part of RedNovember’s April 2025 exploitation wave against Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices, such as when Insikt Group observed the suspected compromise of a nuclear safety-related organization in South Korea funded by the Korean government, which is a top research and development entity and has been significantly involved in South Korea’s supercomputing and quantum computing efforts. RedNovember also conducted reconnaissance against ICS VPN appliances on a Korean telecommunications company, a Korean marine vessel classification organization, and a Korean national research university. #### Broad Targeting of Panamanian Government Entities Between April 22 and April 24, 2025, Insikt Group observed a significant effort by RedNovember to scan and likely reconnoiter over 30 Panamanian organizations, the majority of which are related to the Panamanian government. Targeted devices and organizations included Panamaian government bodies focused on finance, international relations, and transportation. The targeting also included several other government ministries, including ones focused on land and economic development and emergency services organizations. The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s visit to Panama in early April 2025, and may have been triggered at least in part by several remarks made by US President Donald Trump during January and February 2025 that suggested US interest in asserting control over the Panama Canal. On April 9, 2025, Secretary Hegseth [announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an “expanded partnership” with Panama to counter Chinese influence in the canal. Additionally, in February 2025, following a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Panama President José Raúl Mulino [announced](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/02/04/panama-drops-belt-and-road-agreement-with-china-after-us-pressure_6737775_4.html) that the country would formally leave China’s flagship foreign development project Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), by not renewing the current Memorandum of Understanding, and that Panama would also [review](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/panama-said-to-mull-canceling-port-deal-with-hong-kong-firm) its contracts with Hong Kong firm Hutchison PPC, which currently manages Panama’s ports of Balboa and Cristóbal. An agreement on the sale involving the two ports to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock and MSC (Mediterranean Shipping Company), set to be signed during the first week of April 2025, had [reportedly](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-panama-canal-take-back-military-china-blackrock-rcna199438) been delayed under pressure from China. **_Figure 3:_** _Breakdown of RedNovember reconnaissance and compromise activity by country between June 2024 and May 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)_ #### Targeting of US and European Defense and Aerospace Organizations In July 2024, Insikt Group observed RedNovember conduct a broad reconnaissance campaign exclusively targeting prominent aerospace and defense organizations, with a particular focus on the US. This activity involved suspected port scanning from the RedNovember IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57_ against these networks. There was no evidence to suggest a successful compromise or exploitation took place against these entities. However, this activity demonstrated that RedNovember was expanding its targeting to include the US defense industrial base and other global defense organizations. In the first half of 2025, Insikt Group has observed further RedNovember reconnaissance activity and compromises targeting this sector. In April 2025, communications were observed between a RedNovember reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation server and infrastructure associated with a European space focused research center. As part of its April 2025 targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices, RedNovember targeted a specialized US engineering and military contractor. Insikt Group observed direct connections between the same RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 and exploitation server and two of the organization’s ICS VPN Internet-facing endpoints over a period of two days; however, there is currently no sufficient evidence to conclude that RedNovember succeeded in compromising the target. Also in April 2025, RedNovember conducted extensive reconnaissance against an IP address space associated with a higher education institution associated with the US Navy. Insikt Group did not observe evidence of the organization being compromised. #### Targeting of the Private Sector ##### European Manufacturing Companies In March 2025, Insikt Group identified direct reconnaissance and communications with RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2s that indicated RedNovember’s possible compromise of a European engine manufacturer. The threat group targeted a SonicWall VPN device and login pages for the company’s F5 BIG-IP devices and VDI environment. RedNovember also browsed to a server that hosts a SonicWall SonicOS and a SonicWall SSL VPN instance for a UK-based defense contractor. Additionally, also in March 2025, Insikt Group observed RedNovember-controlled IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]24_ browsing to a SonicWall SonicOS and SonicWall SSL-VPN instance of a United Kingdom (UK)-based company focusing on bespoke cable harnessing, including for aerospace, military and defense, and medical applications. ##### Law Firms (Globally) The group compromised a SonicWall SonicOS and SSL VPN device belonging to an American law firm in April 2025. RedNovember also targeted IP addresses, including a Palo Alto GlobalProtect Gateway Httpd sever, associated with a global law firm that has been involved in a debt restructuring project with a Chinese company. ##### Taiwanese Technology Companies Between at least July 2024 and March 2025, RedNovember compromised a Taiwanese IT company using the Pantegana C2 IP addresses _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]57\\[.\\]116_ and _205\\[.\\]185\\[.\\]126\\[.\\]208_. RedNovember has shown particular interest in Taiwanese companies, particularly ones related to semiconductors and technology, as well as Taiwanese government bodies related to science. ##### US Oil and Gas Companies In April 2025, RedNovember conducted reconnaissance of two American oil and gas companies. Insikt Group had previously publicly [reported](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign) on RedNovember targeting American utilities organizations in 2024, in the context of a campaign targeting Palo Alto GlobalProtect devices. #### Broad Targeting of Fijian Government, Financial, Transportation, and Media Entities In July 2024, Insikt Group identified a surge in RedNovember activity targeting over 50 Fijian organizations via the actor-controlled IP addresses _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57_ and _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]47\\[.\\]6_. This activity exclusively targeted OWA and Sophos UTM login portals of these organizations. Notable targets included multiple Fijian financial institutions, transportation authorities, media, and government organizations. In particular, the identified targeting of multiple land, sea, and air transportation authorities aligns with ongoing Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) interests within Fiji ( [1](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3243118/fiji-woos-china-upgrade-strategically-important-ports-even-debt-concerns-mount), [2](https://fijionenews.com.fj/fiji-enters-into-300m-china-bri-deal/)), exemplifying RedNovember activity correlating with Chinese state interests. #### Surge Targeting of Edge Devices and Vulnerability Exploitation RedNovember has repeatedly conducted surge targeting of specific edge devices following the disclosure of vulnerabilities and the publication of PoC exploit code for those same devices. Insikt Group has also observed evidence that the group has targeted the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) and a Microsoft Exchange server. RedNovember has a history of targeting vulnerabilities in edge devices. In April 2024, following the release of a PoC exploit for the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability CVE-2024-3400, the group likely [conducted](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign) reconnaissance and exploitation activity against Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect appliances associated with American education, finance, legal, local government, and utilities organizations. ##### Targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure VPN in April 2025 In April 2025, RedNovember conducted a campaign focused on the reconnaissance and targeting of Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) VPN devices across multiple countries. Specific targets included a major American newspaper, a specialized US engineering and military contractor, and two prominent Korean institutes associated with scientific research and nuclear regulation. ##### Likely Targeting of Check Point VPN Gateways Following CVE-2024-24919 PoC Publication From June 3 to June 6, 2024, Insikt Group observed outbound communications from RedNovember IP address _209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]47\\[.\\]6_ to Check Point VPN gateways linked to at least 60 organizations, mainly in Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the US (see **Figure 4**). This activity appeared relatively opportunistic, with minimal themes identified across targeted organizations. Notably, on May 30, 2024, a PoC exploit was [published](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/) for the arbitrary file read vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 affecting multiple Check Point VPN gateway products, which led to widespread [exploitation](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/whats-going-on-with-checkpoint-cve-2024-24919) in the wild by multiple threat actors. While unconfirmed, the timing of the RedNovember activity suggests that the group may have attempted to exploit this vulnerability following the publication of this PoC. Similar behavior by RedNovember was previously noted concerning the targeting of Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, which closely aligned with the release of a public PoC for the arbitrary file creation vulnerability CVE-2024-3400. **_Figure 4:_** _Breakdown of RedNovember Check Point VPN targeting by country in early June 2024_ _(Source: Recorded Future)_ ### Tools Used by RedNovember #### LESLIELOADER and SparkRAT Insikt Group identified two LESLIELOADER samples used by RedNovember to load SparkRAT. The group has previously used a variant of the [publicly available](https://github.com/HZzz2/go-shellcode-loader) Go-based loader LESLIELOADER to load SparkRAT, including in a chain documented by Kroll [research](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/leslieloader-undocumented-loader-observed?) in March 2024. **SHA256 Hash** **SparkRAT C2 IP Address** `8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d` 209\\[.\\]141\\[.\\]46\\[.\\]57 `06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2` 107\\[.\\]189\\[.\\]8\\[.\\]240 **_Table 1:_** _RedNovember LESLIELOADER samples used to load SparkRAT (Source: Recorded Future)_ The 06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2 sample was first uploaded to a public malware repository within a ZIP file (SHA256: 675874ac8fbe66e76244759ae398a4d30da84ef2435a1384c4be549ca9eba18b), which also contained a PDF lure document (SHA256: 1e37efcd3cd647e6ce5414ae8e353ca690c2d3f7a701a1cc2ec29a4813f5c90b). The PDF lure, which was highly likely delivered via email-based spearphishing, purported to come from the IT department of a US Navy contractor company, and directed targets receiving the file to download and install the LESLIELOADER sample from the threat actor-controlled malicious domain _download\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg_. The LESLIELOADER executable masqueraded as a security patch for VMware software, and its filename included the specific name of the US contractor company being targeted. #### LESLIELOADER and Cobalt Strike In May 2025, Insikt Group identified two additional samples of LESLIELOADER used to load Cobalt Strike Beacon in memory. **SHA256 Hash** **Cobalt Strike C2 IP Address** `134ed0407956ff1ac59f38e89742e357cc3be565cbaff18b424ed1bcfd130978` 47\\[.\\]103\\[.\\]218\\[.\\]35 `2bee2cc42322e928bfa0650c5416b14bc0200f2d1156304179d63982baa835dc` **_Table 2:_** _RedNovember LESLIELOADER samples used to load Cobalt Strike (Source: Recorded Future)_ Notably, in this case, the server was hosted in China, specifically on ALIBABA-CN-NET (AS37963), and the Cobalt Strike service was run on TCP port 80. #### Additional Malicious Documents Insikt Group also identified a malicious Word document directing victims to the RedNovember-controlled domain _login\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg_ (SHA256: 9a1077f57bac5610d44ac46a8958dd5469522a3db466f164f4dfeada73847b79), specifically to the URL: _hxxps://login\\[.\\]offiec\\[.\\]us\\[.\\]kg/ms-help.html._ The subdomain name “offiec” could be a typosquat reference to the Microsoft Office suite. The file was last modified on August 14, 2024, and was first submitted to a public malware scanner on August 15, 2024. The `ms-help.html` file (SHA256: dba860617762bc713771de351026eb683546b37489fa0359064948f263438030) downloaded by the Word document appears to have been an exploit for the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-3019). #### Other Potential Tools Insikt Group has observed RedNovember using multiple file-sharing websites and tools to scan for vulnerabilities. **pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk** In October 2024, Insikt Group observed connections between a RedNovember server and the website _pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk_, an anonymous file-sharing website. This website has been previously [highlighted](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-post-exploitation-lateral-movement) by Mandiant as being used by a suspected China-based threat actor, UNC5266, as part of an exploitation campaign targeting Ivanti devices in 2024. UNC5266 allegedly used the file-sharing website to stage malware payloads and attempted to retrieve them through `curl` and `wget` requests to specific URL paths on the website. Insikt Group does not currently have evidence to substantiate any links between UNC5266 and RedNovember. Since at least January 23, 2025, and as of July 22, 2025, the domain’s landing page displays a Chinese-language message which in translation reads as: “Statement on the abuse of ‘pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk’ by cyber attackers.” The statement acknowledges that recent public reporting has highlighted suspect misuse of the platform by cyber threat actors, stating that it has no connection to such incidents and that it abides by applicable laws and regulations. According to the statement, the platform is temporarily unavailable while work is being conducted to “optimize the download logic and add authentication verification.” **_Figure 5:_** _Statement on the pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk main page (Source: urlscan.io)_ **PortSwigger** RedNovember connected on multiple occasions to the PortSwigger website. PortSwigger provides tools for web application security testing and scanning. Its main product, Burp Suite, is widely used by security researchers — and, occasionally, by threat actors — to test and scan web applications for vulnerabilities. **Filemail** RedNovember connected to a dedicated Filemail instance with a domain of _3008\\[.\\]filemail\\[.\\]com_. Filemail is a cloud-based file transfer service solution that allows users to upload, send, and share large files via email or shareable links. **Acunetix** In at least one instance, a RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 server ran the vulnerability scanner tool Acunetix, suggesting that the threat group may also be using this tool as part of its reconnaissance activity. **Hacker Target** RedNovember used one of its servers to access the _hackertarget\\[.\\]com_ website in April 2025. Hacker Target provides a free online vulnerability scanner platform with multiple features, including Nmap and ZMap scans, and domain and server profiling. **Wayback Machine** In April 2025, RedNovember used at least two of its servers to navigate to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Insikt Group did not have visibility into what the threat group queried in the archive. **Crt\\[.\\]sh** Also in April 2025, RedNovember accessed _crt\\[.\\]sh_, a free online TLS certificate transparency service that allows users to look up TLS certificate logs by domain or certificate hash. **Gofile\\[.\\]io** Additionally, in April 2025, RedNovember connected to the free cloud storage service _gofile\\[.\\]io_, suggesting that the threat actor might have uploaded or browsed files from an account it held on the platform. As highlighted above, RedNovember has previously used similar services, such as the aforementioned _pan\\[.\\]xj\\[.\\]hk_. ## Mitigations Organizations should take the following measures to detect and mitigate observed TTPs associated with RedNovember activity: - Detect and block malicious infrastructure such as Pantegana, SparkRAT, and Cobalt Strike C2 servers in real time via the [Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence) module. - [Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence) module users can monitor real-time output to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity involving key vendors and partners within physical, network, and software supply chains. - By monitoring Infrastructure Analysis events, Recorded Future customers can alert on and monitor RedNovember C2 IP addresses. - By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future customers can alert on and proactively monitor infrastructure involved in notable communication to known RedNovember C2 IP addresses. - Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those exploited in the wild as determined through the [Recorded Future® Vulnerability Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence) module. The public availability of exploit code can substantially increase the likelihood of mass exploitation ( [1](https://www.securityweek.com/poc-published-fortinet-vulnerability-mass-exploitation-attempts-begin/), [2](https://www.securityweek.com/exploitation-of-palo-alto-firewall-vulnerability-picking-up-after-poc-release/), [3](https://www.securityweek.com/mass-exploitation-of-citrix-bleed-vulnerability-underway/)). To specifically protect against some Chinese state-sponsored groups, pay particular attention to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in external-facing appliances within your environment. - Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking connection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains linked in **Appendix A**. - Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities are in place for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor for follow-on activity likely to occur following exploitation of these external-facing services, such as the deployment of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells, as well as subsequent lateral movement to internal networks. - Regularly audit internet-facing and perimeter appliances, and reduce attack surfaces by disabling both internet-facing and internal interfaces or portals where no longer required, and by reducing appliances exposed to the internet to only those that are strictly required. - Consider logging capabilities and security product support when initially procuring network appliances, in order to be appropriately positioned to detect and respond to threats. - Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information; consider implementing multi-factor authentication and extremely restricted access and storage on systems only accessible via an internal network. - Focus on defense-in-depth strategies, such as detecting post-exploitation persistence, discovery, and lateral movement activities, as well as unusual network communications. Such strategies can aid detection and response to intrusions arising from the exploitation of both known and zero-day vulnerabilities. ## Outlook RedNovember has historically targeted a diverse range of countries and sectors, suggesting broad and changing intelligence requirements. Some of its activity appears to align with a military affiliation or military-adjacent interests, such as the targeting of specific entities in the US DIB, or the targeting of Taiwan around the time of China’s military exercises in Taiwan. However, there are different sets of targeting that do not closely match this pattern: for example, the targeting of law firms, newspaper organizations, and a Christian denomination in the US. Other clusters of RedNovember activity signal a clear interest in foreign governments and foreign policy, such as the targeting of international multilateral organizations based in Southeast Asia and government ministries in several Southeast Asian countries and South American countries, as well as the reconnaissance against dozens of Panamanian government departments in April 2025. Based on its visibility and collection, Insikt Group has observed that RedNovember’s activity to date has primarily focused on several key geographies, including the US, Southeast Asia, the Pacific region, and South America. While targets and victims have also been identified in Europe and at least one in Africa, the overall volume of activity directed toward these areas has been notably lower than that observed in the primary regions of focus. From a sector perspective, RedNovember continued targeting government organizations in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and South America, intergovernmental organizations in Southeast Asia, and religious organizations. However, since our first public report on the group, we have also observed RedNovember expand its targeting to defense and aerospace organizations, the private sector, and at least two news outlets. Insikt Group anticipates that RedNovember, along with other Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups, will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release. ## Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise ``` Domains: aeifile[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg citrix[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg cna[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg download[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg gp[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg login[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg test[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg vpn[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg vpn1[.]offiec[.]us[.]kg RedNovember Pantegana C2 IP Addresses: 45[.]61[.]187[.]124 198[.]98[.]50[.]218 198[.]98[.]53[.]163 198[.]98[.]61[.]155 209[.]141[.]37[.]254 205[.]185[.]126[.]208 205[.]185[.]124[.]24 209[.]141[.]42[.]131 209[.]141[.]46[.]83 209[.]141[.]57[.]116 RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 IP Address: 47[.]103[.]218[.]35 RedNovember Cobalt Strike C2 URLs: hxxp://47[.]103[.]218[.]35/pixel hxxp://47[.]103[.]218[.]35/GSjY LESLIELOADER SHA256 hashes: 06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2 134ed0407956ff1ac59f38e89742e357cc3be565cbaff18b424ed1bcfd130978 2bee2cc42322e928bfa0650c5416b14bc0200f2d1156304179d63982baa835dc 8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d ZIP file SHA256 hash: 675874ac8fbe66e76244759ae398a4d30da84ef2435a1384c4be549ca9eba18b PDF lure SHA256 hash: 1e37efcd3cd647e6ce5414ae8e353ca690c2d3f7a701a1cc2ec29a4813f5c90b Malicious Follina Word document SHA256 hashes: 9a1077f57bac5610d44ac46a8958dd5469522a3db466f164f4dfeada73847b79 dba860617762bc713771de351026eb683546b37489fa0359064948f263438030 ``` ## Appendix B: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques **Tactic: Technique** **ATT&CK Code** **Resource Development:** Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server [T1583.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003/) **Reconnaissance:** Gather Victim Network Information: Network Security Appliances [T1590.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/006/) **Initial Access:** Exploit Public-Facing Application [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/) **Execution:** User Execution: Malicious Link [T1204.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001/) **Execution:** User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/) **Command and Control:** Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols [T1071.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/) **Command and Control:** Non-Standard Port [T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571/) ## Appendix C: LESLIELOADER YARA Rule ``` rule MAL_LESLIELOADER { meta: author = \"Insikt Group, Recorded Future\" date = \"2024-11-14\" description = \"Detects LESLIELOADER Malware used by RedNovember\" version = \"1.0\" hash = \"8679a25c78e104c6e74996b75882e378f420614fe1379ee9c1e266a11ffa096d\" hash = \"06e87a03507213322d876b459194021f876ba90f85c5faa401820954045cd1d2\" malware = \"LESLIELOADER\" malware_id = \"u-6JwI\" category = \"MALWARE\" strings: $s1 = \".DecrptogAES\" $s2 = \".UnPaddingText1\" // AES key 1 $k1a = \"LeslieCh\" $k1b = \"eungKwok\" // AES key 2 $k2a = { 33 44 37 35 45 34 43 39 } $k2b = { 42 33 32 41 42 45 31 37 } condition: uint16be(0) == 0x4d5a and all of ($s*) and 2 of ($k*) } ``` ## Appendix D: RedNovember Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis",

It continues to be so.”_– Prime Minister Manmohan Singh There is a threat to India’s existence. It has little to do with radical Islam or potential conflict with Pakistan.The once-suppressed Naxalite insurgency is siphoning the flows of globalization and inhibiting the economic expansion of almost half the country. In just five years, Naxals have killed hundreds of security personnel, and more than doubled their reach from 75 to 200 districts.\\[i\\] _From Ideology To Warfare_ The insurgency takes its name from the village of Naxalbari in West Bengal. There, in March 1967, a generation of college-educated Maoist ideologues was given purpose when it united to free the peasant class from the bonds of land-owner servitude. In short order, these ragtag forces, armed with crude bows, arrows, and farming implements had claimed some 300 square miles of territory – 2,000 villages and 15,000 residents. Within this ‘liberated zone’ the cadre set up a governing body that canceled debt, destroyed ownership records, and fixed commodity prices. Delivering on ideology took precedence over security, and soon a combination of poor tactical skills, lack of modern weaponry, and overwhelming police force put an end to this insurrection. 5,000 attempts to reignite the flames of revolution over the next three years failed, and by 1972, some 40,000 members and leaders of the insurgency languished in jail. ii For the next decade, the Naxals lay mostly dormant. A handful of highly fragmented groups focused on energizing their rural population base. Some conducting sporadic guerrilla operations. However, when violence gained intensity, it faced ruthless opposition, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, and failed to achieve lasting impact. It was not until India’s economy was pried open in 1991 that the Naxals again emerged on the national stage. _Resurgence_ Over the past twenty years, India has signed thousands of contracts that parcel out its reserves of bauxite, thorium, and coal, respectively 10 percent, 12 percent, and 7 percent of the world’s reserves. Should the Naxals allow it, India could earn upwards of $80 billion for its significant mineral resources.iii Unfortunately 80 percent these natural resources are found in four states that lack both governance and opportunity. Despite aggregate foreign direct investment of $145 billion in this area since 1991, the Reserve Bank of India estimates those states receive less than five percent of this cash flow.iv Consequently, these states constitute only 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.The average per capita income level for all, combined, is less than the $900 per year. A recent study found that, compared to non-Naxal affected states, these resource-rich but prosperity-poor states lost on average 12 percent of economic productivity year on year.v Sensing opportunity in this disconnect, the modern Naxal has pioneered a strategy that enables the organization to control these the flows of resources, and wield them against the state. ### A New Strategy _“We are ready with a blueprint to prevent entry into the region.”_-Rakeshji, Naxal Spokesman, Orissa. Instead of relying on ideology to amass huge numbers with shared purpose, this generation emphasizes execution: building tactical training, capturing popular support, and stockpiling equipment. The goal remains the same – rendering the Indian state incapable of governing – but the means are notably different. _Overruns_ On April 6, 2010, a convoy of 120 federal and state police forces returning from conducting operations deep in the forests of Dantewada was ambushed. Two land mines detonated, then 300 Naxals swarmed the fatigued and disoriented troops. Reinforcements rushed to the scene, only to discover 75 dead policemen and burning wreckage. At the time, this was the insurgency’s deadliest attack. Naxals regularly overrun targets – that is, concentrate overwhelming numbers and firepower on a single location. In contrast to a strategy designed to maintain control of an area, as in Naxalbari, this guerrilla approach prevents state troops from engaging the group and minimizes the exposure of the insurgency to harm. In particular, Naxals target police forces and more specialized paramilitary units patrolling the forests. After executing a successful ambush, the insurgents pillage what equipment was not destroyed and disappear into the night. Any loot is sorted in a secure location. In a two-year period beginning in 2008, the Naxals conducted 6,000 such attacks. In addition to ambushes, the insurgency: • **Used improvised explosive devices.** Every year, dozens of police units are hit with Naxal-placed landmines. Police have found that metal detectors aid in preventing land mines placed just under the surface from exploding. In response, the Naxals have adapted their approach. Now the insurgency actually embeds explosives in roads while still under construction. The Naxal can simply connect a detonator to explosives already in place and lay in wait for unsuspecting police.vi • **Assassinated officials.** In an effort to silence former Chief Minister of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi, the insurgency stormed a sporting event attended by his brother. In the hail of gunfire, they killed his son instead. Only months before, the Naxals had publicly shot a Member of Parliament, Sunit Mahato, seven times and set his jeep ablaze.vii • **Destroyed police infrastructure.** Naxals regularly overrun remote forest ranger outposts as well as more urban police stations. The insurgency specializes in night raids that begin with grenades followed by indiscriminate automatic weapons fire. In 2005, Naxals overwhelmed a jail in Bihar, setting free almost 400 of their own. These prison breaks can even come from inside. A Naxal-led riot inside a Chhattisgarh prison overcame 16 jailers. 253 prisoners escaped, 50 of them members of the insurgency.viii Recognizing the disruptive value of thousands of overruns in rapid succession, Naxals have shifted their strategy to exploit this vulnerability. jjjjjjjjjjjjj _Systems Disruption_ At 64 billion tons, the state-owned Coal India is the largest single holder of coal reserves in the world. The company produces over 430 million tons of coal per year. An initial public offering of its stock in 2010 that earned $53 billion. A deeper look at its portfolio reveals some troubling facts, however. 92% of the company’s coal production is from 11 fields that sit squarely in Naxal territory.ix And they are under fire. In 2007, the state of Jharkhand saw 60,000 tons disrupted. In 2011, that number hit 110,000. x Naxals attack not just nodes, but networks, such as railways and roads used to transport coal. There were 900 such attacks over the last four years, and the pace is quickening. These attacks include: hijackings, in which hundreds of paying passengers are removed and replaced with sympathizers; bombing freight trains; destroying tracks in order to derail trains; and holding passengers hostage.xi These tactics require remarkably few resources to execute, yet generate out-sized returns. In the hours before the ‘Jnaneswari Express’, a fast passenger train, was to pass by, Naxal-affiliated organizations pulled the pins tethering 50 feet of the railroad tracks to the ground using only a shovel and a pick. When the Jnaneswari approached, the tracks shook loose, destabilized the engine, and the train derailed. A freight train headed in the opposite direction was unable to stop and slammed into the 13 carriages littered across the tracks going in both directions. 141 were dead, 180 were injured. Further, the insurgency can cause major delays to cascade through the system, such as in 2010 when Naxals destroyed three feet of track, bringing 24 trains to a halt.xii As a result, all night trains through insurgency-affected areas have been banned. Companies have resorted to transporting goods by road – incurring costly delays in the process. In 2009 alone, the Indian Railways lost $110 million – a 40% loss from the previous year.xiii There are long-term consequences as well. In Jharkhand, a $259 million increase in costs caused by frequent Naxal attacks has ended six major railway development projects.xiv The National Mineral Development Corporation, distressed by the threat to railways, began construction on a pipeline system. Unfortunately, this network is more vulnerable to the same kind of attack, and in June 2009, Naxals targeted it, causing a loss of $200 million.xv Now, the NMDC is building a $200 million pipeline system along existing roads to ensure regular police patrols.xvi However, in addition to the police, the road infrastructure itself is easily disrupted as well. Naxals frequently attack contractors building roads and set vehicles and machinery on fire to delay construction.xvii Given that the NMDC relies on a single district in Naxal territory for 71 percent of its output, it now operates at the mercy of the insurgency.xviii Telecommunications infrastructure is under attack as well. As India prospered, a network of cell towers spread across the country. Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, two of the states hardest-hit by Naxals have 1400 such towers. The government is intent upon building an additional 550.xix But this will be a turbulent process, should it happen at all. Disrupting telecommunications infrastructure enables the Naxals to isolate rural areas from the flow of information. In particular, informers and police forces are prevented from passing on intelligence or calling for reinforcements.In 2009, the state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited planned to build 14 towers in south Orissa. After Naxals attacked three, causing $700,000 in damage, the company temporarily abandoned its plans to expand in the area. Since 2006, Naxals have destroyed more than 70 cell phone towers in six states. To mitigate this threat, not unlike the NMDC’s plan for its pipelines, the communications providers have taken to placing cell phone towers around existing infrastructure, the reasoning being that police can better ensure the safety of the tower, if it resides within the walls of the network of police camps that litter the forests. Raids conducted by the Naxals have shown that this is no deterrent, and could instead present an incentive to attack two valuable targets at once. This begs the question: if the Naxals possess overwhelming force, leverage the element of surprise, and the ability to successfully execute hundreds of these attacks per year, why aren’t they concentrating on the highest-yielding attacks on critical infrastructure? Why not engineer a total shutdown? ### The Deviant Economic Engine _“The Naxals see industry as a source of earning and won’t ruin its work.”_-Vishwa Ranjan, Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh. The answer is to be found in what is the clearest demarcation between Naxalbari’s revolutionaries and the insurgency of today. This generation has embraced profit. India’s illicit economy is estimated to consist of between 40 and 88 percent of the size of the legitimate economy – somewhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion. The Naxals underpin a huge segment of this growing market. Their strategy of weaponizing markets has sparked a deviant economic engine that steadily burns through the poorest parts of India. _The Revolutionary Tax_ In 2000, India set about an ambitious project to connect at-risk villages with populations to major road arteries by 2003. It is a powerful initiative, and has thus far built 175,000 miles of road, though 1.6 million miles of rural road system remain barely passable. This project was reinforced in late 2010 by a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank.xx It was not only the government or the people that cheered this initiative on. This investment represents a huge windfall for the Naxals as well, for as former Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval estimates, between 30 and 40 percent of development funds have been captured by the Naxals.xxi Having proven their ability to destroy critical nodes and crash networks, Naxals are now able to exact ransoms for the mere threat of violence. This enables the insurgency to extort directly hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses, including: small shops; paper, and rice mills; doctors; and property owners. The insurgency calls this a “revolutionary tax.” One captured leader revealed going extortion rates (per month): $2 for daycares; $4 for elementary school teachers; $10 for high school teachers; $4 for bank employees; $14 for bank managers; $100 for businessmen; $.20 and a kilogram of rice for villagers.xxii This strategy yields massive return. In Chhattisgarh alone, Naxals extorted $60 million from mining firms, the transportation sector, and government contractors in 2009.xxiii That state’s Director General of Police, Vishwa Ranjan, estimated the national revenue of the Naxals at $400 million per year.xxiv Perhaps due to the outcry around these large figures, the following year’s estimates were remarkably lower, at $30 million and $280 million, respectively.xxv Since how much the Naxals are able to extort is tethered to how much the government spends, there is no sign that this source of revenue will diminish. Indeed, the government has allocated $3 billion over the next decade for construction designed to dampen the Naxal threat, including affordable housing, roads, highways, hostels, hospitals, drinking water projects, and electricity networks.xxvi Much of that will fall into the hands of those it is designed to attack. _A Revolutionary Tax Economy_ To maximize returns, the insurgency has begun to operate with what looks surprisingly like a franchise model. Using force and propaganda, the Naxals create an environment that incentivizes and enable others to participate in an extortion ecosystem. In this role as a black market maker, the insurgency accomplishes two tasks: eroding the ability of the state to govern, and building a sizable war chest. For example, in Chhattisgarh, the insurgency discovered gangs were shaking down businesses and government officials by imitating the extortion letters written by real Naxals. Naxals responded to this dilution of their brand with violence against the gangs. They then enforced a simple edict: gangs could extort as long as they did not cut into existing Naxal revenue. Chhattisgarh’s criminals now operate within Naxal bounds, give a portion of their revenue, estimated at more than $4 million, to the insurgency, and seek out new victims, in both the legitimate and illicit economies. The model works so well that it has been emulated by a variety of illicit enterprises across the country: • **Mining.** Government records show 182,000 instances of illegal mining across 17 states, with 30 percent of those being found in the Naxal-affected area. There are an estimated 60,000 illegal mines operating today, with 500 million untrained laborers who work in entirely unregulated conditions.xxvii These mines are operated by criminal organizations that also pay into the Naxal revenue pool. Prasoon S. Majumdar, Editor of Economic Affairs, estimates that Naxals receive between 20 and 30 percent of the revenue for each truckload of coal, with 15 percent reserved for corrupt local bureaucrats and policemen.xxviii To continue unhindered, illegal miners bribe individual police inspectors at the cost of $7,000 per year. • **Narcotics.** India is the world’s largest legitimate producer of opium for the global pharmaceutical industry. Every year, it issues thousands of permits to farmers to match licit demand. Motivated by the potential for massive returns, some farmers operate outside this system, risking the wrath of security forces for a crop worth $80 per pound. The U.S. State Department estimates that as much as 30% of India’s opium production is diverted to the black market. xxix Two districts in Jharkhand alone generate $200 million per growing season. Naxals, noting this opportunity, step in and provide protection in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Though government forces destroyed more than $270 million worth of illegal crops in 2007 alone, farmers are still motivated to participate in this alternate economy. • **Informal tolls.** Naxals and their affiliates are notorious for establishing roadblocks on major road arteries. While this is not a high-yield enterprise, it does amount to forcibly transforming critical state infrastructure into an illicit profit center. These blockades are not complex affairs. Often, a few individuals knock down a tree, or a band of young men lock arms and form a human chain across the road. They then demand a two- to six-dollar payment from passing vehicles under the implicit threat of violence. Whereas the state can only levy tax on legitimate enterprises, the Naxals have successfully expanded their revolutionary tax pool to include illicit actors. By creating opportunity where there was none, the Naxals have sparked a deviant economic engine. Naxals disrupt government operations and provide safe harbor for deviant entrepreneurs to continue their activities unmolested. In exchange, they receive a share of revenue. This positive feedback loop enables the black market to prosper, the Naxals to build their capacity for violence, and the Indian state to decline. ### A Strategic Half-Life _“It’s a fact that they have been robbed of their livelihood. Therefore, they_ _look to the Naxals for justice.”_–Arvind Inamdar, Director-General of Police, Maharashtra. While the illicit economy provides revenue, generates trained and hardened troops, and seeds rot in the heart of the state, the expansion of opportunity into their territory presents an existential threat to the Naxals. For now, however, the benefits of co-opted globalization sustain and enable the insurgency to surpass the wildest expectations of those who fought in Naxalbari. What money remains after covering operational expenses is used to expand and to arm. In 2007, the Naxals bought uniforms, AK-47s, vehicles, and medicine worth $35 million, a far cry from the days of crude weapons. A time draws near when Naxals will not be content with melting into the forest, partial systems disruption will not cause enough damage, and the revolutionary tax across all sectors of the formal and informal economies will be outweighed by the impact of foreign investment on the lives of India’s most removed citizens. India’s strategy of development-as-counterinsurgency is fundamentally sound. If capital finds its way to the edges of India, if the government overcomes corruption, disruption, and overruns, rural citizens will advance. They will become better educated, find new work, or perhaps migrate to the cities. This is an unacceptable outcome to the insurgency, which is predicated on the suffering of this peasant base. And so the Naxals prepare. In the densest of jungles, they silently shape the way the world invests in India, facilitate widespread corruption, and arm themselves for what they see as the fight for the future. _Sources:_ i Mahendra Kumawat, “Naxal Movement Has Shown Tremendous Grit,” Rediff News, April 9, 2010. ii Waquar Ahmed, Amitabh Kundu, and Richard Peet, India’s New Economic Policy: A Critical Analysis (New York: Routledge, 2011). iii Bibhudatta Pradhan and Santosh Kumar, “Pillai to End Maoist Grip on $80 Billion Investments,” Bloomberg Businessweek, September 17, 2010. iv Government of India, “Fact Sheet On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI),” Ministry of Commerce and Industry, February 11, 2011, http://dipp.nic.in/fdi\\_statistics/india\\_FDI\\_February2011.pdf (accessed March 23, 2011). v Rahul Nilakantan and Saurabh Singhal, “The Economic Costs Of Naxalite Violence and the Economic Benefits of a Unique Robust Security Response,” 2010. http://www.aae.wisc.edu/mwiedc/papers/2011/Singhal\\_Saurabh.pdf (accessed April 3, 2011). vi “Chhattisgarh’s Entire Forest Area A Minefield?,” Times of India, May 10, 2010. vii Manoj Prasad, “Former Jharkhand CM Marandi on Their Hitlist, Naxals Kill Son, 17 More,” Indian Express, October 28, 2007. viii Press Trust of India, “Maoists Storm Jehanabad Jail,” Rediff News, November 14, 2005. ix Sudheer Pal Singh, “Illegal Mining May Impede Divestment in Coal India,” Business Standard, August 21, 2010. x Government of India, “Loss of Coal Production in Naxalite Areas,” Press Information Bureau, August 4, 2010, http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=64116 (accessed January 4, 2011). xi “Chronology of Naxal Attacks on Trains,” India Today, May 28, 2010. xii Law Kumar Mishra, “Maoists Blow Up Track on Gaya-Dhanbad Section, Rail Traffic Disrupted,” Times of India, September 13, 2010. xiii “Naxal Attacks Doubled in 2009, Rlys Lost Rs 500cr: Mamata,” Times of India, April 23, 2010. xiv Manoj Prasad, “Naxal Attacks, Escalated Cost Derail Jharkhand Railway Projects,” India Express, April 12, 2010. xv Ishita Ayan Dutt, “Naxal Hits to Pull NMDC Net Down by Rs 1,000 cr,” Business Standard, April 20, 2010. xvi “NMDC to Lay 12 mt Pipeline on Highways to Avoid Naxal Attacks,” The Financial Express, July 20, 2010. xvii “Naxals Obstruct Road Works,” The Hindu, May 9, 2011. xviii Dutt. xix Sandeep Joshi, “550 More Mobile Towers to Boost Fight Against Naxalites,” The Hindu, June 30, 2010. xx “World Bank Approves $1.5 billion for India’s Rural Roads Scheme,” Press Trust of India, December 22, 2010. xxi Prassana Mohanty, “Maoists’ Financing – The Blood Flows as Long as the Cash Flows,” Governance Now, April 7, 2010. xxii Mohanty xxiii Sujeet Kumar, “Maoists extort Rs 300 Crore Annually in Chhattisgarh,” The Economic Times, July 5, 2009. xxiv Bharti Jain, “Rs 150 Crore: Maoists Extortion Amount From Chhattisgarh SSIs,” The EconomicTimes, April 10, 2010. xxv Ajit Kumar Singh and Sachin Bansidhar Diwan, “Red Money,” Outlook India, April 5, 2010. xxvi Ministry of Home Affairs, 2010-2011 Annual Report (Delhi: Government of India, 2011). xxvii Shaikh Azizur Rahman, “India’s Illegal Coal Mines Turn Into Death Pits,” The WashingtonTimes, November 24, 2006. xxviii Prasoon Majumdar, “Our Own Banana Republics!” Indian Institute of Planning andManagement, August 26, 2010, http://prasoonmajumdar.blogspot.com/2010/08/our-own-banana- republics.html (accessed April 29, 2011). xxix United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “India is a Major Drug Hub: US,” September, 2007, http://www.unodc.org/india/en/rajiv\\_quoted\\_et.html (accessed February 25, 2011).

    "title": "Briefing on the 2025 Cybersecurity Landscape: Key Threats, Trends, and Incidents",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "## Executive Summary The year 2025 is defined by a cybersecurity landscape of unprecedented velocity, complexity, and convergence. The volume and sophistication of cyber threats have escalated dramatically, with Q1 2025 data revealing a 47% year-over-year increase in weekly cyber attacks per organization and a 126% surge in ransomware incidents. This intensification is driven by a confluence of factors: the weaponization of Artificial Intelligence, persistent vulnerabilities across digital supply chains and the Internet of Things (IoT), and escalating geopolitical tensions fueling aggressive state-sponsored operations. The threat actor ecosystem is in a state of dynamic flux. Following major law enforcement disruptions, the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) market has fragmented, with new groups like **RansomHub**, **Play**, and **Akira** ascending to prominence. Concurrently, the lines between nation-state espionage and financially motivated cybercrime are blurring, exemplified by the emergence of hybrid threats like the **Warlock ransomware**, operated by the China-based actor **Storm-2603**, which targets critical infrastructure using zero-day vulnerabilities and novel data auction tactics. Major campaigns in 2025, such as the widespread compromise of Salesforce instances by the **ShinyHunters** group and the crippling ransomware attack on **Collins Aerospace's** aviation software, underscore the critical risk posed by supply chain vulnerabilities. In response, the global regulatory environment is rapidly maturing. Landmark regulations, including the EU's **NIS2 Directive** and **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)**, are coming into full effect, imposing stringent new requirements for cybersecurity, incident reporting, and supply chain risk management. In the U.S., the SEC's mandatory 4-day disclosure rule for material incidents, CISA's upcoming 72-hour reporting rule under **CIRCIA**, and significant proposed updates to the **HIPAA Security Rule** are forcing organizations to prioritize transparency and accountability. This confluence of escalating threats and stricter compliance mandates creates a clear strategic imperative for all organizations: a fundamental shift from reactive, perimeter-based security to proactive, integrated, and resilient defense strategies. The adoption of Zero Trust architecture, the development of robust AI governance, enhanced supply chain diligence, and a steadfast commitment to foundational cybersecurity hygiene are no longer best practices but essential conditions for survival and success in the 2025 threat environment. ## The Evolving Threat Landscape in 2025 ### 1.1. Escalation of Attack Volume and Severity Data from the first quarter of 2025 established a concerning baseline, indicating a high-velocity global threat landscape. - **Global Attack Volume:** The average number of weekly cyber attacks per organization surged by 47% compared to Q1 2024, reaching 1,925 attacks. - **Regional Disparities:** The growth was not uniform, with Latin America experiencing a 108% year-over-year increase, followed by Europe (+57%), North America (+40%), Africa (+39%), and the Asia-Pacific region (+38%). - **Targeted Sectors:** The most heavily targeted industries for all attack types were Education (4,484 weekly attacks), Government (2,678 weekly attacks), and Telecommunications (2,664 weekly attacks). The total economic cost of damages related to cyber warfare alone is estimated to reach **$13.1 billion** in 2025, a 21% increase from the previous year. ### 1.2. The Ransomware Ecosystem: Fragmentation and Adaptation Ransomware remains a primary driver of cyber losses, with Q1 2025 being a record-breaking period for attack volume. - **Unprecedented Growth:** Reported ransomware incidents increased by 126% compared to Q1 2024. - **Market Fragmentation:** Following law enforcement disruptions of major groups like LockBit and ALPHV/BlackCat in late 2024 and early 2025, the ecosystem has become more fragmented, with 70-80 active groups identified. This proliferation makes the threat environment more complex and less predictable. - **Dominant and Emerging Actors:** Analysis of the post-disruption landscape reveals a new cohort of leading threat actors. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Rank | Group | Key Characteristics | | 1 | **RansomHub** | Emerged as the new leader, filling the void left by LockBit. Attracted experienced affiliates with high commission splits (up to 90%). | | 2 | **Play** | Known for quiet consistency and operational execution rather than media theatrics. | | 3 | **Akira** | A veteran group that significantly ramped up its operational tempo and victim count in 2024 and 2025. | | 4 | **Qilin** | Notable for high-impact attacks on critical sectors like healthcare (e.g., Synnovis) and public services. | | 5 | **Medusa** | A long-time presence that became more aggressive in late 2024, targeting high-profile victims. | - **Evolving Tactics:** The \"double extortion\" method—encrypting data and threatening to leak stolen files—is now standard, occurring in 95% of incidents. To coerce payment, groups are employing more aggressive pressure tactics and innovating monetization strategies, such as the Warlock group's private auction of entire stolen datasets. ### 1.3. State-Sponsored Operations and Geopolitical Drivers Geopolitical instability is a significant factor in the threat landscape, directly influencing the cybersecurity strategies of nearly 60% of organizations. - **Prevalence:** State-sponsored campaigns accounted for a record **39%** of all major cyber attacks in 2025, impacting 76 countries. - **Key State Actors:** The United States, China, and Russia collectively accounted for 61% of all observed cyber warfare activity. China is identified as the most active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks. - **Primary Objectives:** Operations are focused on espionage (intellectual property theft, intelligence gathering) and the disruption of critical infrastructure. Attacks on energy, water, and transport sectors rose by 34% in 2025. - **Hybrid Threat Models:** A concerning trend is the blurring line between state-sponsored and financially motivated crime. The **Warlock ransomware** campaign, attributed to the China-based group **Storm-2603**, exemplifies this hybrid model, where nation-state capabilities are deployed for what appears to be financial gain. ### 1.4. Key Attack Vectors and Techniques Threat actors are refining their methods to maximize impact and evade detection. - **Supply Chain & Third-Party Compromise:** This vector was responsible for many of the year's most significant incidents. Attackers exploit trust relationships by targeting software vendors, managed service providers (MSPs), and cloud platforms. High-profile examples from 2025 include: - **Collins Aerospace:** A ransomware attack on its vMUSE aviation software disrupted multiple European airports. - **Salesforce Platform:** A widespread campaign by the ShinyHunters group compromised numerous Salesforce customers through social engineering, impacting companies like Air France-KLM, Cisco, and Allianz Life. - **Snowflake Platform:** A breach affecting the cloud database was linked to the massive Ticketmaster data theft. - **Other Vendors:** Breaches at third-party providers led to data exposure for companies like TransUnion, Harrods, and M&S. - **Living-off-the-Land (LotL):** A striking **79% of all threat detections were malware-free**, indicating a major shift towards using legitimate, built-in system tools (e.g., PowerShell, WMI, RDP) to conduct attacks. This technique allows adversaries to blend in with normal network activity and bypass traditional signature-based security. - **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** Actors continue to successfully exploit both publicly known and zero-day vulnerabilities. In 2025, China-linked APT groups exploited flaws in Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, and Ivanti devices, while the Warlock group rapidly weaponized a critical zero-day chain in Microsoft SharePoint dubbed \"ToolShell.\" In September, the New York Department of Financial Services issued an alert for zero-days in Cisco ASA and Firepower appliances. - **Social Engineering and Credential Theft:** Phishing and social engineering remain the most dangerous threat vector, responsible for **47.5%** of attacks. Voice phishing (vishing) campaigns have proven highly effective, leading to breaches at companies like Cisco. ## The Transformative Role of Artificial Intelligence AI is rapidly becoming a defining element of the cyber conflict, serving as both a powerful weapon and an essential defense mechanism. ### 2.1. Offensive AI: A Threat Multiplier Adversaries are leveraging AI to increase the scale, speed, and sophistication of their attacks. - **Enhanced Social Engineering:** Generative AI is used to create hyper-personalized phishing emails, smishing texts, and vishing scripts at scale. AI-powered **deepfake** technology enables highly convincing impersonations for CEO fraud, as evidenced by a case where a finance employee was tricked into transferring **$25 million** after a deepfake video conference call. - **Automated Reconnaissance and Exploitation:** AI can automate network scanning, rapidly identify vulnerabilities (including zero-days), and map attack paths far more efficiently than human operators. - **Adaptive Malware:** AI is being used to generate polymorphic malware that constantly alters its code to evade detection. AI-driven attacks represented **22%** of all state-level cyber incidents in 2025. ### 2.2. Defensive AI Integration Defenders are increasingly integrating AI to counter advanced threats. - **Advanced Threat Detection:** AI and Machine Learning are crucial for analyzing massive data volumes to detect subtle anomalies indicative of stealthy attacks like LotL intrusions or zero-day exploits. - **Automated Incident Response:** AI-powered Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms can automate critical response actions—such as isolating compromised endpoints—at machine speed, dramatically reducing response times. - **Enhanced Analytics:** AI helps security teams correlate alerts across disparate tools (EDR, network, cloud) to identify complex attack chains and reduce alert fatigue. ### 2.3. AI Governance and Security Challenges The rapid adoption of AI has outpaced the implementation of necessary security and governance, creating significant new risks. - **\"Shadow AI\":** Only 37% of organizations have a security assessment process for AI tools before deployment, leading to the use of unsecured AI systems that introduce hidden vulnerabilities. - **AI-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Organizations must now defend against new threats targeting AI systems themselves, including data poisoning, model evasion, prompt injection, and algorithmic bias. - **Fragmented Regulation:** A complex patchwork of regulations is emerging globally, led by the EU's comprehensive **AI Act**, creating significant compliance challenges. ## Major Incidents and Case Studies of 2025 Several large-scale incidents in 2025 highlight the convergence of key threats and their potential for systemic disruption. | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Incident | Date | Victim(s) | Threat Actor / Method | Key Impact and Significance | | **Collins Aerospace Attack** | Sep 2025 | Multiple European Airports (Brussels, Heathrow, Dublin, etc.) | Ransomware on vMUSE software | Widespread flight disruptions, manual check-ins. Demonstrates critical risk in specialized software supply chains. | | **Warlock Ransomware Campaign** | Summer 2025 | Colt Technology, Orange Telecom, U.S. Nuclear Agency, others | **Storm-2603** (China-linked); SharePoint \"ToolShell\" zero-day | Targeted critical infrastructure; showcased a hybrid state/criminal model and a novel data auction strategy. | | **ShinyHunters Salesforce Campaign** | Summer 2025 | Air France-KLM, Cisco, Qantas, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora | **ShinyHunters / Scattered Spider**; Social engineering / Vishing | Large-scale, successful campaign against a major SaaS platform, highlighting third-party and human-factor risks. | | **Change Healthcare Breach** | Feb 2025 | Change Healthcare (UnitedHealth Group), U.S. Healthcare System | **BlackCat (ALPHV)** Ransomware | Breach affecting an estimated **192.7 million** individuals; caused massive, weeks-long disruption to U.S. pharmacy and medical billing services. Exposed systemic risk from a single point of failure in critical infrastructure. | ## The Shifting Regulatory and Policy Landscape Governments and regulators worldwide are responding to the heightened threat environment with a wave of new, more stringent compliance mandates. ### 4.1. Global Regulatory Intensification - **European Union:** - **NIS2 Directive:** Enforcement ramps up in 2025, imposing strict cybersecurity, supply chain risk management, and 24-hour incident notification requirements on a wide range of \"essential\" and \"important\" entities, with personal liability for management. - **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA):** Becomes fully applicable in January 2025, establishing a comprehensive ICT risk management framework for the entire EU financial sector. - **United States (Federal):** - **SEC Disclosure Rule:** Now in full effect, requiring public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents within four business days. - **CIRCIA:** Final rules are expected in late 2025, which will mandate critical infrastructure operators to report significant cyber incidents to CISA within 72 hours and ransomware payments within 24 hours. - **HIPAA Security Rule Update:** A proposed update is expected to make previously \"addressable\" controls—including **MFA, encryption, and network segmentation**—mandatory for all healthcare entities. ### 4.2. U.S. Policy and Legislative Changes A new executive order issued on June 6, 2025, amended federal cybersecurity policy, primarily impacting government contractors. The order rolled back requirements for \"secure software development attestations\" and narrowed the scope of cyber sanctions to apply only to foreign persons. However, it preserved key initiatives like the FCC's **U.S. Cyber Trust Mark** program for IoT device security and maintained the assessment of China as the nation's primary cyber threat. ### 4.3. The Role of Cyber Insurance The cyber insurance market continues to mature, with the global premium volume projected to reach **$16.3 billion** in 2025 and more than double by 2030. While a significant protection gap remains, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), insurers are increasingly driving security maturity by mandating specific controls, such as MFA, as a prerequisite for coverage. ## Strategic Outlook and Recommendations Navigating the 2025 threat landscape requires a strategic shift towards proactive, integrated, and intelligence-driven cybersecurity. 1. **Accelerate Zero Trust Adoption:** A Zero Trust architecture—which assumes no implicit trust and continuously validates every stage of digital interaction—is no longer optional. This requires comprehensive implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA), the principle of least privilege, and micro-segmentation to contain threats and limit lateral movement. 2. **Enhance Supply Chain & Third-Party Risk Management:** Given the prevalence of attacks via third parties, organizations must move beyond questionnaires to continuous monitoring and technical validation of their partners' security postures. Cybersecurity requirements must be embedded in contracts. 3. **Develop a Robust AI Security and Governance Program:** Organizations must establish formal governance frameworks (e.g., NIST AI RMF) to manage the risks of \"shadow AI\" and secure models against unique threats like data poisoning and evasion. AI deployment must be treated with the same security rigor as any other critical technology. 4. **Strengthen Incident Response and Readiness:** With mandatory disclosure timelines shrinking, organizations must have comprehensive, well-tested Incident Response Plans. Regular tabletop exercises and simulations involving technical, legal, and executive teams are critical to ensure a coordinated and compliant response. 5. **Prioritize Foundational Hygiene:** Amidst advanced threats, mastering the fundamentals remains paramount. This includes rigorous asset management, continuous vulnerability scanning, timely patching, secure configuration management, and comprehensive network logging and monitoring. These basics are the most effective defense against both opportunistic criminals and sophisticated state actors. ## Read more [**FBI Strikes Major Blow Against Global Cybercrime: BreachForums Seizure Disrupts Elite Hacking Network** \\ \\ International law enforcement operation dismantles marketplace used by ShinyHunters, Baphomet, and IntelBroker amid massive Salesforce extortion campaign\\ October 2025 — In a coordinated international law enforcement operation, the FBI and French authorities have seized control of BreachForums, one of the world's most notorious cybercrime marketplaces, dealing a significant blow](https://breached.company/fbi-strikes-major-blow-against-global-cybercrime-breachforums-seizure-disrupts-elite-hacking-network/)[**Spain Dismantles Major Banking Phishing Network: The Fall of the GXC Team** \\ \\ Digital Nomad Behind Multi-Million Dollar Credential Theft Operation Arrested\\ Spain's Civil Guard has successfully dismantled one of the most sophisticated phishing operations in the Spanish-speaking world, arresting the 25-year-old Brazilian mastermind behind the GXC Team and disrupting a Crime-as-a-Service empire that facilitated millions of dollars in theft across](https://breached.company/spain-dismantles-major-banking-phishing-network-the-fall-of-the-gxc-team/)[**Major Data Breach Hits Online Casinos Through Third-Party CRM Provider Fast Track** \\ \\ October 2025 — The online gambling industry is grappling with a significant cybersecurity incident after Fast Track, a prominent Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software provider serving the iGaming sector, confirmed that two of its casino clients were compromised in what the company describes as a \"highly sophisticated cyberattack.\"\\ The](https://breached.company/major-data-breach-hits-online-casinos-through-third-party-crm-provider-fast-track/)[**Qantas Data Breach: 5 Million Customer Records Leaked as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Escalate Global Extortion Campaign** \\ \\ Major Airline Falls Victim to Sophisticated Cybercrime Coalition in Year-Long Supply Chain Attack\\ Australia's flagship carrier Qantas Airways has become the latest high-profile victim of an aggressive extortion campaign orchestrated by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, a notorious cybercriminal coalition that has targeted dozens of Fortune 500 companies in what](https://breached.company/qantas-data-breach-5-million-customer-records-leaked-as-scattered-lapsus-hunters-escalate-global-extortion-campaign/)",

    "full_text": "# India's Geographic Vulnerability to Climate Change Industry Updates 17 mins September 25, 2024 Manasvi Patel ## **World Environmental Health Day 2024** World Environmental Health Day 2024 focuses on the theme \"Environmental Health: Creating Resilient Communities through Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation.\" This theme underscores the critical need to enhance community resilience in the face of climate-related disasters, which have become increasingly frequent and severe due to global warming. By emphasizing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation, this year's theme calls for integrated approaches that not only protect public health but also ensure sustainable development. India's unique geography and climate make it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. With 27 out of 29 states and 7 union territories susceptible to natural hazards like floods, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes, the country faces an uphill battle against the devastating impacts of climate change. As World Environmental Health Day 2024 approaches, it's crucial for India to take bold steps to enhance community resilience and protect its vulnerable populations. ### Geographical Factors Contributing to Disaster Risk India's geographical factors significantly contribute to its disaster risk profile, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The combination of its diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors creates a complex landscape of [vulnerabilities](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf): - [**Earthquakes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.7059oimyb6r3): Approximately 58.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to earthquakes, with the country situated in a seismically active zone due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. - [**Coastal Vulnerability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.sipw79xc52s): India's coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, exposes it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. - [**Floods**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.af8gn4f1799i) and [**droughts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.xdkivgfc02df): about 40 million hectares (around 12% of the land) are prone to floods and river erosion, while 68% of cultivable land is vulnerable to droughts. - [**Landslides**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaTxJR8MZ8PvWWj3yzf2TdFInbyWe-Ra-M5j8CmRLJw/edit#heading=h.kmor8crhvnf7) and avalanches: The hilly regions are also at risk from landslides and avalanches, further compounding the disaster risk faced by various communities across the nation. #### Seismic Activity India is situated at the convergence of several tectonic plates, making it prime for earthquakes. ~58% of the country’s landmass is classified as being at risk for earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity. This seismic vulnerability is particularly pronounced in regions such as the Himalayan belt, which experiences tremors due to ongoing tectonic activity. ##### The Gujarat (Bhuj) Earthquake (2001) For instance, the [2001 Bhuj earthquake](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bhuj-earthquake-of-2001), which registered a magnitude of 7.7, resulted in over 20,000 deaths and injured more than 150,000 others. The earthquake affected approximately 28 million people, destroyed more than 400,000 buildings, with the telecom building collapsing, Bhuj was isolated from the rest of the state; the most seriously affected was the Kandla port (the busiest port in India) which caters to handling crucial imports of petroleum products, crude oil and chemicals and export of agricultural commodities, with about five of the 10 jetties damaged. Over 10,000 small and medium industrial units had to stop production due to damage to plants, factories, and machinery. The Indian State Department [estimates](https://www.adrc.asia/publications/recovery_reports/Gujarat.pdf) that the earthquake affected, directly or indirectly, 15.9 million people out of 37.8 million. The government estimated the direct economic loss at $1.3 billion, while estimates indicate this could be as high as $5 billion. Following the earthquake, emergency relief operations were launched by both government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs): - [ActionAid India](https://www.actionaidindia.org/emergency/gujarat-earthquake-2001/) mobilized local community-based organizations to provide immediate assistance in the most affected areas, by establishing temporary shelters, distributed food and medical supplies, and set up psycho-social counseling services for survivors. - The government initiated a [comprehensive rehabilitation plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm) that included new building codesto ensure that the structures were designed to be earthquake-resistant; and infrastructure redevelopment of roads, schools, hospitals, and utilities was prioritized. - Emphasizing on community participation in planning and implementing disaster management strategies, village-level committees were formed to enhance local capacity for disaster response. - A [State Disaster Management Plan](https://www.drmonline.net/drmlibrary/gujarat.htm#:~:text=Gujarat%20State%20Disaster%20Management%20Authority%20(GSDMA)%2C%20which%20would%20implement%20the%20reconstruction%20and%20rehabilitation%2C%20with%20support%20from%20various%20other%20agencies%20in%20the%20quake%2Dhit%20area.) was created that integrated lessons learned from the earthquake, and focused on risk assessment, early warning systems, and community-based disaster management practices aimed at reducing vulnerability to future seismic events. The resilience-building activities undertaken after the Gujarat earthquake reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate relief with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. These efforts underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in seismically active regions like India #### Coastal Vulnerability India's long coastline of 7,516 km, with approximately 5,700 km exposed to severe weather events, makes it highly vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis, [exposing](https://irade.org/Sustainable%20and%20Disaster%20Resilient%20Urban%20DevelopmentFinal%20.pdf) it to nearly 10% of the world’s tropical cyclones. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced in states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, which have borne the brunt of devastating cyclones in recent years. ###### Cyclone Fani (2019) Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, serves as a prime example of the destruction that coastal areas face. The [extremely severe](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cyclone-fani-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment) cyclonic storm caused extensive damage across 14 districts in Odisha, [affecting](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2019-000041-ind) at least 10 million people in the North-eastern Sates of India. Despite the early evacuation of a million people, the cyclone has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of more than 28 million people across 3 States in India. [Total damage](https://ncds.nic.in/sites/default/files/OEDS3NCDS.pdf) to existing stock of assets has been estimated at over $2.4 billion, whereas the economic losses flowing from the disaster are estimated at nearly ~$1.1 billion. In response to the devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, several resilience-building activities were implemented to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts: - [The Government of Odisha](https://www.unicef.org/media/82111/file/India-Cyclone-Fani-SitRep-12-May-2019.pdf) coordinated one of the largest emergency preparedness exercises, mobilizing over 45,000 volunteers and 100,000 officials to ensure effective communication and evacuation protocols. This effort enabled the successful evacuation of approximately 1.47 million people from low-lying areas before the cyclone made landfall. - The state government constructed hundreds of cyclone shelters along the coast to provide safe refuge during storms, which were stocked with essentials like food and water. - Local stakeholders, NGOs, and civil society organizations collaborated with the government to conduct training programs on disaster preparedness including educating communities about evacuation routes and safety measures The resilience-building activities undertaken after Cyclone Fani reflect a comprehensive approach that combines immediate response efforts with long-term strategies aimed at enhancing community preparedness and reducing vulnerability to future disasters. The lessons learned from this cyclone underscore the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning to safeguard lives and livelihoods in coastal regions like Odisha. #### Flood-Prone Areas Over 40 million hectares (about 12% of India’s land) is [prone to floods and river erosion](https://nidm.gov.in/easindia2014/err/pdf/country_profile/India.pdf). The monsoon season often brings heavy rainfall leading to river overflow and flash floods, particularly in states like Assam and Bihar. ##### Assam Floods (2023) Assam, a state in northeastern India, is characterized by its fertile Brahmaputra Valley, which supports a rich agricultural sector. The state’s agriculture is primarily based on rice, tea, and jute, and it benefits from the regular monsoon rains that sustain its crops. The geographical features of Assam, including its river basins and low-lying areas, contribute significantly to its susceptibility to flooding. In 2023, Assam experienced devastating floods that [impacted](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/india-whats-really-behind-assams-worsening-floods) over 2.5 million people. In response to the challenges posed by flooding, particularly following the severe floods in 2023, several resilience-building activities have been undertaken in Assam: - The Assam government allocated Rs 1200 crs in 2023-24 for the [construction and maintenance](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=Infrastructure%20Development%3A%20The%20Assam%20government%20has%20allocated%20Rs%201%2C200%20crore%20for%20the%20construction%20and%20maintenance%20of%20flood%20control%20infrastructure%2C%20including%20embankments%20and%20flood%20barriers%2C%20for%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20period.) of flood control infrastructure, including embarkments and drainage systems and investment aimed to enhance the state's capacity to manage floodwaters effectively and reduce the risk of future inundations. - The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) invested ₹25 crores in developing advanced flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems provide alerts up to three days in advance, allowing communities to prepare for impending floods and evacuate if necessary. - The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) [covers](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/assams-agriculture-and-floods-challenges-and-strategies-for-resilience#:~:text=The%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Fasal%20Bima%20Yojana%20(PMFBY)%20covers%20around%2056%25%20of%20the%20farmers%20in%20Assam%20as%20of%202023.%20This%20scheme%20provides%20insurance%20coverage%20against%20crop%20losses%20due%20to%20natural%20calamities.) around 56% of farmers in Assam as of 2023, providing insurance against crop losses due to natural calamities. This scheme is crucial for protecting farmers' livelihoods and ensuring financial support during disasters. - A Community-Based Disaster Management project was launched in 2023, aimed at building local capacity for flood management in 100 selected gram panchayats focusing on on empowering communities with knowledge and resources to respond effectively to floods. In 2023, Assam introduced a ' [green budget](https://www.open-contracting.org/2023/09/28/improving-climate-resilience-in-flood-prone-assam-india/)' committing approximately $2 billion towards climate change action and disaster risk reduction, aiming to enhance long-term resilience against climate-related disasters through sustainable development practices. The resilience-building activities implemented in Assam following recent floods reflect a proactive approach to disaster risk reduction. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, promoting community engagement, and introducing innovative financial mechanisms like insurance schemes and green budgets, Assam is working towards building a more resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding the impacts of flooding. #### Drought and Water Scarcity Drought and water scarcity are significant challenges in India, with [about](https://nidm.gov.in/pdf/trgReports/2021/July/Report_29July2021sk.pdf) 68% of the country's cultivable area vulnerable to these conditions. ##### Rajasthan Drought and Water Scarcity Rajasthan, the largest state in India, faces significant challenges related to water scarcity and drought leading to crop failures and economic distress among farmers. The state has [limited water resources](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/261801490687132806/pdf/113703-WP-Water-Assessment-and-Potential-for-Private-Sector-Interventions-PUBLIC.pdf), with only 1.16% of India's total water supply, making it particularly susceptible to prolonged drought conditions. It's among the most [vulnerable to droughts](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/29/surajpura-rajasthan-india-drought-villagers-farmers-climate#:~:text=ajasthan%2C%20India%E2%80%99s%20largest%20state%2C%20is%20among%20the%20most%20vulnerable%20to%20droughts%2C%20with%2098%25%20of%20its%20250%20village%20blocks%20in%20sectors%20marked%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdark%20zones%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20areas%20with%20dangerously%20low%20groundwater%20levels%20%E2%80%93%20and%20almost%207%25%20of%20the%20land%20uncultivable), with 98% of its 250 village blocks in sectors marked as “dark zones” – areas with dangerously low groundwater levels – and almost 7% of the land uncultivable. In response to the recurring drought conditions, several resilience-building activities have been implemented in Rajasthan: - Rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques were introduced to mitigate the effects of droughts and were prioritized via traditional techniques such as Anictus, Bairis, and tanks. In 2023, after an [unusually high rainfall](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/climate-opportunity-how-did-rajasthan-harvest-rainwater-after-the-early-monsoon-of-2023--94579) of 588.9 mm (nearly 2X the normal amount) villagers utilized these methods to direct the water into ponds and storage system, providing drinking water [for upto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwXQurAJLKs) 1.5 years in some villages. - The Rajasthan Water Sector Restructuring Project, costing a total of $495 million, of which $345 million is [financed](https://www.ndb.int/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rajasthan-Water-00012.pdf) by the New Development Bank, aimed to rehabilitate the Indira Gandhi Canal System, covering over 990 km of canal systems, reclamation of more than 33,000 km of waterlogged areas, and implementation of micro-irrigation techniques. Government schemes like the [Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana](https://pmksy.gov.in/) (PMKSY) were implemented to focus on enhancing irrigation facilities, along with the introduction of a crop insurance scheme to protect farmers from losses due to drought. Despite these resilience-building efforts, Rajasthan continues to face the challenges posed by recurring droughts. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by its arid climate, limited water resources, and high dependence on agriculture. Sustained efforts and investments in water management, and agricultural practices are crucial for mitigating the impact of droughts and ensuring food security in the region. #### Topography and Landslides India's diverse topography includes mountainous regions that are particularly vulnerable to landslides and avalanches, especially during the monsoon season. The Himalayan region, along with the Western Ghats, experiences heavy rainfall that can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. One of the most devastating recent events occurred in Wayanad, Kerala, where a series of landslides on July 30, 2024, resulted in significant loss of life and property. ##### The Wayanad Landslides (2024) On July 30, 2024, Wayanad district in Kerala was struck by catastrophic landslides that resulted from extreme rainfall. [The region](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece) received 572 mm of rainfall within 48 hours leading up to the disaster, causing hillsides to collapse in the villages of Mundakkai and Chooralmala. This resulted in over 336 fatalities, ~397 were injured, and at least 118 missing. The debris flow altered the course of the Iruvanjipuzha River, exacerbating flooding conditions in surrounding areas. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) [reported](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/86000-sq-metres-of-land-slipped-away-debris-travelled-8-km-along-iruvanjippuzha-river-isro-satellite-images-reveal/articleshow/112231968.cms?from=mdr) that about 86,000 square meters of land had shifted due to the landslide. In response to the Wanayd landslides, several activities were initiated: - A [rescue operation](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-landslide-how-two-villages-vanished-overnight/article68506601.ece#:~:text=On%20August%201%2C%20Chief%20Minister%20Pinarayi%20Vijayan%20said%20over%209%2C300%20people%20were%20staying%20in%2091%20relief%20camps%20in%20Wayanad%20district.) was mobilized involving the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local authorities, over 9,300 people were accommodated in relief camps across the district. - [Experts](https://india.mongabay.com/2024/08/commentary-on-the-trail-of-the-wayanad-landslide/) have called for implementing site-specific land-use policies and improving drainage management to mitigate future risks. Additionally, establishing local landslide early warning systems (LEWS) has been recommended to enhance community preparedness. The Wayanad landslides highlight the urgent need for improved land management practices and disaster preparedness in vulnerable regions of India. By implementing effective resilience-building strategies, including community engagement and infrastructure improvements, it is possible to mitigate the impacts of future landslides and protect lives and livelihoods. India's unique geographical factors significantly contribute to its vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's diverse topography, climatic conditions, and demographic factors create a complex landscape of risks, including earthquakes, coastal vulnerability, floods, droughts, landslides, and avalanches. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events due to global warming. To address these challenges, India must adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into its development plans. Building resilient communities requires a multi-faceted strategy that includes strengthening early warning systems, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and adopting sustainable practices.

Further, the report describes the significance of interconnectors during geopolitical instability and war, using examples from Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic States. Recommendations are provided on both deploying new interconnection capacity, and securing the existing infrastructure. ### Featured in the media [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/09/25/why-portugal-and-spain-are-the-most-vulnerable-european-countries-to-blackouts) [Dziennik Gazeta Prawna](https://serwisy.gazetaprawna.pl/energetyka/artykuly/9894781,europejska-recepta-na-bezpieczenstwo-energetyczne-spor-o-interkonekto.html) [Montel](https://montelnews.com/news/a64d559f-0eac-4ad2-837a-0fdb49914ae6/poor-cross-border-links-cause-europe-blackout-risk-think-tank) [El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.es/energia/noticias/13559468/09/25/irlanda-espana-y-finlandia-son-los-paises-mas-expuestos-a-apagones-de-europa-por-falta-de-interconexiones.html) [Dagens industri](https://www.di.se/nyheter/forskare-varnar-finlands-elnat-extra-sarbart-for-hybridattacker/) [La Libre](https://www.lalibre.be/international/europe/2025/09/24/plus-de-la-moitie-du-reseau-electrique-europeen-presente-un-risque-de-black-out-3ZVHPVFZNREAZA7TXGKILVADSE/) [Review Energy](https://www.review-energy.com/otras-fuentes/the-biggest-problem-is-short-term-thinking-grid-projects-are-long-term-investments-pawel-czyzak-ember) [nu.nl](https://www.nu.nl/klimaat/6370031/ruim-de-helft-van-europees-stroomnet-loopt-risico-op-uitval-kost-mensenlevens.html?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.meltwater.com%2F) ## Interconnectors keep power flowing through disruptions #### **Without interconnectors, Europe could have experienced two additional major blackouts in the last five years, and the Iberian one could have been much more severe.** Countries like Ukraine, Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, would’ve been fully exposed to Russia’s energy blackmail, with dire political and social consequences. Playing a key role in the stability of the European continent, existing interconnectors need to be secured from sabotage, and new projects need to be planned and deployed, especially in regions with the highest risk of technical or political incidents, such as the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe. - **Three blackouts** in the EUwere avoided or managed thanks to European interconnectors in the last 5 years. - **Ukraine and Moldova** would’ve faced severe power loss due to Russia’s aggression, if not for cross-border electricity exchange with EU neighbours. - **55% of Europe’s power system has limited electricity import options,** increasing the risk of blackouts. Spain, Ireland and Finland are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents. - **Nine recent cases of Baltic Sea infrastructure sabotage** show the need to protect Europe’s interconnection infrastructure. Europe’s energy infrastructure is under attack, with Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign escalating every day. Interconnectors form the backbone of energy security, safeguarding Europe against grid failures and geopolitical threats. The more interconnectors we have, and the better we secure our existing infrastructure, the safer we are in the face of sabotage. The expansion and security of European grids needs to be treated not as an energy priority, but as a vital element of protecting European society against attacks. **Dr Pawel Czyzak‍** Europe Programme Director, Ember Grid security is rudimentary to reducing Europe’s dependence on adversarial actors who have long used energy as a tool of economic coercion, dictating growth and productivity, and undermining stability across the continent. The much-needed push for low-carbon, domestic energy production must be matched by investment in grid modernisation to sustain large-scale electrification, strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy, and power its modern economy. **Isabelle Dupraz‍** Deputy Director, European Initiative for Energy Security ## **Interconnectors help stabilise or restart grids after faults** #### **Several examples show how interconnectors helped stabilise grids during incidents that could have otherwise had much more severe consequences.** ### European interconnectors made recent grid stress events less severe While European power systems maintain excellent reliability standards, multiple events in the past have put grids to a test. In those moments, interconnectors played a key role in stabilising the power systems and preventing widespread power cuts, or restarting the system if a blackout did occur. **Prevention: interconnectors helped avoid two potential blackouts in Poland** On 17th May 2021, a human error led to the malfunction of a high-voltage substation in Poland – Rogowiec. The substation feeds power from the largest power plant in the country – Bełchatów, into the Polish grid. The incident suddenly disconnected around 3.5 GW of capacity from the system and led to a [158 mHz](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2022/220318_Final_report_Rogowiec_incident.pdf) frequency drop, just shy of the [200 mHz buffer](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2019/190522_SOC_TOP_11.6_Task%20Force%20Significant%20Frequency%20Deviations_External%20Report.pdf) that would put the system in an emergency state. The Continental Europe Synchronous Area absorbed the frequency deviation by ramping up flows from neighbouring countries. These flows instantly reached [4.5 GW](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/news/2022/220318_Final_report_Rogowiec_incident.pdf) – 2.3 GW more than allowed. Significant load appeared on power lines in Western Poland – 5 lines were operating at above 100% capacity, two of them above 120%, posing a risk of overloading. These violations were resolved by the Polish and German transmission system operators (TSOs), who limited flows and restored the frequency to nominal value within 30 minutes. Immediately after the incident, the Polish TSO requested emergency support from neighbouring countries to rebuild capacity reserves. Interconnectors were initially essential to prevent further frequency drops, the tripping of generators and cascading failures. Then they became key to rebuilding the system’s reserves while the grid malfunction was being removed. Another stressful event happened in Poland on 22nd June 2020, when heavy rainfall damaged coal supply lines. This, along with several other random failures, led to a record unplanned generation loss of [5.7 GW](https://bip.mos.gov.pl/fileadmin/user_upload/bip/Energetyka/Sprawozdania_z_wynikow_monitorowania_bezpieczenstwa_dostaw_energii_elektrycznej/Sprawozdanie_MKiS_z_monitorowania_bezpieczenstwa_dostaw_energii_elektrycznej_za_okres_2019-2020_tekst_ostateczny.pdf), equivalent to a quarter of that day’s peak demand. The event wasn’t as sudden as the one in 2021, and the frequency was not disrupted, so the incident didn’t require a formal investigation. However, the Polish TSO had to request emergency imports from neighbouring countries and deployed almost all coal plants available in “cold reserve” – plants used only in emergency situations. If interconnectors hadn’t provided [3 GW](https://www.next-kraftwerke.com/energy-blog/fossil-energy-poland) of power, a blackout would have been a real possibility. Only around [2 GW of coal and pumped-storage](https://wysokienapiecie.pl/30318-zalalo-elektrownie-prad-po-1300-zl-mwh/) capacity was left in the system, meaning 1 GW of demand could not have been balanced, leading to voluntary or forced reductions. **Stability: interconnectors filled France’s generation gap throughout 2022** France has recently faced major generation gaps due to nuclear plant outages. Historically, the country was the biggest exporter of electricity in Europe. However, in 2022, the total electricity generation dropped from 550 TWh in 2021 to 468 TWh – a decrease of 15%. Flows switched from [net exports of 42 TWh in 2021 to net imports of 17 TWh](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/european-electricity-review-2023/the-big-picture/#insight-1-the-fallacy-of-europes-return-to-coal). Peak imports reached 11 GW – 75% of the total interconnector capacity. In certain moments, imports covered up to 17% of the country’s peak electricity demand. While French nuclear has rebounded since 2022, the fleet still experiences outages, especially during [heatwaves](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/heat-and-power-impacts-of-the-2025-heatwave-in-europe/). In those moments interconnectors continue filling the capacity gaps, reducing price spikes as well. **Recovery: interconnectors restarted the Iberian grid after the blackout** On 28th April 2025, Spain and Portugal were hit by the largest blackout in Europe’s modern history, leaving around 60 million people without electricity for hours. [Multiple causes](https://www.compasslexecon.com/insights/publications/analysis-of-events-leading-to-the-peninsular-blackout-of-april-28th) led to the incident, and a final report by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) is due in October 2025. What is already certain is that, after the blackout, interconnectors were essential in restarting the Iberian power system. Just 10 minutes after the blackout, the first [France-Spain power line](https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/blackout/28-april-2025-iberian-blackout/) was reenergised, soon joined by the interconnector with Morocco and other connections with France. With the help of hydro and gas units, a full restoration was achieved in Spain around 4 AM on 29th April, around 16 hours after the incident. The Iberian Peninsula is more vulnerable to blackout risks than other European countries due to limited connections to the continental grid. Following the blackout, Spain and Portugal urged the EU to [back new interconnector projects](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/spain-portugal-ask-eu-push-power-links-with-france-after-outage-2025-05-21/), citing stronger links as essential to preventing future disruptions. The 2021 blackout in Texas offers a stark warning of what can happen if connectivity isn’t sufficient. In February 2021, severe cold weather left more than 4.5 million people without power for several days, causing [250 deaths](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/02/texas-winter-storm-final-death-toll-246/). With peak demand above 70 GW but just 1 GW of interconnection, the state was unable to stabilise frequency deviations or replace the [34 GW](https://www.ferc.gov/media/february-2021-cold-weather-outages-texas-and-south-central-united-states-ferc-nerc-and) of missing capacity through imports, leading to a quick collapse. Restarting the system after the blackout was difficult as well – with fossil gas generators rendered unavailable, interconnectors could not be used to resynchronise the system, as was the case after the Iberian blackout. This is why exploring additional interconnection was one of the recommendations of the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission](https://www.ferc.gov/media/february-2021-cold-weather-outages-texas-and-south-central-united-states-ferc-nerc-and) that analysed the blackout. ### Up to 55% of Europe’s power system has limited electricity import options, increasing the risk of blackouts The more cross-border capacity a country has, the more stability can be provided by neighbours during grid stress events. This can be measured by the ratio of interconnector capacity (in the import direction) and a country’s peak electricity demand. This ratio varies from 12% in Poland, to almost 200% in Latvia – a country that has relatively small domestic demand, but supports electricity transits between Central Europe, the Baltics and the Nordics. However, there is no guarantee that imports from neighbours will be available instantly and at full capacity. That is why diversification is key: the more neighbours a country is connected to, the higher the chance that cross-border support can be provided on short notice. Summing the peak electricity demand of countries with three or fewer import directions and an import potential ratio of 25% or lower, up to 55% of Europe’s power system can be considered at risk due to limited emergency import options. Three countries – Spain, Ireland and Finland – are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents. ## Interconnectors provide security in times of uncertainty and war #### **Being essential for Europe during Russia’s aggression, interconnectors have also become targets of sabotage.** ### Interconnectors helped when power systems were attacked Interconnectors have a key role in stabilising power systems after a fault. But the past three years have also highlighted their other security feature – delivering stable electricity even during war. **Keeping the grid alive during Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure** Before 2022, Ukraine’s power system was connected to the Russian and Belarusian ones. On the day of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine requested an emergency synchronisation with the European power system. This was achieved in a record time of just [3 weeks](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/2-years-ukraine-and-moldova-synchronised-electricity-grids-eu-2024-03-15_en). This proved to be a critical security move since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine included [multiple attacks](https://dixigroup.org/en/over-two-years-russia-has-carried-out-25-massive-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-sector/) on energy infrastructure. By May 2024, about [70% of Ukraine’s thermal generation capacity was either occupied or damaged](https://www.iea.org/reports/ukraines-energy-security-and-the-coming-winter/ukraines-energy-system-under-attack), compromising the country’s ability to meet domestic demand. Fortunately, up to [2.4 GW](https://ember-energy.org/data/europe-electricity-interconnection-data-tool/) of import capacity was available for Ukraine – equivalent to 20% of the peak demand – including emergency response schemes by neighbouring grid operators. Thanks to interconnectors, during the [most severe attacks](https://map.ua-energy.org/en/datasets/12f3148d-841a-478d-b9ed-72bf0764b286) on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in 2024, Ukraine imported over 800 GWh of electricity a month, though a capacity gap still remained, leading to [local power cuts](https://www.iea.org/reports/ukraines-energy-security-and-the-coming-winter/ukraines-energy-system-under-attack). Imports totalled 4 TWh in 2024, a striking shift from Ukraine’s historical role as an exporter of around 2 TWh of electricity a year in pre-war 2020 and 2021. **Stabilising Moldova ahead of parliamentary elections** Similarly to Ukraine, Moldova’s power system used to be synchronised with Russia and Belarus. In 2022 it also went through an emergency synchronisation process, using interconnectors with Romania – which again proved to be an effective security move. On 31st December 2024, Russia stopped supplying gas to Moldova’s largest power plant, in an effort to destabilise the country ahead of parliamentary elections. Moldova was forced to source up to [62%](https://adevarul.ro/stiri-externe/republica-moldova/criza-energetica-in-rep-moldova-o-mare-parte-2412020.html) of electricity demand from Romania. Fortunately, thanks to grid investments, Moldova’s energy security will soon be strengthened. A new interconnection, [Vulcanesti – Chisinau](https://ipn.md/en/the-vulcanesti-chisinau-highway-will-be-completed-by-the-end-of-the-year-says-the-minister/), is due to be deployed by the end of 2025, providing up to 80-90% of Moldova’s peak demand in emergency situations and ensuring independence from Russia. [Two other interconnectors](https://old.gov.md/en/content/construction-balti-suceava-power-linemodernization-balti-power-station-declared-national) are being constructed, Balti-Suceava, due in 2027, and Straseni-Gutinas, due in 2030, allowing for the full integration of Moldova with the European power grid. **Shielding Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from Russia’s energy blackmail** Once reliant on Russia’s power grid, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were [fully synchronised](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/02/09/entso-e-confirms-successful-synchronization-of-the-continental-european-electricity-system-with-the-systems-of-the-baltic-countries/) with Europe’s grid and decoupled from Russia on 9th February 2025. The [Baltic Synchronisation](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/cef-energy-instrumental-funding-achieve-baltic-synchronisation-continental-european-network_en) was one of the EU’s biggest grid projects, receiving 1.2 billion EUR of support from the Connecting Europe Facility. The decoupling of Baltic States from Russia was made possible thanks to [new cross-border connections](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/timeline-phases_en) between Poland and Lithuania ( [LitPol Link](https://tyndp-data.netlify.app/tyndp2018/projects/projects/123)), and between Estonia and Latvia, as well as existing connections between Estonia and Finland ( [EstLink and EstLink 2](https://www.nib.int/articles/estlink-2-to-tie-baltic-power-producers-closer-to-the-nordic-markets)), and Lithuania and Sweden ( [NordBalt](https://www.nkt.com/references/nordbalt-the-baltic-sea)). To further strengthen the energy security of the Baltics, a new interconnector between Lithuania and Poland is being planned: [HarmonyLink](https://www.pse.pl/web/pse-eng/-/pse-and-litgrid-signed-cooperation-agreement-to-build-harmony-link-interconnector-as-overland-line), due in 2030. ### Infrastructure sabotage is now a key threat Because interconnections play a key role in Europe’s security, they’ve recently come under attack. Since 2022, [nine incidents](https://gbv.wilsoncenter.org/article/mapping-undersea-infrastructure-attacks-baltic-sea) of infrastructure damage have been recorded in the Baltic Sea. These include five cases of communication cable disruption, and damage done to the Nord Stream and Balticconnector gas pipelines and the EstLink 2 power cable. The damage done to the EstLink 2 interconnector by a [Russian shadow-fleet vessel](https://www.euronews.com/2025/08/11/finland-charges-officers-of-russia-linked-eagle-s-ship-that-damaged-undersea-cables) decreased Estonia’s electricity import capacity by 27% just two months before the full [decoupling of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from the Russian power grid](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2025/02/09/entso-e-confirms-successful-synchronization-of-the-continental-european-electricity-system-with-the-systems-of-the-baltic-countries/). Baltic Sea energy infrastructure is not the only one at risk. In April 2025, Russian hackers disrupted the operations of a [Norwegian hydropower facility](https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-hackers-took-control-norwegian-dam-police-chief-says/). In September 2025, over the span of just two days, a train carrying liquified gas [exploded near Vilnius](https://www.reuters.com/world/gas-explosion-prompts-lithuania-evacuate-residents-near-vilnius-rail-station-2025-09-10/), high-voltage lines were disrupted in an [arson attack](https://tvpworld.com/88818837/suspected-arson-attack-triggers-berlin-blackout), causing a partial blackout in Berlin, [19 Russian drones breached Polish airspace](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/poland-downs-drones-its-airspace-becoming-first-nato-member-fire-during-war-2025-09-10/) and [Israel carried out attacks in Qatar](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crme74p9gn2o) – one of Europe’s key gas suppliers. Since the start of the war in 2022, Russia-attributed [hackers](https://www.knowbe4.com/hubfs/Europe-Energy-Report-UK-EN.pdf) have targeted energy companies all across Europe, and globally, the [frequency of cyberattacks on energy utilities has doubled since 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/ai-and-energy-security), according to the International Energy Agency. Energy supply is critical not only for civilian life, but also for military response, and [energy infrastructure remains a major target](https://theopportunity.pl/en/publications/report-will-the-sea-help-the-baltic-sea-and-polands-energy-security/), as shown by examples from Ukraine and Russia’s [hybrid warfare](https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/08/the-scale-of-russian--sabotage-operations--against-europes-critical--infrastructure/) campaign in Europe. In the context of the Baltic power system, the role of cross-border interconnectors goes far beyond standard grid functions — they form the backbone of regional energy sovereignty and systemic resilience. The Baltic is no longer just a geographic area – it is becoming the integrated power plant of Northern and Eastern Europe, built on mutual support and diversified energy sources. Protecting this infrastructure must therefore go beyond the energy sector itself — it should be treated as part of NATO’s collective defense and the EU’s security architecture. **Zuzanna Nowak‍** Executive Director, The Opportunity Institute for Foreign Affairs ## Europe’s interconnectors need boosting and securing #### **Interconnectors are key in guaranteeing grid resilience, energy security and, more broadly, Europe’s safety. To continue providing stability against grid failures or geopolitical threats, two sets of actions need to be taken: the expansion of interconnector capacity and better security of existing infrastructure.** The upcoming [European Grid Package](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14672-European-grid-package_en) presents a timely opportunity to strengthen political commitment around both areas. European interconnection capacity is expected to [almost double](https://ember-energy.org/data/europe-electricity-interconnection-data-tool/) between 2024 and 2040, or even triple if all currently planned projects were delivered on time. Priority should be given to areas with limited connectivity and high exposure to potential disruption – such as the Iberian Peninsula, Eastern Europe and Finland. However, strategic investments will only happen with strong political commitment and [cross-border collaboration](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/central-and-eastern-europe-from-coal-to-renewables/). Worryingly, Poland, the EU’s fifth largest electricity market, has almost no interconnection expansion projects planned, despite recent near-blackout incidents and a high risk of sabotage. Yet, the country could benefit from new projects in the region: the [Baltic Energy Hub](https://www.epsog.lt/uploads/documents/files/Lietuvos%20energetikos%20vizija/Lithuania%20Energy%20System%20Transformation%20to%202050%20(EPSO-G%20presentation).pdf) and an [Eastern European transmission highway](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/in-it-together-cee-power-system/) that would secure Eastern Europe from Russia, and also enable the full integration of Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans with the European power system. Existing infrastructure needs to be secured as well. The European Commission recently proposed an [Action Plan on Cable Security](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/joint-communication-strengthen-security-and-resilience-submarine-cables) and a [Hybrid Toolbox](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/hybrid-threats/) addressing [hybrid warfare](https://www.iiss.org/research-paper/2025/08/the-scale-of-russian--sabotage-operations--against-europes-critical--infrastructure/). Denmark is researching [underwater drones](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/danish-project-to-develop-drone-for-protecting-critical-underwater-infrastructure/) that could capture and immobilise hostile underwater vehicles, NATO established a [Critical Undersea Infrastructure teams](https://www.nato.int/cps/in/natohq/news_228959.htm?selectedLocale=en) in the UK and Belgium, and already deployed at least [20 drone boats in the Baltic Sea](https://www.twz.com/news-features/drone-boats-being-rushed-to-help-prevent-baltic-seafloor-cable-sabotage). But these reactive measures must be coupled with [coordinated planning and permitting to accelerate grid investments](https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/briefs/war-footing-securing-critical-energy-infrastructure) – as more interconnections, lines and substations make the system more resilient if one of the elements is attacked. In the case of cross-border and offshore projects, this requires more [active steering by the European Commission](https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/embers-four-key-asks-for-the-new-eu-energy-commissioner/), facilitating regional collaboration and mediating between governments and financing institutions such as EIB and EBRD. [Grid enhancing technologies](https://www.secureenergyeurope.org/eies-insights-securing-the-european-grid), including digital solutions, should be incentivised in EU funding, enhancing monitoring, maintenance and recovery of grid assets. [Supply chain security](https://www.secureenergyeurope.org/eies-insights-securing-the-european-grid) is essential as well, with a priority for “made in Europe” components and digital systems. Finally, in both grid expansion and protection, [collaboration and coordination is critical](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64f5f132690bb40dc03cfaf4/t/67640a95696a37740af5fd03/1734609558137/EIES+Allied+Infrastructure+Security+Roundtable.pdf), given the group of stakeholders ranges from grid operators, through the EU, governments and financial institutions, to NATO and different branches of the military. ## Supporting materials ### **Downloads** Download the full analysis PDF.

Google said on Wednesday that China-linked hackers were breaking into a range of companies to steal sensitive national-security and economic data. Kevin Frayer via Getty Images Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have [feedback](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/contact/). WASHINGTON — Highly sophisticated hackers linked to the Chinese government are breaking into technology companies, software-as-a-service providers and legal-services firms with stealthy malware that has allowed them to quietly steal sensitive data from those companies and their customers, [Google announced on Wednesday](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/brickstorm-espionage-campaign). The hackers have pivoted from service providers to their customers’ networks, searched the emails of specific people inside legal firms and hunted for information about U.S. national security and international trade matters, according to Google. The threat actors have also stolen the source code for widely used enterprise technologies, likely as part of an effort to analyze them for undisclosed vulnerabilities that could power future attacks, Google said. In some breaches of enterprise tech vendors, they have searched the email inboxes of software developers for information about product flaws. [A China-linked group called UNC5221](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ivanti-zero-day-attacks/736932/) is conducting most of the attacks, according to Google, but because different teams often share tools, the tech giant said other China-linked groups are also likely involved. The campaign is active right now, Google cybersecurity experts told reporters on Tuesday during a briefing at the company’s Cyber Defense Summit in Washington. “This is happening in the United States, this is next-level activity, and we're only going to learn more about it over time,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). Hultquist described the campaign as “a very good intelligence operation” and said the attackers’ movement from major vendors to their customers recalled other supply-chain incidents such as [Russia’s SolarWinds espionage campaign](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/solarwinds-1-year-later-cyber-attack-orion/610990/). “It is them moving upstream where they can pick and choose their targets of interest.” ### **Hiding in the gaps** An alarming element of the campaign, Google said, is the hackers’ use of [a malware backdoor called Brickstorm](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ivanti-post-exploitation-lateral-movement) that they plant on systems that cannot run endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus software, such as VMware ESXi hypervisors, email security gateways and vulnerability scanners. Evading EDR allows them to hide for far longer than hackers typically can — Google said it has taken victims an average of 393 days to discover the intrusions, a remarkably long “dwell time” that defies recent trends in improved attack detection. Google is releasing a tool that will let companies scan their networks for evidence of Brickstorm, as well as YARA rules that companies can use to search their backups for historical evidence of intrusions. Google experts said the hackers excel at erasing their tracks. Many organizations will “find evidence of historic compromises or active compromises,” said Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer at Google’s Mandiant division. Companies that do see signs of the Brickstorm malware need to conduct a thorough investigation, he added. “This is a very, very advanced adversary.” ### **Patient adversary, long-term ripple effects** The main China-linked group responsible for the intrusions, UNC5221, “is the most prevalent adversary in the United States over the past several years” in terms of the frequency, severity and complexity of their attacks, Carmakal told reporters. UNC5221 hackers are extremely stealthy, Carmakal said, never using infrastructure hosted on the same IP address in more than one attack to avoid creating a recognizable pattern. “It’s very hard to detect them and to investigate them,” he said. The attackers are also patient. In one investigation, Google saw the hackers configure their backdoor to lie dormant for months while the victim investigated signs of an intrusion. “It’s clever, but it also shows they’re in it for the long game,” said Austin Larsen, a principal threat analyst at GTIG. Because most companies haven’t discovered the intrusions until long after their logs from the initial access timeframe are automatically deleted, Google researchers have found it difficult to identify the hackers’ means of initial access. But the company said evidence points to the attackers “compromising perimeter and remote access infrastructure,” including Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs and several other edge devices. UNC5221 has been one of the primary groups [exploiting](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ivanti-zero-day-attacks/736932/) Ivanti [vulnerabilities](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-exploiting-critical-ivanti-vulnerability?e=48754805) over the past two years. Google experts declined to identify any of the victims, including the companies that have been hacked because of supplier breaches, as many of those victims are still remediating the intrusions. The company said it was publicizing the ongoing campaign now because it wanted to learn more about the extent of the attacks and to warn potential victims. The impact of the campaign will continue to resonate “six- to twelve- to eighteen- to twenty-four months from now,” Carmakal said, “because over that time, there will be new things that will come out \\[and\\] there will be new victims that disclose \\[breaches\\].” - [purchase licensing rights](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl=https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/china-espionage-supply-chain-cyberattack-backdoor-malware/760917/) Filed Under:[Breaches,](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/breaches/)[Cyberattacks,](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/cyberattacks/)[Threats](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/topic/threats/) ### Cybersecurity Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Email: - Select user consent:By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.informatechtarget.com/terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.informatechtarget.com/privacy-policy/).

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years.

Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement. Some analysts speculate that the CAA will be followed by an exercise to compile the National Register of Citizens, requiring everyone to provide evidence of their citizenship and declaring those unable to do so as foreigners.[36](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: Citizenship Amendment Act is a blow to Indian constitutional values and international standards,’ 14 March 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/india-citizenship-amendment-act-is-a-blow-to-indian-constitutional-values-and-international-standards/) Combined with the CAA, this would effectively render those Muslims who are unable to provide citizenship documents stateless. Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

Due to its geographical location, seismic risk zone and intertropical convergence point, the Indian subcontinent also faces recurring atmospheric phenomena: heavy monsoon rains, floods, episodes of high heat, drought, etc. In addition, the high population density in risk areas further aggravates the situation. The number of human casualties continues to rise, from 1 674 deaths in 2015 to 2 045 in 2019. According to the report of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the total number of people who died between 2 000 and 2 019 is 79 732. During the same period, India had reported 321 catastrophic events. It is the third country in the world in terms of the number of [natural disasters](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/natural-disasters-in-2021), behind China and the United States. According to the same report, India has suffered nearly 80 billion USD in economic losses in 20 years. ## Breakdown of natural disasters in India per type of event and nature of losses | Natural disasters | Material loss | Human loss | | --- | --- | --- | | **Floods** | 52% | 63% | 32% | | **Hurricanes** | 30% | 19% | 32% | | **Landslides** | 10% | - | 2% | | **Earthquakes** | 5% | 10% | 33% | | **Droughts** | 3% | 5% | 1% | | Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | **Source :** World Bank Some of the most frequent disasters include : **Floods** After China, India is the second country hardest hit by floods with no less than 17 of such events annually, affecting 345 million Indians. This scourge has caused a significant number of casualties and major economic damage to infrastructure, property, livelihoods and crops. Heavy monsoon rains in the eastern part of the country often cause the Brahmaputra River to overflow, with disastrous consequences. According to the 2019 Global Climate Risk Index report, floods account for 52% of the total calamities affecting India, claiming 63% of the material damage and 32% of the human losses reported as natural disasters. On an annual average, 7.500.000 hectares are flooded, and 1.600 lives are lost. **Earthquakes** The probability of an earthquake is high in India, with nearly 60% of the territory being classified as a moderate to severe seismic risk zone. According to seismologists, the Himalayas, one of the regions most exposed to earthquakes, should one day suffer a mega-shock caused by the pressure accumulated in the subsoil of the Himalayan arc. The last earthquake to date occurred in 2015. With a magnitude of 7.8, the earthquake killed 9 000 people and injured more than 20 000 others. More than 600 000 homes were also destroyed by the tremor. **Cyclones** Located in the intertropical convergence zone, the Indian subcontinent is one of the regions most affected by cyclones. Its coastline stretching over more than 8 000 kilometers accounts for nearly 10% of the world's tropical cyclones, the majority of which emerge over the Bay of Bengal and strike the east coast of India. On average, six to eight depressions form each year, two or three of which turn into tropical cyclones. A major cyclone (category 3 or more) develops every two years. In May 2020, [Cyclone Amphan](https://www.atlas-mag.net/en/article/cyclone-amphan-15-billion-usd-of-economic-losses-in-south-asia), devastated India and Bangladesh, killing 84 people and devastating the coastal areas of both countries. It was the most powerful cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 cyclone that killed 10 000 people in Odisha State (northeast India). **Heat waves and droughts** Extreme temperatures and resulting weather conditions significantly affect the health of residents and the agricultural sector. With global warming, these episodes of intense heat, more than 50 degrees, are becoming increasingly frequent. According to Indian authorities, in the last four years the country has reported no less than 4 620 deaths caused by heat waves which generally occur between March and June. The last event of this kind occurred in June 2019, claiming the lives of 50 people in 24 hours. Over the past 20 years, India has also sustained the two most severe droughts in the world. They took place in 2002 and 2015 and affected 300 and 330 million Indians, respectively. Despite the affordability of coverage and the intensity and frequency of natural events, the penetration rate of natural catastrophe insurance in India is almost nil, with less than 1% of the population contracting an insurance policy for this type of risk. For several years, the authorities have been planning to set up a national pool dedicated to natural disasters, a structure struggling to see the light of day. ## List of major natural disasters that have occurred over the last 20 years in India | Date | Place | Nature of the event | Economic losses | Insured losses | Number of fatalities | Number of affected persons | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | (in billion USD) | | **May 2020** | West Bengal | Hurricane Amphan | 13.5 | ND | 103 | 500 000 homeless | | **August 2018** | Kerala | Floods | 3.52 | 0.37 | 504 | 223 139 homeless | | **November 2015** | Chennai (Tamil Nadu) | Floods | 2.37 | 0.98 | 289 | -

Credit: FOTOGRIN - shutterstock.com A Chinese state-sponsored hacker group called RedNovember has conducted a global espionage campaign targeting critical infrastructure between June 2024 and July 2025, compromising defense contractors, government agencies, and major corporations while exploiting vulnerabilities faster than organizations could deploy security patches. The attacks included breaches of at least two US defense contractors and more than 30 Panamanian government agencies as part of a systematic targeting across the US, Europe, Asia, and South America, according to cybersecurity firm [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/rednovember-targets-government-defense-and-technology-organizations). The threat group deployed the Go-based Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike, and SparkRAT to maintain persistent network access after exploiting flaws in enterprise appliances, researchers said in the report. “The group has expanded its targeting remit across government and private sector organizations, including defense and aerospace organizations, space organizations, and law firms,” the report added. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group had previously tracked the activity under the designation TAG-100 before attributing it to Chinese state-sponsored operations. Microsoft also tracks overlapping activity from this group as Storm-2077. ## Systematic exploitation of enterprise network devices RedNovember systematically targeted internet-facing appliances that form the backbone of enterprise network security, successfully compromising SonicWall VPN devices, Ivanti Connect Secure appliances, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, F5 BIG-IP systems, Sophos SSL VPN products, and Fortinet FortiGate firewalls, researchers found. The hackers exploited both recently disclosed vulnerabilities and older flaws that organizations had failed to patch. RedNovember compromised two US defense contractors in April 2025 using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 vulnerabilities in Ivanti appliances – flaws for which patches had been available since January 2024, the report said. A European engine manufacturer that produces aerospace components was breached through its SonicWall VPN device, while multiple law firms fell victim through compromised network appliances, researchers documented. ## 72-hour vulnerability exploitation window RedNovember demonstrated the ability to weaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities faster than most organizations could deploy patches, researchers found. When researchers published proof-of-concept code for Check Point VPN vulnerability CVE-2024-24919 on [May 30, 2024](https://labs.watchtowr.com/check-point-wrong-check-point-cve-2024-24919/), RedNovember was attacking vulnerable systems by June 3. That campaign hit at least 60 organizations across Brazil, Germany, Japan, Portugal, the UK, and the United States within four days, according to the report. Similar patterns emerged with Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect devices, with RedNovember consistently exploiting disclosed vulnerabilities within 72 hours of public exploit code availability, the research showed. ## Open-source tools masked attribution Rather than developing custom malware, RedNovember relied heavily on publicly available tools, including the Pantegana backdoor, Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework, and SparkRAT remote access tool, all written in the Go programming language, researchers found. The hackers used variants of the LESLIELOADER tool to deploy SparkRAT on compromised systems, with samples first detected in March 2024, according to the analysis. RedNovember also leveraged legitimate services, including vulnerability scanning tools like PortSwigger’s Burp Suite and VPN services, including ExpressVPN and Cloudflare’s Warp, to manage their infrastructure. “RedNovember’s strategic use of open-source capabilities allows the threat group to lower operational costs and obfuscate attribution,” researchers explained in the report. ## Global targeting across multiple sectors The group heavily targeted organizations in the US, Taiwan, and South Korea, while also conducting surveillance of government agencies across Panama, and targeting entities in Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, the report said. The hackers maintained persistent access to compromised networks for months, with some intrusions lasting from July 2024 through March 2025, according to the research. A Taiwanese IT company remained compromised throughout this period, with researchers tracking communications to Pantegana command-and-control servers. The hacker group also targeted organizations handling sensitive business negotiations, successfully compromising an American law firm involved in debt restructuring for a Chinese company and attempting to breach a major US newspaper, the report found. ## Coordinated timing with geopolitical events Several RedNovember campaigns coincided with significant geopolitical developments, researchers observed. The systematic surveillance of more than 30 Panamanian government agencies occurred just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [announced](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/article/4150935/hegseth-says-us-partnering-with-panama-to-secure-canal-deter-china/) an expanded partnership to counter Chinese influence in the canal zone. The targeting of Taiwan facilities, which house both military installations and semiconductor research operations, coincided with Chinese military exercises involving 90 warships around the island in December 2024, the report noted. “The timing of the observed reconnaissance closely followed geopolitical and military events of key strategic interest to China,” the researchers wrote. The systematic targeting of internet-facing appliances across multiple vendor platforms indicated that organizations need enhanced monitoring and rapid patch deployment capabilities for network infrastructure devices, the report suggested. RedNovember “will almost certainly continue to target edge devices and exploit vulnerabilities soon after their release,” researchers added in the report.

The most notorious civil struggle has been the conflict with Kashmir insurgents, a border conflict between India and Pakistan that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. So it generally came as a surprise when the Indian Prime Minister Manmohn Singh declared the Maoist movement in the eastern part of the country to be the single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by India. The Indian Maoist movement can be traced back to the 1920s; however, the Naxalite group became a formal movement in 1967 after it became actively violent. The group was inspired by the agrarian revolution ideology as a means to achieve equality. The long-term goal of the organization is to capture political power by violently overthrowing the Indian state. Although the central government has boosted efforts in the fight against these extremists, the group has spread to involve about a third of India’s territory. The Naxalites are considered far-left radical communists and are declared a terrorist group under Indian law. In this report we will look into the Maoist movement in India, starting with its history. We will then explore how the movement has survived centralized efforts to eradicate it, paying special attention to the unique context of Indian society and politics. We will conclude by assessing the likelihood of the group’s success and the global geopolitical consequences. **[View the full report](https://www.confluenceinvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/weekly_geopolitical_report_10_28_2013.pdf)** _These reports were prepared by Confluence Investment Management LLC and reflect the current opinion of the authors.

The Naxal insurgency in India originated in a 1967 uprising in West Bengal by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most of the modern Maoist groups evolved from splinter groups of CPI- Marxist. Two of those splinter groups united in 2004 to form CPI-Maoist, the primary force in today’s conflict. CPI-Maoist and all other Naxal groups are designated as terrorist organizations. The conflict is concentrated the Eastern part of the country, particularly an area known as the Red Corridor. As of 2017, 104 districts in 13 states are affected by Naxal violence, down from a 2009 high of 195 districts in 16 states. Under India’s Constitution, maintenance of public order is the responsibility of States. The affected States have approached the insurgency with a mixture of policies including negotiation, development programs, and security programs. The Center government has also instituted programs to assist affected states, primarily through funding State programs.

The new priority is resilience — building networks that can adapt and endure,” Hamid Moghadam, co-founder and CEO of Prologis, said in a statement included in a company press release. ### Dive Insight: Economic volatility (51%), tariff increases and trade policy changes (48%), geopolitical instability and cybersecurity threats (38% each), and energy reliability and cost (33%) were the leading concerns cited by executives as potential 2026 operational disruptions, according to the survey. Additionally, the survey also highlighted AI adoption and the energy pressure it places on supply chains. AI requires large amounts of energy because training models involve “thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) running continuously for months, leading to [high electricity consumption](https://iee.psu.edu/news/blog/why-ai-uses-so-much-energy-and-what-we-can-do-about-it),” according to an April report from Penn State University’s Institute of Energy and the Environment. While data centers used 4.4% of U.S. electricity in 2023, that number could triple by 2028, according to Mahmut Kandemir, a professor of computer science and engineering at Penn State, the report’s author. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy [said power outages](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/lack-new-us-power-capacity-could-double-blackouts-by-2030-says-energy-department-2025-07-07/) could increase by 100 times by 2030 if suppliers don’t add capacity during peak demand periods. It also warned that AI demand from data centers is accelerating the strain. Prologis’ research also underscored businesses’ power vulnerabilities. Just 27% of organizations had what it called “advanced power resilience” capabilities, with just over half unprepared for extended power losses, the report found. “The disconnect between current capabilities and future demands creates a critical vulnerability that threatens operational continuity,” study authors wrote. The report also pointed to how companies are rethinking supply chain geography. After decades of optimizing for labor costs, 77% of executives said they were building regional, self-sufficient networks. Energy reliability stood out as the top determinant of where they locate facilities, ahead of tariffs and labor costs. Nearly eight in 10 leaders said they would consider relocating operations after experiencing as few as one to five major outages per year, a sign of how critical energy security has become. “Energy is the new fault line in global supply chains,” Susan Uthayakumar, chief energy and sustainability officer at Prologis, said in a statement included in a release on the report. “A majority of companies faced energy disruptions last year, and most expect their power needs to surge in the years ahead. The companies that solve for energy resilience will be the ones that stay ahead.” The report is based on a survey conducted for Prologis, a global logistics real estate firm, in August 2025, including input from 1,816 global executives. ### Recommended Reading - [Load growth, plant retirements could drive 100x increase in blackouts by 2030: DOE](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/load-growth-plant-retirements-blackouts-doe/752408/) By [Robert Walton](https://www.utilitydive.com/editors/robert/) • July 8, 2025 - [Fallout from shutdown could impact energy sector construction](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/government-shutdown-federal-construction-projects/761570/) By Sebastian Obando • Oct. 1, 2025 - [purchase licensing rights](https://www.utilitydive.com/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl=https://www.utilitydive.com/news/power-outages-drive-supply-chain-worries-report-says/801901/) Filed Under:[Grid Security & Reliability](https://www.utilitydive.com/topic/grid-security-reliability/) ### Utility Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Email: - Select Newsletter:Daily DiveM-F - Select Newsletter:Storage WeeklyEvery Tuesday - Select Newsletter:Load Management WeeklyEvery Wednesday - Select Newsletter:Renewable Energy WeeklyEvery Thursday - Select user consent:By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.informatechtarget.com/terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.informatechtarget.com/privacy-policy/).

[Sign up](https://subscribe.bylinetimes.com/newsletter-signup/) While the world focuses on the spectacle of India carrying out [its biggest national election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election) – with 960 million Indian citizens eligible to vote out of a population of 1.4 billion – serious unrest continues to haunt the state of Manipur. For the last five months, _Byline Times_ has continued to receive detailed weekly updates from frontline activists in the northeastern state. These catalogue ongoing communal violence between different ethnic and religious groups that is subverting social and political life in the remote region. Building on the conflict recounted in a [previous _Byline Times_ report](https://bylinetimes.com/2023/10/19/state-complicity-and-ethnic-cleansing-in-india/), this unrest has now been taking place for a year. The situation highlights a distinct disconnect between the apparent virtues of India as the world’s largest [democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) and the ongoing restriction of human rights in the country.

These non-Hindu tribal groups include the Kuki, Zomi, Mizo and Chin, which are more widely termed as the [Zo people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo_people). Activists maintain that, courtesy of their links to the ruling state [ministers](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/11/19/amid-the-media-noise-about-cronyism-keir-starmer-is-quietly-reforming-political-standards-for-the-better/) and sympathetic [police](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/11/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-child-abuse-allegations-made-by-victims-are-leading-to-charges/) groupings, the Meitei are being aided by official connivance in their carrying out of “ethnic pogroms”. Zo leaders note their [discrimination](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/09/police-race-action-plan-slammed/) by state officials and processes of “selective justice”, whereby Zo are presented as “anti-nationals” and are much more likely to be prosecuted.

Such accusations come in the midst of continuing violence perpetrated by Meitei tribals and [well-armed militias, such as the Arambai Tenggol](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/explained-who-are-meitei-radical-group-arambai-tenggol-and-why-did-they-summon-manipur-lawmakers) and [Meitei Leepun](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/manipur-violence-it-is-a-global-war-says-meitei-leepun-leader-pramot-singh-interview/article67004485.ece).

Villages have also faced attacks by [Meitei militias using automatic weapons and mortars](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/violence-continues-in-manipur-mortars-and-automatic-weapons-used/article67253119.ece). Often these incidents have been photographed and filmed, before being shared on social [media](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/10/21/telegraph-misled-readers-on-climate-change-impact-rules-press-watchdog-in-rare-slap-down/) platforms to incite violence and intimidate targeted tribals. This unrest has been intensive and systematic over the last 12 months and by October 2023 more than 70,000 people (including 12,000 children) had been displaced. It has been heightened by [periodic internet bans](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/manipur-violence-internet-services-restored-border-areas-exception-meiteis-kukis-2471548-2023-12-04) and the use of fake news by Meitei media groups, as well as utilising large [protest](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/12/when-peaceful-protesters-face-harsher-sentences-than-violent-racists-something-has-to-give/) mobs to demand the removal of non-Meitei public officials.

Related to these phenomena is the continued religious persecution of the Christian-majority Zo by the Hindu-majority Meitei, which has included [the burning of 357 churches](https://www.opendoors.org.au/frontline-faith/understanding-manipur-what-led-to-the-recent-violence-against-christians-in-india/) since May. Evidence has also surfaced of Zo graves being desecrated. Such claims come despite the existence of regional [Meitei drug gangs](https://thewire.in/security/manipur-violence-poppy-national-security-golden-triangle) and the increased interception by Indian security forces of armed Meitei militia members infiltrating India across the Myanmar border. This discrimination has raised fears that the communal violence aims to force non-Meitei tribals from their land, in order [to monopolise oil, gas and mineral reserves](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/at-the-core-of-manipurs-ethnic-strife-is-fight-over-tribal-land-rights) (such as uranium and platinum). The normalization of violence and population displacement accentuates such a threat. State complicity also plays a role, with Meitei leaders having linkages to big mining corporations eager to exploit such valuable natural commodities. In some areas, power supplies to non-Meitei villages have been sabotaged, leaving them without power or telecommunications for days. Elsewhere, non-Meitei villages have been blockaded by militias, preventing the delivery of essential food and commodities. Signalling a further escalation, in January 2024, [the central Manipur government conceded security control of Imphal to the Arambai Tenggol](https://thediplomat.com/2024/01/abject-surrender-of-the-state-to-armed-militia-in-indias-manipur/). This gave the Meitei militia dominance over security arrangements in Manipur’s capital and – given the militia’s ongoing violence – is an ugly portent for the local non-Meitei population. Meitei legislators were reportedly forced to declare allegiance to the Arambai Tenggol. In the months since the Arambai Tenggol took over, Imphal has seen a rise in armed intimidation, extortion, the illegal occupation of property, and even the [use of improvised explosive devices](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/one-dead-one-injured-blast-indias-manipur-state-2024-02-24/), or IEDs.

Other groups are also recasting the anniversary of the day that Manipur joined the Indian Union on 21 September 1949 as now being a “Black Day” of protest. Additional groups have protested calling for an end to gender-based violence and violence against students. Further collectives are demanding the setting up of an independent Zo administration in Manipur. Coupled with these movements are increasing calls for the Zo areas of Manipur to merge with those in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, especially given the ongoing displacement of the Zo. Within this context, the response by the central government in New Delhi continues to be seen as lax and insufficient. Although the troubles in Manipur are receiving greater national coverage, [Prime Minister Narendra Modi has resisted calls to visit the region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/indian-opposition-walks-out-as-narendra-modi-refuses-to-discuss-manipur-conflict). This comes despite the severe economic and social damage being wrought upon its people, as well as the slow Meitei domination of Manipur’s state bureaucracies. The 2024 [general election](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/08/28/stark-figures-reveal-how-many-londoners-were-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-in-general-election/) may be a factor here, with the BJP seeking to hold the [Inner Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency) (that includes the regional capital Imphal) and possibly gain the [Outer Manipur constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency), which it lost to the Naga People’s Front by 73,782 votes in 2019. Moreover, such a blind eye can also potentially be explained by the BJP’s deeper aim to actively assimilate all India’s minorities towards its Hindu majoritarian outlook. Escalating Meitei-instigated violence against Manipur’s tribal groups certainly – and usefully – fits with such a dynamic and appears to be increasingly successful. It also strengthens narratives of India’s Hindu population being threatened by non-Hindus. A BJP victory in the 2024 national [elections](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/) will only hasten such a forced “harmonisation”, with negative consequences for other non-Hindu groups, regions, and states across India. * * * ##### Written by [Chris Ogden](https://bylinetimes.com/author/chrisogden/) * * * ##### This article was filed under [Christianity](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/christianity/), [Democracy](https://bylinetimes.com/category/democracy/), [Hinduism](https://bylinetimes.com/category/religion/hinduism/), [India](https://bylinetimes.com/category/foreign-affairs/india-foreign-affairs/)",

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://https:%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ![down-arrow-image](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/FLRX/down-arrow-related-stories.svg) ## Stories that help you connect the dots [![](https://assetsfl.thehindu.com/theme/images/fl-online/1x1_spacer.png)](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

    "full_text": "# Thailand As Thailand’s knowledge and creative economies grow, it’s likely to find itself confronted with an increasing number of incidents of IP theft and cyberattacks. The Thai Government must focus more on proactive risk mitigation to protect its national proprietary assets and security. While Thailand has seen rapid development of its cybersecurity governance in the past few years, including with the establishment of a national cyber agency, little attention has been paid to cyber-related threats to innovation. ASPI assesses Thailand to be Moderately vulnerable to state-sponsored acts of cyber-enabled theft of IP. ### Author Dr. Jessada Burinsuchat [Wat Arun Ratchawararam 005](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/0000140_-_Wat_Arun_Ratchawararam_005.jpg) \\- [Preecha.MJ](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Preecha.MJ) ## Key Facts ### R&D Investments USD $5.8 billion (2019) ### Patent Applications 3,818 (2017) ### Cybersecurity Agency National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) How at risk is Thailand Thailand’s ambitious 20-year development strategy and “Thailand 4.0” vision, focusing on transforming key industries through science, technology, and innovation, place it at risk of cyber-enabled IP theft. The country’s growing digital economy, increasing foreign direct investment in ICT and manufacturing, and government incentives for R&D in strategic sectors make it an attractive target for state-sponsored actors seeking to steal valuable intellectual property and economic information. Since 2018, Thailand has actively pursued a 20-year development strategy to extend its knowledge economy. The strategy, which has been adopted into legislation, [focuses](http://nscr.nesdb.go.th/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/National-Strategy-Eng-Final-25-OCT-2019.pdf.) on developing various types of capital, including human, intellectual, financial, mechanised, social and natural resources. As part of the strategy, Thailand has also [unleashed](https://www.industry.go.th/web-upload/1xff0d34e409a13ef56eea54c52a291126/m_magazine/12668/373/file_download/b29e16008a87c72b354efebef853a428.pdf) a vision of ‘Thailand 4.0’ to transform Thailand into a value-based economy built on science, technology and innovation. Overall, Thailand’s knowledge sector is seeing modest signs of development. Thailand’s patent applications have hovered around 1,400 to 1,900 per year. Patent approval rates have remained low as Thailand faces issues with extensive backlogs and long delays in IP registration. In 2018, WIPO reported that Thailand’s success rate in granting patents was only 14%. Thailand’s foreign and economic policy is driven by pragmatism, as the government seeks to secure economic gains for national development. Thailand also maintains healthy economic and scientific ties with Japan and the US. Both were the biggest investors among OECD countries from 2020 to 2022. Thailand also maintains strong economic ties with China. A part of the relationship focuses on technology investments and technology transfers from China to Thailand. The economic relationship has included strong collaboration in science and technology, and Chinese firms have invested in Thailand’s 5G infrastructure and the broader connectivity ecosystem, including railways. While the two states maintain a bilateral IP agreement, the focus of the agreement is on capacity building. For instance, China has helped to cultivate engineering talent for high-speed railways in Thailand. Overall, Thailand’s relationship with China is quite comprehensive, touching on economics, technology transfers and scientific cooperation. How prepared is Thailand Thailand maintains modest defences to combat the threat of cyber-enabled IP theft. Broadly, cybersecurity in Thailand has struggled to keep pace with economic development and the digital transformation. While there’s better awareness in cyber-dependent sectors, the overall population lacks digital literacy and cybersecurity knowledge, leading to a very high number of cybercrime victims. The banking sector, in particular, has established cybersecurity measures, and government and businesses have invested more in awareness building. The National Cyber Security Agency (established in 2011), Office of the Personal Data Protection Committee, and the Royal Thai Police play significant roles in regulating and enforcing cybersecurity and combating cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. The country participates in international agreements and norms related to cybersecurity, seeking bilateral cooperation while balancing relationships with major powers and multilateral cooperation. Thailand hasn’t ratified the Budapest Convention, but it complies with its principles through the Computer Crime Act. Thailand is currently playing an active role in the UN’s Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of ICTs for Criminal Purposes. Overall, Thailand’s posture on international norms on state behaviour in cyberspace has been reactive, though it does comply with most international standards. Thailand has been working to improve IP protection and enforcement to address IP theft. IP governance has almost all the necessary policy frameworks and organisational structures in place. A subcommittee on IP rights enforcement was set up in 2016 to bring 16 government agencies as well as industry groups together to promote IP protection and counter IP violations. In 2017, the Department of Intellectual Property formed a multiagency centre, called Intellectual Property Enforcement, which includes 39 agencies, such as the Internal Security Operations Command, the Royal Thai Police and other public and private agencies to crack down on markets that violate IP laws. Amendments to the Computer Crime Act 2007 in 2017 and additional measures in the Copyright Act now enable internet service providers and commercial service platforms to take down infringing content. There’s a growing culture of IP protection in Thailand, and the country moved up in the US’s Special 301 Report from the Priority Watch List to the Watch List tier in 2017. Efficiency in implementation and enforcement is the biggest stumbling block, in large part due to bureaucratic mechanisms. Altogether, the country’s participation in international IP agreements reflects its commitment to IP protection, but it’s considered a follower rather than a leading actor in the international IP protection agenda. # **Reported cases of economic cyber-espionage** ### Name of Incident ### Victims (entities) ### Sectors Affected ### Affected economies ### Threat Actor ### Alleged state sponsor ### Date reported Operation Cloud Hopper (APT10) Customers or providers of Managed Services / Enterprise Service / Cloud Services, manufacturing companies in India, Japan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service providers worldwide. Computer System Design and Related Services, Telecommunications, Mining Australia, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, UK APT10 China 2017 ### Context Operation Cloud Hopper is one of the largest sustained global cyber espionage campaigns. The operation has been traced back to at least 2016 and has targeted managed IT service providers, thus acquiring potentially unprecedented access to IP and sensitive data of those MSPs as well as their clients across the globe. Some of these targets compromised include Fujitsu, Tata Consultancy Services, NTT Data, Dimension Data, Computer Sciences Corporation, DXC Technology, Ericsson, and IBM (see Operation Cloud Hopper). A wide range of sectors were affected, ranging from telecommunications to mining. The suspected targets of these operations were those that aligned with China’s national security and “Made in China” goals, focused primarily on valuable military and intelligence information as well as confidential business data. PwC, in cooperation with BAE Systems and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, attributed the attacks to APT10, a China-based hacking group. Symantec, similarly, found an advanced persistent threat campaign targeting companies in multiple sectors across 17 regions in Japan. This campaign was also attributed to Cloud Hopper (which they called Cicada).Several countries, including the US and Australia, attributed Operation Cloud Hopper to a hacking group that has backing from the Chinese state. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Intellectual property, possibly worth billons of dollars ### Attribution [PwC](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html), [Symantec](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage), Governments of US, UK, New Zealand, and Australia ### Governments' response The U.S. Government held the Chinese government accountable for these campaigns, including [indicting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion) suspected hackers.

Emissary Panda may also be connected to several other PRC-sponsored APTs, including Emmisary Panda, APT27, and Luckymouse 2018 ### Context Dubbed “Operation Pzchao” by Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, this cyber campaign targeted government institutions, as well as private firms in the technology, education, and telecommunications sector that are primarily based in the U.S., though with also some cases in several other countries. Bitdefender attributed the attack to Emmisary Panda, a China-based threat group active since 2010. The group has been suspected of conducting [espionage](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/mustang-panda) operations on civil society organisations and governments deemed critical of the PRC, including advocacy organisations on Taiwan and Tibetan independence. While this threat group’s focus has traditionally been on political espionage, we suspect – with moderate confidence¬ – that this attack had possible economic objectives as well. Initiated in July 2017, this cyber incident came against the backdrop of developments in China’s technology and telecommunications sector, including Beijing [laying out](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/china-artificial-intelligence.html) a development plan to become the world leader in AI by 2030. The Iron Tiger APT (aka Panda Emissary or TG-3390) is active at least since 2010 and targeted organization in APAC, but since 2013 it is attacking high-technology targets in the US. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Unknown ### Attribution [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/185/Bitdefender-Business-2017-WhitePaper-PZCHAO-crea2452-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf) ### Governments' response None ### Sources ### Level of confidence **Moderate Confidence** **(7 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - No clear information if commercial data is targeted (1 point) - APT actor has some history of stealing IP and other commercially valuable data (2 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, USA and Vietnam Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) 2017 ### Context In 2017, FireEye announced that they have observed APT32 conducting cyberespionage operations targeting foreign companies with a vested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors.

These campaigns were conducted in three clusters. First, from January to March 2020, there was a broad campaign against 75 private entities in 20 countries, with a focus on industries ranging from petrochemicals to defense industrial base. Mandiant notes that while it’s unclear if APT41 scanned the Internet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, the victims appear to be more targeted in nature. The economies affected were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA.

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about. However, the announcement came just hours after cross-border attacks had sharply escalated, with India reportedly striking several Pakistani airbases, including one near Islamabad, to which Pakistan responded by reportedly hitting two...",

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government’s announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ ### [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture. ### Gift this article to a friend Your membership includes the ability to share articles with friends.

Four of the sites were reportedly located in Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, with the remaining five located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Local media reports claim India's military used air assets to deploy standoff weapons, including SCALP/Storm Shadow cruise missiles and AASM HAMMER smart missiles, as well as loitering munitions to target alleged militant infrastructure. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri characterized the strikes as \"pre-emptive and precautionary,\" saying New Delhi acted in response to intelligence it had...",

On May 10, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after a series of retaliatory strikes and cross-border clashes triggered by a deadly militant attack on April 22 in India-administered Kashmir, which New Delhi claims was carried out by an alleged Pakistan-backed militant group. Following the ceasefire, India and Pakistan's military leaders held a phone call on May 12 to discuss de-escalation. Later, on May 30, a senior Pakistani military official stated that the two countries were close to reaching an agreement to reduce troop deployments along the border to pre-conflict levels, though no such drawdown has yet been observed....",

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) China’s recent reassertion of its 1959 border line with India has left little room for a compromise in the two countries’ territorial dispute in Ladakh ahead of the approaching harsh winter, which will enable Beijing to both reinforce its claims in the Himalayan region come spring, as well as test Indian resolve with actions at other areas along the border. In late September, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a statement to the Hindustan Times confirming it still recognizes its unilateral 1959 line along the Indian border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which was drawn before the two countries’ war in 1962. Military officials from the two sides are set to meet Oct. 12 for the seventh round of Corps Commander talks aimed at resolving the border standoff in the eastern section of Ladakh, but China’s reassertion of the 1959 line makes any resolution difficult before the winter season sets in...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how. The diplomatic path forward for future rounds of international negotiations is also unclear, with the United States wanting to enforce current U.N. agreements as Russia proposes more. Thus, despite the progress seen so far this year, the...

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Since US President Donald Trump’s imposition of a 50% tariff rate on India (25% reciprocal tariff plus a 25% Russia penalty), the standoff between India and the Unites States has continued. In this article, we look at possible scenarios and medium-term implications in light of these tariffs being implemented. India has maintained a defiant stance on protecting farmers’ interests. Multiple outcomes are possible from here, with different implications. On trade, the US and India have held five rounds of negotiations, where India offered zero tariffs on industrial goods, and agreed to gradually reduce tariffs on US cars, but disagreements emerged over India’s reluctance to open its agriculture (genetically modified crops) and dairy sectors, which are politically important for President Trump. A fundamental misalignment also emerged between the two nations' approaches: India sought a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, while it appears the Trump administration preferred a quick deal. India's response has been notably resolute across multiple fronts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized unwavering protection of farmers' interests, even at personal cost, and has encouraged citizens to buy goods domestically. Within India, both opposition leaders and business community representatives have rallied behind the government's position, accepting short-term economic pain over perceived international pressure. In our base case, we assume the 25% reciprocal tariff remains in place through FY26, but the 25% Russian penalty is effective only until November. As such, we expect GDP growth at 6.6% y-o-y in FY26, after considering other policy offsets. On the other hand, if both sides dig in their heels, resulting in a continuation of the 50% tariff rate, then we would expect the hit to GDP growth to be 0.8 percentage points on an annualized rate basis. The current account deficit is also likely to deteriorate to around 1.1% of GDP. We see significant spillovers hitting investment and consumption through job losses in export intensive sectors, with further escalation risks through tariffs or non-tariff barriers. With the new tariff structure, the cost differential between India and China has narrowed, and between India and Southeast Asian competitors, it has moved in favor of the latter. This could have various effects on the shape of new supply chains such as the negative impact on textiles, leather and toys, and Indian firms possibly relocating their production to lower tariff countries to retain their US customer base. However, this will merely disrupt global value chain integration for India, not derail it entirely. We expect the government to announce a multi-pronged response, with fiscal and financial support for exporters, focus on export diversification and fast-tracking free trade agreements. More reforms are also likely. Goods and services tax rationalization has already been announced, and we expect further reforms such as FDI liberalization, deregulation, factor market reforms, privatization, and administrative reforms.

(PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP via Getty Images) While most of Brazil's main exports to the United States are exempt from Trump's newly announced 40% tariff, the additional levies -- along with Brazil's impending economic retaliation and the likely arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro -- will further strain bilateral ties. On July 30, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order adding 40% tariffs on Brazil, which are set to take effect on Aug. 6, on top of the current 10% the country currently faces. This is in line with Trump's earlier threats to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he justified by citing, among other things, an alleged political persecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and several court rulings against U.S. tech companies. Since Trump made that threat on July 9, the two countries have not engaged in any formal negotiations on the tariffs, with the highest-level engagements being phone calls between Brazilian Industry... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

Trump’s decision to go ahead with reciprocal tariffs stems from the perceived injury inflicted by China running a surplus of 295.4 billion dollars in 2024, a direct result of exporting 15 per cent of its total exports to the US. While the US’ exports to China comprise low-value-added farm goods such as soybeans, cotton, beef, and poultry, its imports from China range from home appliances, toys, electronics, machinery, to processed minerals, including expensive rare earth ores that are the mainstay of its mighty military-industrial complex in recent years. It is a paradox, nay, a parody, that the US, the bastion of free and open trade, now presides over the extirpation of an edifice of its own making. It is another story that [globalisation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/economic-perspectives-c-p-chandrasekhar-globalisation-neoliberalism-begins-to-unravel-slowly-but-surely/article67460638.ece) had its cruellest fallout in terms of widening inequality and a race to the bottom in the exploitation of the earth’s minerals and resources by a few to the detriment of many. The process of deglobalisation was set in motion over the last few years when many countries resorted to protectionist policies in the garb of making their country great again. After all, Trump did express his displeasure during his first term by jettisoning the Paris Agreement of 2015 since it went against his penchant for the fossil fuel industry run by his billionaire cronies in the US. With no guardrails in place, such reckless policymaking was bound to result in unsavoury consequences—and it did, with alarming speed. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** While Trump’s battle to settle scores involves as many as 75 countries across the world that enjoy trade surplus with the US, the sole purpose was to isolate China as the main villain. Trump did not mind antagonising long-standing allies in Europe, South-east Asia and Japan, not to speak of emerging economies including India in the process. However, the US-China trade fight hit a fever pitch when Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on all other trade partners, leaving China to face total levies as high as 145 per cent in retribution for its retaliatory tariff hike against Trump’s April 2 tariff blitzkrieg. Beijing returned the salvo, increasing its tariff to 125 per cent on imports from the US. Interestingly, this tit-for-tat is being played by the two trade majors when most nations still believe in the benefits of trade with China, which has emerged as the top trading partner in a few regions over the last decade. This was no doubt catalysed by several initiatives from Beijing, including the Belt and Road Initiative and its lending spree to development projects in Africa and Latin America, thus ensuring new friends at a time when the traditional Bretton Woods lending agencies were faced with dwindling funding from Western donors in general, and the US, in particular. ### New alliance partners Against this unfolding drama, attempts are afoot to forge new alliances outside the US and even expand the extant coalition of interested parties among all the trading nations. The statement of Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan that “the recent developments have convinced us we need to accelerate this process of making common cause for multilateralism, economic integration, free flow of trade and investments and technology with as wide a group as possible” is not a voice in the void, as many a nation is increasingly coming to this lacerating reality, buffeted by the slew of surging tariffs. As Southeast Asian nations remain hardest hit by the whopping tariffs, the European Union (EU) is now ready to reach out to the countries of the region for the first time. The EU already has the world’s largest network of trade pacts with 74 countries, with some 44 per cent of its trade covered by preferential arrangements. Trade policy analysts contend that more nations joining the EU bloc is aimed at the diversification of regional trade between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. This is also crucial for South Asian and Latin American exports that face high tariffs, largely due to their low and slow pace of trade agreements, exports of natural resources, and integration into global supply chains. India’s bid to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU, which has been dragging on for more than a decade, is a case in point. Recently, the UN Conference on Trade & Development pointed out how East Asian exporters now face fewer trade barriers globally as their exports are locked in industries with lower tariff rates, even as their trade competitiveness is driven by efficiency, production networks, and technological capabilities rather than high preferential margins. The time has come for New Delhi to hasten trade deals and forge alliances at a faster clip with China, Russia, the EU, the UK, and Canada. Regrettably, India missed being part of the 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which includes the ASEAN member states along with China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea) which would have given it a firm footing in the Asia-Pacific. For India, the road ahead is between a rock and a hard place, as it has neglected building its manufacturing capabilities with quality and price competitiveness for decades. No wonder its recent bid to become a robust force through production-linked incentives in select high-tech and traditional industries cost it dearly, with heavy dependence on imports from China spiralling its import bill and evoking serious concerns over its sustainability. India’s trade deficit with China was nearly $100 billion in 2024. China has become India’s foremost trading partner, overtaking the US. China is meanwhile digging in for the long haul in facing the tariff challenge thrown by the US, with adequate ammunition in the form of reciprocal tariffs on services trade, as the US accounts for 9.5 per cent of China’s service trade deficit of $26 billion in 2023. A paper in the China Academy proclaimed that if other nations extend Trump’s reciprocal tariff logic to service trade, China, the EU, and Saudi Arabia should levy a tariff of 28 per cent, 15 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively, on the US service sector. The possibility that China might leverage its US dollar reserves and Treasury holdings—as it reportedly did during the bond sale debacle—has also prompted Trump to halt the tariff hike temporarily. These two “trump cards” that China could use to escalate the fight into US-dreaded territories are what makes the threat from Trump an unlikely bazooka. **Also Read \\| [India was still dealt a blow: Michael Kugelman](https://frontline.thehindu.com/interviews/trump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact/article69433903.ece)** For India, the next month, Bilateral Trade Agreement meeting holds the contours for the shape of things to come. To fend off yielding to the US’ preference to prise open India’s farm and automobile sector, including the entry of the glitzy Harley-Davidson bikes, and the brews and beverages segment in the face of a 26 per cent duty on all exports to the US if the negotiations result in an impasse, calls for adroit negotiating skills. What is at stake is not markets on both sides but the promise to take the bilateral trade volume fourfold to $500 billion by 2030, as agreed by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington early this year. Mere declaration of a National Manufacturing Mission without laying the legwork in the realms of land and labour reforms may not cut any ice, as this involves cross-cutting interests and cooperative States to get investors on board. Even then, with a demographic dividend to boot, the time is ripe for India to ramp up low-value manufacturing with locally sourced inputs instead of investing heavily in semiconductors, which involves the import of inputs which get erratic in an uncertain world. _G.

As of June 4, early results from India's general election indicate that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government are poised to secure a historic third consecutive term in office, but will fall short of a majority needed to form a government, thus forcing it to rely on its coalition partners within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to remain in power. But the NDA has already reached the 272-seat threshold needed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of India's Parliament, thereby clinching Modi and his party's reelection....",

Until New Delhi addresses the underlying grievances spurring unrest in Kashmir Valley, its residents will continue to oppose Indian rule. (TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP/Getty Images) Kashmir is known throughout South Asia for its natural beauty, which draws visitors from far and wide. But beneath the region's alluring exterior, deep-seated grievances are beginning to jeopardize its stability. On July 8, Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, the 22-year-old commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant separatist group that calls for the India-administered portion of the region (Jammu and Kashmir) to join Pakistan. The organization's fighters regularly sustain casualties, but Wani's death set off widespread protests in the state's capital, Srinagar. In an effort to contain the situation, New Delhi temporarily shuttered at least four major Kashmiri newspapers, cut off mobile phone and internet access to the region, and imposed a curfew that has yet to be lifted. These measures have not stopped the demonstrations, however, and clashes between protesters and security forces have left more than 50 dead and 3,000 injured. New Delhi has pointed the finger at...

Organizations like the VHP are on the upswing as Hindu nationalism grows in India. (NASIR KACHROO/NurPhoto via Getty Images) With more than a billion people, India is a kaleidoscope of different languages, castes, regions and religions; indeed, the demographic diversity has long led the country's leaders to pursue secularist policies, lest support for any one group incite communal clashes. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, the government is pursuing greater national unity through social policies that give more pride of place to the nearly 80 percent of the country that is Hindu. Ahead of elections in 2019, Modi frequently played the populist card in an effort to curry favor with Hindu nationalists. Now, as Modi embarks on another five years in office, such populist policies -- like the revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy, the implementation of a divisive citizenship bill that allegedly discriminates against Muslims and the allocation of the disputed site of a demolished mosque for a Hindu temple -- are likely to...

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

The outcome could set a precedent for renewable energy developers facing transmission bottlenecks, as India accelerates its clean energy rollout. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fsustainability%2Fboards-policy-regulation%2Findian-power-regulator-takes-up-solar-firms-plea-losses-due-transmission-delays-2025-10-06%2F) In the filing posted over the weekend, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is examining whether the Power Grid Corporation of India [(PGRD.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/PGRD.NS) and the Central Transmission Utility of India, the institutions responsible for setting up transmission infrastructure, should compensate developers for losses. CERC has asked both to respond within six weeks. The developers, ACME Solar [(ACMO.NS), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ACMO.NS) and AMPIN Energy, argued in separate petitions that they suffered financial losses due to their inability to transmit power from their solar projects due to delays in operationalising transmission infrastructure. The Gurugram-based ACME Solar is seeking more than 210 million rupees in compensation, while AMPIN Energy did not specify its losses. CERC has directed the Central Transmission Utility and Power Grid to submit details on the transmission system, commissioning timelines, and reasons for the delays. The petitions are scheduled to be heard on November 27. Power Grid and the Central Transmission Utility did not immediately respond to Reuters' email seeking comments. India has been forced to [curb](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/india-curbs-solar-power-output-keep-grid-stable-amid-low-demand-ministry-says-2025-08-19/) solar output during periods of low demand to maintain grid stability and ease congestion, as renewable energy supply rises and transmission projects lag. Rajasthan, India’s top green power-producing state, has seen nearly 4 gigawatts of clean energy curtailed, with estimated losses of up to 2.5 billion rupees ($28.16 million), according to the Rajasthan Solar Association.

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

    "full_text": "Cyberattacks on water utilities in highly water-stressed areas threaten to disrupt agriculture and industrial processes, exacerbate social unrest and cause civilian casualties, especially in periods of high tension or outright conflict. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, particularly in geographic regions with high water stress, scrutiny of cyber threat actors' potential disruption of water flows is rising. Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

This issue is particularly keen in South Asia, with the World Resources Institute categorizing 74% of the region as exposed to \"extremely high water stress,\" which the institute defines as countries regularly using up almost their entire available water supply.

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "title": "India’s trade faces tariff shock | State Street",
    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "Under the new Trump administration, the US imposed tariffs of 10% to 50% on imports from over 80 countries. India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B) 1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems &amp; jewelry, dairy &amp; agriculture, machinery &amp; engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems &amp; jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42% 2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18% 3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion 4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21% 5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP 6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

On April 2, the United States announced a new set of tariffs impacting many trading partners, including a 37% tariff on Bangladesh, 30% on Pakistan and 44% on Sri Lanka. While the United States suspended these so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain subject to the blanket 10% tariff that the United States imposed on most of its trading partners. These tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address trade imbalances.

On May 26-27, Malaysia, as the 2025 ASEAN chair, hosted a series of summits that underscored ASEAN's broad dual-track initiatives to bolster intra-bloc trade and trade diversification. The 46th ASEAN Summit, convened on May 26, brought together leaders from the ten-member bloc and produced a new five-year strategic plan aimed at deepening economic integration among member states, with goals such as further harmonizing trade standards, enhancing financial integration and promoting sustainable economic practices.
