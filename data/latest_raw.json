[Articles](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/recent) **Red Salute: India’s Maoist Maelstrom and Evolving Counterinsurgency Doctrines** Sajid Farid Shapoo > “ _One Mahsud tribesman aptly described to me their tactics as being like that of the hawk. The hawk flies high in the sky, out of danger; he flies round and round until he sees his prey and then he swoops down on it for one mighty strike and when he has got his prey, he does not wait around, he flies off at once to some far off quiet place where he can enjoy what he has got_ [\\[i\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn1).” It was a usual summer afternoon in the dense tropical forests of Jheeram Ghati (valley) of Darbha Division in Chhattisgarh; hot and humid with thick canopy of trees blocking the sunlight, making it appear already like dusk\\*. Kiran, along with his other comrades had been sitting on an ambush site for the last seven days. Just a day ago they had received information about some senior members of Indian National Congress, a prominent political party, who would be travelling through Darbha, on their way back from electioneering. The Maoists usually avoid targeting political leaders unless directed by top leadership, the Central Committee. But one name would drive Kiran and his comrades to take matters in their own hand and launch an attack. The name was Mahendra Karma, a former minister in Chhattisgarh Government and the founder of Salwa Judum. Salwa Judum was a pro state, tribal auxiliary defense militia, which few years ago, had become an important part of state’s COIN strategy and tactics. Salwa Judum meaning ‘Purification hunt’ was raised by Mahendra Karma in 2005 by drawing in local tribal youths and surrendered Maoists. Their arrival on the COIN scenario was seen by many as a game changer and the tide had started to turn against the Maoist. There were however large scale accusations of murders, rapes and extortion of local tribals by the Salwa Judum members [\\[ii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn2). A view upheld by Supreme Court of India, when it banned the Salwa Judum in 2011. [\\[iii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn3) Though the ambush as a part of annual ‘Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign’ of Communist Party of India (Maoist) was originally planned to attack the security forces, the opportunity to target Mahendra Karma, was enough for Maoists to quickly recalibrate their strategy [\\[iv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn4). On May 25th 2013, Kiran and his comrades attacked the convoy killing around 28 people including Mahendra Karma. To the surprise of Maoists there were other senior party leaders also in the convoy, including Nand Kumar Patel, former Home Minister of Chhattisgarh and Vidya Charan Shukla former union minister, all of whom were killed in the attack. The attack was perhaps the single most devastating strike that Maoists had carried out against political leaders, killing almost the entire top brass of Congress leadership in Chhattisgarh [\\[v\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn5). The attack was carried by skillful use of guerrilla tactic, first by initiating IED blasts to blow the front vehicles. Once the convoy was immobilized, the insurgents swooped down from the nearby hills firing at the convoy. None amongst the two dozen security personnel accompanying the convoy could react or was given a chance to react [\\[vi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn6). The Darbha attack, as it was revealed later, was not a pre planned attack on the political leadership. The opportunity to strike at Mahendra Karma, led to a quick yet successful recalibration of the strategy. The attack was planned and executed by the local Darbha Division of the CPI (Maoist). There were around 40 to 50 insurgents aided by around 100 men and women belonging to local tribal militia [\\[vii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn7). After the attack the insurgents like true guerrilla hawks quickly retreated back into the jungles and left the area. The members of the militia went back to their daily routine. The attack again reinforced certain key strengths of the insurgents which include i) robust and efficient intelligence network ii) devolution of authority to the local committees iii) ability to quickly readjust their strategy iv) extensive support from local tribes and ability to organize them into tribal militia for short term tactical purposes and v) domination of local landscape. The Darbha attack was an appropriate reminder of why the Maoist insurgency has repeatedly been called India’s biggest internal security challenge [\\[viii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn8). This paper is an attempt to understand this very challenge. The paper intends to trace back the origins of Maoist movements in India which would help in putting the current stream of insurgency in perspective. This is followed by understanding the current insurgency with its strategy and tactics. Besides delving deep into the COIN strategies adopted by Indian security forces and the raging debates about it, I have also made an attempt to analyze a success model in the form of Andhra Pradesh’s COIN campaign. I have concluded with a brief analysis of the problem. **Guerrilla on the Scene: History of Maoism in India** The early Maoist hawks emerged around the same time when Mehsud tribes were hunting their prey in Kashmir. The initial Maoist strands can be traced back to a peasant rebellion in Telegana in the erstwhile Nizam state of Hyderabad in 1947.In April 1948, a dissident faction of the Communist Party of India (CPI) was responsible for organizing the peasants in the Telangana region and adopted Maoism as both its goal and strategy [\\[ix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn9). The Telangana movement was a result of acute agrarian stress caused by exploitation of poor peasants and tribals by the landlords (Jagirdars and deshmukhs). The peasants and tribals were perpetually in debt and many committed suicides when the harassment of Jagirdars and Deshmuks became intolerable [\\[x\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn10). This movement laid down the framework of principals and strategies which the future communist insurgencies would also adopt. The CPI, in 1950, laid down the principles insurgency in India which I will discuss later in the paper. Suffice to say that Indian communists very early in their struggle had adopted the Mao’s idealogy of ‘People’s War’ as their mode of struggle. There was widespread violence both by the rebels and the state. The movement resulted in deaths of thousands of tribals and peasants. This movement ended in early fifties partly as a result of strong government action and also the decision of CPI to take part in the first electoral process of the independent India [\\[xi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn11). **_Naxalbari Rebellion_** In 1967, Communist Party of India (Maoist Leninst) headed by Charu Majumdar, took the cause of agricultural laborers and sharecroppers against the repressive policies of ‘Jotedars’ (nonagricultural landlords) and started an armed insurgency in Naxalbari district of West Bengal. The widespread ideological appeal of the Naxalbari movement, is the reason, why the name ‘Naxal’ has survived till today and is commonly used in addressing the Maoist insurgents. The exploitative policies of these ‘Jotedars’ had resulted in chronic indebtedness of the share croppers and agricultural laborers. The insurgency with its growing ideological appeal soon spread to other areas including Calcutta (Kolkata) where the university students took the cause of these laborers and started an urban armed insurgency against the state government. The Naxalite movement began to spread both vertically amongst sections of students/educated middle class and horizontally across other states. There were insurgent leaders who aspired to create liberated zones and what they called ‘turning India into little Vietnams’ [\\[xii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn12).The aim was to start a prairie fire as envisaged by Mao, which would spread to entire India setting it ablaze with revolutionary war. The success of movement seemed imminent to the communists as one Chinese Newspaper reported in July 1967 “Although the course of the Indian revolutionary struggle will be long and tortuous, the Indian revolution guided by great Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong’s Thought, will surely triumph” [\\[xiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn13). How ever the aim and aspirations fell flat as insurgents failed to create a mass support for the movement. The leaders of the movement had assessed that the insurgency, in Mao’s words, would act as a spark which would set the entire prairie in flames [\\[xiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn14). The leaders of the movement failed to appreciate that the success of Mao’s movement was predicated on the support of the population. The government responded with heavy use of force. Leaders of the movement were arrested. The tactics adopted by rebels were anything but guerrilla. These minimally trained revolutionaries were no match to the government forces [\\[xv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn15). The movement was slowly marginalized and was all but crushed in 1972 by a concerted COIN campaign by West Bengal police with the help of central government. The fire had been doused but embers remained. These embers in the form of Charu’s supporters travelled to other parts of country in a bid to ignite the next prairie fire. **_Spreading Prairie Fire: Buildup to the Next Phase_** The Naxalbari movement was to inspire future generations of Indian left wing extremist. The ideology of ‘People’s war’ spread to other states. Though the Naxalbari uprising was a localized affair but it “marked an advance for the people of India as the Paris Commune had marked an advance for the world proletariat [\\[xvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn16).” Some of the comrades of Charu Mazumdar took the revolutionary ideas of Naxalbari movement with them to Telangana region in Andhra Pradesh and started mobilizing the masses for an impending struggle. These comrades realized the importance of mass mobilization, which the Naxalbari leaders had neglected. They formed a ‘Central Organizing Group’ (COG) for this purpose. Telangana had a history of left inspired struggles which started with Telangana movement of 1948. There was another communist backed peasant uprising in Srikakulam district in 1960s. In 1980 Kondapalli Seetharamaih broke away from COG and formed CPI (ML) People’s War Group (PWG). He started amass mobilization campaign which included setting up of ‘Forest Committees’ which would mobilize tribals in the jungle areas and ‘Regional Committees’ for the plains areas. By mid eighties the PWG cadres indulged in large scale violence and started targeting the government machinery. The state responded with escalating its counterinsurgency operations. The state government banned PWG in 1992. In two years more than 350 insurgents were killed and around 3000 members and sympathizers were arrested. PWG was also marred by internal strife and there was a split in the party with Kondapally Seetharamaiah being replaced by Mupalla Laxmana Rao alias Ganapathy, as general secretary. How ever the low period of the movement was not to remain for long, it would make a comeback few years later and this time more sinister than ever. Apart from Telengana , the Naxalite movement post Naxalbari had spread to other states mainly Bihar and Chattisgarh. In the state of Bihar, Maoist Coordination Committee (MCC) was the most prominent naxal group. The unique feature of naxal violence was attacks on the caste lines. Between 1987 and 1992, MCC killed more than 300 people belonging to upper castes [\\[xvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn17). MCC tried to project this caste based violence as class conflicts. It is true that in a highly stratified caste based society of Bihar, the caste invariably reflects the class but not always. What began as a fight for socioeconomic justice, degenerated into inter-caste clashes in Bihar. **_Present Phase: The Big Challenge_** During the decade of 80s and 90s, left extremist parties always tried to keep their armed component subordinate to the political wing. This had resulted in poor mobilization of armed insurgents. Rampant factionalism within the Maoists in the 90s also impacted their capability. The ‘people’s war’ could be fought only with a properly equipped People’s Liberation Army. The PWG realized this shortcoming and started laying emphasis on militarization of its armed component. The first step towards adoption of Mao’s strategy was taken by PWG in 2000 when they decided to set up a People’s Guerrilla Army. The aim was “to strengthen the political power of the people and to defeat the efforts of the State and the Central Governments to check the revolutionary movement [\\[xviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn18).” In 2004 the insurgents took a monumental decision which changed the course of Maoist insurgency in India and transformed it into India’s biggest internal security challenge. The PWG and MCC merged and formed CPI (Maoist) with Muppala Lakshman Rao alias Ganapathy as its General secretary. A year before the official announcement of the merger, the Maoists had started coming together and launching attacks on the police and security forces. The convergence of resources and efforts on one hand boosted party’s ability to mobilize the masses and on the other, it enhanced the striking capability of its armed wing. The result was quantitatively massive upsurge in the Maoist violence. In the last 12 years more than 2000 security force members have been killed [\\[xix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn19). In the year of their merger, Maoist launched one of their most daring attacks in Koraput district of Orissa. A group of 300 Maoist staged a meticulous attack on several government establishments including police stations, the district jail and the office of the Superintendent of Police. The insurgents killed about 30 people and decamped with a huge cache of arms and ammunitions. Some 1100 weapons were looted from the police armory which included AK-47s and Self Loading Rifles thus translating Mao’s idea of “state’s armory is our armory [\\[xx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn20).” The Maoist influence has gradually extended over large parts of the country. Addressing the police chiefs of the country on 15 September 2009, the Indian home minister stated that ‘Maoist ideology had its pockets of influence in 20 states across the country, and that over 2,000 police station areas in 223 districts in these states were partially or substantially affected by the menace’ [\\[xxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn21). **Biggest Internal Security Challenge: Various Dimensions** Maoist violence has spread to more than one third of the country. Government data reveals that a total of 802 members of security forces have been killed in various insurgent related incidents in last five years where as the number of insurgents killed by security forces in the same period stands at 494 [\\[xxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn22). This shows a better kill ratio in favor of insurgents. The number of civilian casualties were 2162 between 2010 and 2015. There were more than 6500 Maoist related incidents in the same period [\\[xxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn23). These are huge numbers. Adding to these grim statistics are the worrying trends of spread of the movement. Maoist activities were witnessed in 203 Districts of 20 States in 2011, the latest government figures of 2015 show Maoist incidents in more than dozen states, which does give the impression that a third of the country’s area is under some sort of Maoist influence. Apart from their traditional strongholds in Central India, Maoists are seriously involved in mobilization activities in parts of Assam, Punjab and the southern states. Maoist violence over the last decade has witnessed increased sophistication both in strategy and tactics. They have been able to upgrade their arsenal both quality and numbers. Their arms match those of counter insurgents, in fact are similar as majority of these have been looted from the state armories. One dictum of Mao, which his revolutionary followers in India have operationally translated with increasing success is that “state’s armory is our armory”. The attacks as a result have become sinister, well organized and large scale. The targets are not any more the individual class enemies, it is the state itself. The security forces have suffered heavy casualties both in numbers and looting of arms. The insurgency with its vertical and horizontal proliferation is proving to be India’s biggest internal security challenge. **Evolution of Maoist Strategy and Tactics** Very early in their evolution, the Indian communist parties recognized the appeal and applicability of Maoist doctrine to Indian settings. Mao’s ‘Protracted People War’ carried more currency than the Lenin’s urban class revolution. The present Maoist strategy is based on the doctrinal document, it released in 2004 after the creation of CPI (Maoist). The document named, _Strategy & Tactics of The Indian Revolution_ in emphasized on the efforts build a ‘people’s army’, a critical component of Mao’s “protracted people’s war” [\\[xxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn24). The protracted war, as per the document, would pass through three stages: first the ‘guerrilla warfare’, followed by ‘mobile warfare’, where the guiding principle would be “fight when you can win, retreat when you can’t” and the third stage of ‘positional warfare or the conventional war’, which would be waged face to face with the enemy. The document underlined that a ‘people’s war’ was inconceivable without a ‘people’s army’. There fore the effort of the party, says Prakash Singh, to build and develop a ‘people’s army’ was to be of vital significance in the revolutionary movement [\\[xxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn25). The armed component, People’s Guerrilla Liberation Army (PGLA) was to remain subservient to the Centre Committee(CC), the highest decision making body of CPI (Maoist). The PGLA consists of three types of forces: 1. Main Forces: These include Companies, Platoons, Special Action Teams which could move any where to participate in the war under instructions of CC. Main Forces were supposed to be better armed and include members with political consciousness and superior fighting skills. 2. Secondary Forces: These are local guerrilla squads, special guerrilla squads, division level Action Teams who will operate in a specific area and target the enemy forces. The aim was to harass and tire the enemy forces by constant attrition. 3. Base Forces: These are people’s militia which will include tribal militias, which should have the capacity to harass the enemy forces continuously. On the operational front insurgents have been quick to learn from their mistakes. During the last decade, the insurgents in order to cripple the state machinery, disrupted the train services by blowing up the tracks or by high jacking trains. Having realized that disruption of such essential services was turning public opinion against them, the insurgents in the last 5 years have generally refrained from it. The attacks on railways have dropped from 31 in 2011 to just 1 in first three months of 2016 [\\[xxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn26). **_Changing Maoist Tactics_** While guerrilla warfare in form of ambushes and other shoot and scoot methods still dominate their warfare tactics, insurgents over the years have gained considerable operational momentum across various bands of tactical spectrum. The Maoist have achieved high level of precision and sophistication in the use of IEDs and landmines. IEDs have accounted for a large chunk of security force casualty. More than 50 percent of the security force casualty is due to IEDs and landmine blasts. In a recent incident in April 2016, 7 CRPF personnel lost their lives in a landmine blast in Chhattisgarh [\\[xxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn27). The Indian official machinery has acknowledged the improvement in Maoist weaponry and operational tactics [\\[xxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn28). These improved tactics have enabled Maoists to inflicted heavy costs on the government. They have achieved some spectacular successes against security forces using an array of tactics. Maoists have indulged in deliberate attacks in the form of a) Camp Attacks b) Entrapment Tactics b) Mobile Warfare. Camp Attacks: In the last one decade Maoists have launched audacious attacks on the security force (SF) camps. Most of the attacks have been on the camps which the SFs have established deep in the Maoist territory. Though Maoists have not shied away from attacking jails and district police lines, camps in remote areas have bore the brunt of such attacks. SF camps in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand have witnessed a number of such attacks. Entrapment Tactics: Maoist have been using this novel tactic with fair amount of success. A small incident is used to lure the security forces to rush to an incident side. Any lapse in following the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) is exploited by Maoist to target the forces. In 2000, a party of 30 police personnel including an Additional Superintendent of Police were killed in Chhattisgarh when they were rushing to a site of an alleged Maoist incident. They travelled without clearance from the ‘road opening parties’ and all the members of the party were killed in a landmine blast. In May 2011, a deliberate intelligence was provided to the troops to lure them into a 4 km-stretch laid with a series of mines. Along with the simultaneous blasting of explosives, a multiple formation conventional ambush was also undertaken on the troops. Mobile Warfare: Maoist in recent passed have exhibited their ability to engage in mobile warfare. This also has been done to convey their gradual transition towards the second phase of their struggle, the ‘mobile warfare’. Multiple PGLA companies have attempted to undertake mobile warfare tactics on SFs formations. While a paramilitary contingent was encircled in Kanker in Chhattisgarh in June 2011, another para military formation was similarly attacked the same year. These resolute and bold attacks by the Maoists have showed their ability to engage the enemy on a neutral battlefield. **India’s COIN Doctrine and Strategy: Successes and Dilemmas** India has faced insurgency right from the initial years of its independence. It may be difficult to pick a year in the last 68 years, when India was not fighting insurgency in some part or some form. Indian COIN strategies have been dynamically evolving with the context and nature of the insurgency. These strategies have evoked extreme reactions. The appraisal of Indian COIN experience varies from being branded as ‘critical failure’ to one that compliments India of “never having lost an insurgency battle” [\\[xxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn29). The ‘baiters’ broadly consider ‘India’s one size fits all’ approach key to its failure [\\[xxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn30). Where as the ‘triumph’ group attributes India’s success to its resilience in handling the insurgency movements. India has been blamed for not having a focused COIN strategy against the Maoists. The experts believe the fact that Maoist insurgency for a long time didn’t threaten the Indian urban elite and was confined to remotest regions of India, explains India’s lackluster approach to this insurgency [\\[xxxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn31). It is only when the Maoists started to expand into urban centers and began targeting the political leadership, did India realize the magnitude of this ‘biggest Internal security challenge’. The efforts in countering Maoist insurgency have given a sense that the initial vacillation on part of India was responsible for the growth of Maoists from fringe entities to one directly challenging the state. The problem is still seen as more having socio economic dimensions than a security threat. Once the fruits of development, it is argued, will trickle down to the most deprived and marginalized, the raison de etre behind the Maoist struggle will vanish, thus leaving it rudderless. **_COIN Campaigns Against Maoists: Historical Perspective_** It is believed that the first wave of Counterinsurgency in Telangana outwardly adopted the classical “double pronged COIN strategy” of strong police action combined with ‘ameliorative’ development measures to win hearts and minds of local population [\\[xxxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn32). How ever it is interesting to examine that this rebellion was not even treated as an insurgency by then government. The available material indicates that the government at that time came to view this as peasant rebellion, as British Indian history witnessed many such rebellions [\\[xxxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn33).Though communist backed movement envisaged a Maoist like struggle to overthrow the powerful elite , the state response was brutal and followed the path which a COIN campaign takes. The government forces in Telangana resorted to harsh police action against the insurgents and their tribal supporters [\\[xxxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn34). In order to rob insurgents of the local support, the state government tried to forcibly relocate tribals from their forest villages into the ‘state camps’. The idea was to a) minimize the support to insurgents and b) create employment by giving them work at the new infrastructural projects which the state had started. This forcible relocation however failed in both its objectives. It is interesting to note that counterinsurgents all over the world adopt almost similar strategies to contain insurgencies. Decades later French would resort to such relocation of locals in Algeria to blunt the cross border support for FLN from Tunisia [\\[xxxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn35). Both the initiatives failed to give any fruitful results. Thousands of tribals died in Telangana as result of this relocation [\\[xxxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn36). The government also raised tribal militias in the form of ‘home guards’ and Village Defence Committees. These local militias were targeted by the insurgents and many were killed. On the other hand, members of these militias became a law unto themselves and killed many suspected insurgents in fake encounters [\\[xxxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn37). Half a century later the neighboring Chhattisgarh resorted to creation of such vigilante group in the form of Salwa Judum which was banned by SC in 2011 on the allegations of human rights excesses against the tribals. It is interested to note how the COIN efforts, despite absence of a declared doctrine, tend to follow a course which seems more like pattern. A lot of similarities in strategy and tactics can be observed when Indian COIN is compared to other COIN models across the world. Colin Jackson calls it a constraint of ‘limited marbles in a pocket”, those can only be juggled in limited number of different ways. The first phase came to end only when CPI leaders decided to participate in the first general elections after independence in 1951. **_Naxalbari COIN: A Kinetic Approach_** The Naxalbari movement was crushed by the state government with effective support from the federal government. The government decided to take on Naxalites with full force. The government launched a joint operation by the army and the police, code named Operation Steeplechase, in the bordering districts of West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The strategy of the security forces was to surround as large an area as possible and seal the routes of entry and exit. The army formed the outer cordon and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) the inner ring. The local police, who were generally accompanied by a magistrate, carried out a thorough search of the area. Suspected Naxalites were arrested while illicit weapons, ammunition, and explosives were seized. Wherever possible, simultaneous action was taken in the neighboring areas thus denying Naxalites any chance to sneak out [\\[xxxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn38). The West Bengal police targeted committed student insurgents either by killing them or arresting them. The ‘fence sitters’ were promised jobs and encouraged to join politics [\\[xxxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn39). Some of the insurgents were absorbed as home guards with a monthly salary. These ‘home guards’ acted as valuable informers by identifying other insurgents. By the end of 1972, almost all the top Naxalite leaders including Charu Majumdar and several others were arrested by the police. Around 8000 naxal members and sympathizers were arrested. The poverty alleviation schemes of both centre and state governments also veered away sizeable section of rural population away from the insurgents. Many experts believe that state’s extensive and violent measures brought an end to Naxalbari movement [\\[xl\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn40). How ever the inability of state to wipe out the remaining traces resulted in insurgents moving to other states and with them travelled the idea of Maoism. **Present COIN Strategy: Kinetic Redux ?** The Government of India essentially treats Maoist insurgency as a ‘Law and Order’ problem which falls under the purview of Police and Public order [\\[xli\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn41). Police and Public order being ‘state subjects’ in Indian constitution, entails that the primary responsibility of handling Maoist insurgency rests with the individual states. The center can extend assistance in the form of providing financial resources and deploying Central Armed Police Forces, which would essentially be in aid to state efforts. The government website lays down its approach to Maoist insurgency as holistic which involves improving security situation, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities, improvement in governanace and public perception system [\\[xlii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn42). A first look at governments stated strategy seems to be a population centric of ‘winning hearts and minds’ but the ground situation reveals a different story. Various state governments have adopted their own individual strategies, choosing their own path to COIN. The current COIN strategy is state specific with support from the centre in terms of manpower and resources. The strategy translates into increasing the troops presence in the critical areas and then saturate these areas with by maximizing troops presence who then prioritize kinetic action against Maoists [\\[xliii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn43). The security forces particularly in Chhattisgarh at present are targeting the insurgents without securing the population [\\[xliv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn44). This has exposed civilian population to collateral damage and abuse during the COIN ops. Such a scenario has increased the Maoist legitimacy and given a fillip to their recruitment. There is a widespread appreciation that current patterns of insecurity dictate that stabilization must precede development. This is not an unreasonable view, it is obviously difficult to develop territory you do not control and Maoists recognize that development can erode their control. Maoists have targeted 1241 economic targets between 2011 and 2015 including roads, power plants, telephone towers, food storage [\\[xlv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn45) etc. to keep the the population insulated from the relief and developmental efforts. The government, in 2009, launched a massive stabilization cum dominance drive by deploying more than 70,000 Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) across Maoist zones in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa. This deployment popularly known as “ Operation Green Hunt”, a term coined by the media, was a step towards territorial stabilization which was to be achieved by dominating the area [\\[xlvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn46). The CRPF and state forces operate jointly forming concentric circles of responsibility. Once the area is dominated for a considerable period of time, it is believed, would lead to stability in security situation and provide opportunity for implementing developmental schemes. These ‘Clear Hold and Develop’ efforts are continuing with government pouring in more forces. **_COIN sans Special Forces_** The CRPF has a long but not very successful record of fighting insurgencies. It has been at the forefront of Maoist COIN operations. It is not a specialized COIN force and as result has suffered the maximum number of casualties in the past decade. In December 2010, Maoist ambushed a CRPF patrol in Dantewada killing 76 soldiers of the 62nd CRPF Battalion, the single largest loss of life in Indian COIN history [\\[xlvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn47). The drawbacks of deploying a non specialized COIN force in the core area of Maoist operations were evident. The attack also exposed chronic deficiencies in India’s main central forces employed to fight Maoist insurgency. Amongst the states fighting Maoist insurgency only Andhra Pradesh has a dedicated specialized COIN force, ‘Greyhounds’, created in 1989. Other states have been fighting insurgency with their regular police forces. It is only in the recent years that Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa have raised their Special Forces [\\[xlviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn48). It would take these forces some more years to reach the level of Greyhounds and much depends on the level of training and resources provided to them. While Andhra Pradesh has done well in containing its insurgent problem, other states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Bihar are struggling to overcome this tide. The escalation of threat and inability of states to raise properly trained special forces pushed Centre to raise counterinsurgency commando battalions called CoBRA (Commando Battalions for Resolute Actions). Ten Battalions of CoBRA were raised in 2009 and they have been given training in counter guerrilla tactics and Jungle Warfare at Army’s elite Jungle Warfare school in Mizoram in India [\\[xlix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn49). The Cobra battalions were deployed during Operation Green hunt. CoBRA battalions have shown better performance than other forces in taking on Maoists but their long term efficacy would be assessed in coming times. Various states have also tried to improvise on the past or existing COIN tools available to counter the insurgents. Chhattisgarh made one such improvisation in 2005, when it decided to raise an auxiliary tribal militia, Salwa Judum, to counter Maoists both militarily and ideologically. **_Salwa Judum_** Raising a local auxiliary force has been a fairly common COIN strategy. The outsourcing of security responsibilities to auxiliary non-state militias that operate with little oversight, training or accountability, has been resorted to by counterinsurgents all over the world with mixed results. The CIDG in Vietnam, the Malaya Auxillaries, the firqats in Yemen, the Ikhwanis in Kashmir have been part of such COIN strategies. Again a limited marbles syndrome. Salwa Judum “Purification Hunt” in Chhattisgarh was such an effort by the state to push war against Maoists into their own backyards. It was created in 2005 by organizing tribal youth and surrendered Maoists into well equipped vigilante auxiliary tribal militia, who would take on Maoists on their own turf [\\[l\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn50). The creation of Salwa Judum was a step towards the efforts of the state to localize their own forces. It was envisaged that a force comprising of sons of the soil would a) augment the human intelligence networks and b) provide alternative employment opportunities to the tribal youth. Salwa Judum camps were set up to provide refuge to tribal people displaced by Maoists and also act as safe zones. The idea was that Salwa Judum would act as a force multiplier and would help security forces in bridging the cultural gap between forces and the tribals. The members of Salwa Judum provided valuable information to forces. They were at times able to infiltrate Maoist ranks. As a result, government forces were able to inflict heavy losses on Maoists. How ever all this came at a heavy price. The were allegations of torture, extortion and rape against Judum members. There emerged ‘warlords’ within the judum who would vie for control of refugee camps and also the area surrounding the camps [\\[li\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn51). They at time tried to operate independently of the security forces. There were also incidents when Judum members used violence to settle their individual tribal animosities. These local militias if not supervised closely tend to operate within the zones of their own self interest and at times cross purposes with counter insurgent force. The story seems all too familiar. The tribal militia raised by British in Yemen, ‘the firqats’ started working independently fighting their own little war. The allegations of excesses on Afghan Local Police, have made their role controversial [\\[lii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn52).Salwa Judum like CIDG and Malayan tribal militias did act as a ‘force multiplier’ but it came at a substantial cost. Amidst growing allegations of torture, rape and murder, the Supreme Court of India banned Salwa Judum in 2011 [\\[liii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn53). Salwa Judum did create an unprecedented pressure on Maoists in Chhattisgarh and the latter responded by killing Judum members and their families. The allegations of excesses how ever robbed Judum of its credibility rendering an effective COIN instrument redundant. **_Indian COIN Dilemma: The Debate Rages_** There have been raging debates about the utility of different COIN models in the Indian scenario. Experts believe that Maoist insurgency posturing itself as a ‘people’s war”, mandates a more classic COIN build on the notions of competitive state building to address economic and governance deficiencies [\\[liv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn54).It requires a population centric approach of winning hearts and minds rather then a enemy centric approach of highly kinetic operations [\\[lv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn55). Some feel that India’s counterinsurgency strategy is strongly influenced by British campaign against the Malayan Communist Party [\\[lvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn56). How ever the strategy of winning ‘Hearts and Minds’ has not been at the core of Indian COIN strategy. Even Gerald Templar called “hearts and Minds” “that nauseating phrase I think I invented” [\\[lvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn57). The Indian efforts at winning hearts and minds have been put into practice only when the successes were first achieved by kinetic operations. Indian COIN efforts have invariably preferred trading “hearts and minds” approach with highly kinetic enemy centric tactics. Though insurgencies have been contained but these have not been wiped out completely. One western expert thinks that India has done tremendously well in managing the problem and not allowing them to get out of the hand [\\[lviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn58). In spite of substantial drop in insurgent violence, the insurgency is not dead in Kashmir and NE. The population in these areas still remains largely unintegrated, a drawback believed to be inherent with the highly kinetic enemy centric approach. Indian security leadership feels that an enemy centric approach is best suited for Maoist insurgency, where the fear of population seceding from India is remote. They cite the success of Andhra Pradesh in curbing the Maoist problem with enemy centric drives of kinetic operations. The success Andhra Pradesh COIN campaign without a declared COIN model has allowed experts draw their own lessons from it. Government of India also advocates that other states fighting insurgency adopt the Andhra Model [\\[lix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn59), without really explaining what this model is? **Deciphering Andhra Success** Amidst the grim Maoist landscape of India, one state seems to have charted a completely different course for itself and thus has a different story to tell. A story of success and optimism. The state of Andhra Pradesh (AP) seems to have turned the tide against the Maoists. It is today hailed as the “only success story’ in the Maoist tragedy. AP which in 90s was the hub of Maoist violence has seen a dramatic drop in Maoist related incidents. The total number incidents in 2015 dropped to just 35 as against over 500 in 2005 [\\[lx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn60). AP was the first state to raise a specialized force to deal with the Maoists. The credit for the turn around is generally given to the elite ‘Greyhound’ force, trained to live and operate in the jungle as the guerillas do, and fight the Indian jungle equivalent of a “bush war” [\\[lxi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn61). Greyhound was raised in 1989 as a specialized counter Maoist force, to conduct small unit guerilla counter offensive. It is said that AP drew inspiration from the infamous Selous scouts of Rhodesia [\\[lxii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn62). The force underwent rigorous training and was provided with superior equipment (particularly communications technology). It was able to rapidly deploy and effectively operate in Maoist terrain. The Greyhounds have been extremely effective, but they did not operate in isolation. Their success was possible by forging synergetic relationships with district police and intelligence agencies. The coordinated police strategies improved the intelligence sharing between the security agencies by deploying cross trained regular police units with the Greyhounds. The members of the Greyhounds were drawn from regular state police by following a strict selection process. They were given 60 percent extra salary in the form of risk allowance. They were also provided with subsidized housing, family welfare and other attractive benefits. These additional benefits ensured that Greyhounds attracted the best talent available. They operated in small units for extended periods in remote forests and hilly regions. These small units were given training in local customs and they had to learn local language. This proved to be an asset as these unit members were able to forge bonds with the tribals and villagers. These units were quite akin to “Tribal Engagement Teams” which Major Gant experimented with in Afghanistan [\\[lxiii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn63). The Greyhounds model is today treated as success story and other states have followed AP by raising their own specialized forces. Merely aping creation of a specialized unit may turn out to be a futile exercise unless the entire institutional environment which contributed to Greyhounds success is not replicated. The success of the Greyhounds was predicated on the robust intelligence sharing cycle between three critical units, Greyhounds, district police and Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB). The raw intelligence collected by district police was further developed by SIB and once actionable was fed to Greyhounds who would then execute it. After the execution, the information gathered in the form of seized documents and arrested insurgents, was passed back to district police and SIB for further exploiting and analyzing it. The arrest of Maoists was followed by sustained interrogation by SIB and the district police would simultaneously verify new information collected from the interrogation, on the ground. By this way the intelligence was reprocessed and again fed to Greyhounds for the next action [\\[lxiv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn64). While General McChrystal, the newly appointed JSOC commander in 2004, was struggling to put in place the necessary framework for implementation of his Find Fix Finish Exploit and Analyze (F3EA) strategy, another COIN special force, thousands of miles away, less equipped both technologically and militarily, was implementing his F3EA strategy with sinister precision and reaping rich dividends. It seems that Greyhounds were executing General McChrystal’s plan the way he wanted, only that the battlefield was Andhra Pradesh not Iraq and the insurgents were Maoists not Al Qaeda in Iraq. On many occasions Greyhounds acted as a ‘Direct Action” force by neutralizing top Maoists and conducting raids at Maoists hideouts. These direct actions were well coordinated actions with operational back up support from the local police and SIB [\\[lxv\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn65). A greater focus on the success of Greyhound (which they truly deserved) has led experts to label the AP model as an enemy centric kinetic approach. How ever this success was possible only with a well crafted community development program by the state government. The state government very early had achieved a fair understanding and appreciation of the Maoist game plan. It conceived various rural development and empowerment schemes. The focus was not on big grand projects with long gestation periods but small captive schemes which could deliver in short duration and thus have an immediate impact. The government between 2004 and2010 implemented various rural developmental schemes like ‘Remote and Internal Areas Development Projects” (RAID), small irrigation projects and health insurance schemes. These developmental initiatives undermined the ability of Maoists to recruit and mobilize new members [\\[lxvi\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn66). At the same time government engaged with Maoists at political level. The political engagement was seen by Maoists as a recognition of the political dimension of their movement. This thaw resulted in a brief ceasefire between Maoists and Government in 2004. The ceasefire period proved to be a blessing in disguise for the state. It was successfully exploited by the police and Greyhounds by infiltrating the cadres of Maoists. For the first time in decades Maoists came out of the jungles. The police and Greyhounds were able to profile Maoists who were earlier unknown faceless entities with only aliases. Many Maoist cadres were lured towards politics and some of them joined political parties. The Government had also come up with an elaborate surrender and rehabilitation package which resulted in surrender of hundreds of Maoists. The Andhra Government based its COIN strategy on the judicious mix of enemy centric and population centric approaches [\\[lxvii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn67).Analysts believe that ceasefire period, though short, played an important role in turning the tide against the Maoists, when state machinery gathered extensive information about the Maoists which they later utilized with devastating effects [\\[lxviii\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn68). The Greyhound model is viewed as an oasis of success within unsuccessful arid landscape of Maoist insurgency. Yet some experts are leery of the triumphant claims made by Andhra Pradesh as well as the potential to model the Greyhound success. These experts see enough reason to believe that the Greyhounds did not defeat the Maoist insurgents outright but merely displaced them to neighboring states. This corresponds with data that shows Maoist activity surged in neighboring Chhattisgarh as it declined in Andhra Pradesh. Second, the gains in Andhra Pradesh are still new and it is too early to conclude the demise of Maoist activity [\\[lxix\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn69). **Conclusion** Individual states facing insurgency had the independence of opting for the COIN strategy best suited for them. How ever the choices were made less on suitability, more on political expediency. The mobilization capacities of insurgents created perverse interests among some political parties to harness these for electoral benefits. There have been reported incidents where politician have asked Maoists to issue diktats in their favor [\\[lxx\\]](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/red-salute-india%E2%80%99s-maoist-maelstrom-and-evolving-counterinsurgency-doctrines#_edn70). Analysts believe that the extensive influence which Maoist exercise over 120 districts across 12 states is a serious blow to the internal legitimacy of Indian state. The fact that Maoist legitimacy is restricted to the most deprived sections of the society does mandate a serious thinking on part of Indian state to ameliorate the grievances of this extreme end of Indian societal scale. It is their support, though at times reluctant, which has transformed the current phase of Maoist “People’s War” as the strongest and most violent in history. States have recently started to employ serious efforts to defeat the insurgency. Every state needs to raise special forces and provide them rigorous training in ‘counter guerilla’ tactics and jungle warfare. A Maoist guerrilla can only be countered by a state guerrilla. The operating environment of these special forces has to demonstrate employment of superior tactics to defeat the insurgents. States need to synergize their efforts by launching coordinated operations thereby denying Maoists any space for maneuverability. These efforts need to be supplemented by well crafted development schemes. It is important to segregate the population from the insurgents both operationally and ideologically. The hawks and the doves need to be viewed and treated differently. The federal/central government should strive to seize strategic initiative by putting in place a well coordinated ‘hub and spoke’ kind of COIN architecture where each state acts as a critical spoke. The central government as a hub would try to harmonize the individual state interests with the overall national interest. Indian counterinsurgency has to work with a dual objective of defeating the insurgents militarily and fully quell the insurgent impulses. These would need institutional overhauls. The conflict over the distribution of resources can be mended with economic development, but the bigger challenge would be to create a system where the distribution of power is not controlled by the traditional elite. **End Notes** \\*I reached the site the same night as a part of National Investigation Agency team. \\[i\\] Khan, M Akbar (1975).

He has in-depth experience in law enforcement and counterterrorism, having supervised many important terror related investigations to include conspiracy in the Mumbai terror attacks, the Patna serial blasts, the Bodh Gaya serial blast, and many more. He is among the rare officers who have been twice conferred with the Gallantry Medal, the highest bravery award, by the President of India. He is also a recipient of the Police Medal for Meritorious Services. Sajid Shapoo is also a recognized national resource person on Al Qaeda and Lashka-e-Tayeba. He is currently pursuing his Masters in International Affairs at Columbia University , New York. ## Comments This is one of those \"National Security Issues\" that has somehow evaded the world's attention if not for the longitivtiy but for the sheer destruction caused by it. Sajid does a fantastic job of condensing this complicated topic and encompassing the essence of the struggles, failures, successes and recommendations for the way forward. Sajid's views come not just from an academic point of view but a view of a practitioner as well as someone who has been on the ground and being part of the machine that had to respond to this threat. Thank you for the wonderful writeup. The detailed and in-depth writing that starts with tracing the Indian Maoist history to the current policy decisions of the government, this is an exceedingly well researched paper. The analogy of the hawk hunting for its prey aptly sets the tone of this article - a story of the Naxalite movement in India, the tactics used by the insurgents, the COIN strategies of the Indian security forces and the analysis create a thorough understanding of the Maoist Movement in India. Given the scale of causalities suffered by both civilians and the security forces and the seeming inability to stop this covert warfare in the recent past, I have been looking to understand the genesis of this movement in India, the role of the local population and the counter by the state. This article by Sajid Shapoo, an innate storyteller, makes a technical piece of writing such as this, a valuable and enlightening read! Very informative and comprehensive",

The malware created a botnet controlled by the Russian GRU. **April 2022**. Hackers targeted a Ukrainian energy facility, but CERT-UA and private sector assistance largely thwarted attempts to shutdown electrical substations in Ukraine.

Previously, 28 people from the district worked in the Maoist party and their number has come down now because of the efforts being made by the State Government and Bhadradri Kothagudem Police to wean away Maoist’s influence in the district. The family members of the underground Maoists have to take the responsibility of encouraging the Maoists to surrender for leading a normal life. The government provides support for the rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists, the SP said, adding that the Maoist leaders were terrorising innocent tribals and forcing them to join the banned Maoist party to engage them in illegal activities for their selfish interests. Knowingly and unknowingly, some went underground and now find it difficult to join the mainstream of life. **Read less...** | | May - 2 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders are resorting to acts of violence in Bhadradri Kothagudem District of Telangana, said Bhadrachalam, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Paritosh Pankaj, on May 2, reports Telangana Today.

In a statement, ASP Pankaj said, Maoists were committing criminal offences to show their presence and harassing the innocent tribal people of the agency areas. The Naxals \\[Left Wing extremists, LWEs\\] have become obstacles to development. The top leaders of the Maoist party were compelling their lower-level cadres to commit illegal activities with the aim of extorting money and troubling innocent tribals in many ways for their selfish interests. Minor boys and girls were being tortured by the Naxals forcing them to join the Maoist party. The ASP noted that many cadres attracted by the ‘Operation Chayutha’ are planning to surrender, but they were being prevented doing so by Maoist top leadership. **Read less...** | | May - 11 | Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders, who claim to be fighting for ‘Jal, Jungle and Jameen’ (water, forest and land), were exploiting lower rank cadres to live a lavish life, stated Superintendent of Police (SP), Vineeth G, in Bhadradri Kothagudem on May 11, reports Telangana Today.

Maoists like Sodi Jogaiah, Rajesh, Sodi Mada and others, killed in encounters, were made to join the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] when they were minor in age and the party top leadership should take responsibility for their deaths, the SP said.

Previously, operations in remote and interior areas used to be paused during the rains, inadvertently giving space to Maoists to carry out recruitment drives or hold meetings with villagers. For the past three-four years, however, specially trained units of state and central security forces have pressed on with operations in forests in monsoon, resulting in the killing of 29 Maoists in encounters since 2020. The past years’ operations have been an example against the perceived notion that security forces wouldn’t be able to carry out operations due to overflowing nullahs, canals and slippery terrain in the forests of Bastar, a Police officer said. Bastar range Inspector general of Police (IGP) Sundarraj P told that security camps established in more than 60 spots in the remote areas have “choked the Maoists” and become “bottleneck points” for movement of the insurgents, while giving forces access to the forests. “Earlier, operations would be stalled but for the past 3-4 years, our ops continue during the (rainy) season, bringing results. CRPF \\[Central Reserve Police Force\\], CoBRA \\[Commando Battalion for resolute Action\\] and Special Task Force \\[STF\\] will be carrying out operations as they are well trained in jungle warfare. An action plan is in place to deal with the challenges of monsoon in the forest and conduct searches,” Sundarraj said. The inter-state operations on bordering areas like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra will also be intensified in the coming weeks and the jawans were well equipped for it. The morale of SFs is high despite casualties, the senior Police officer said. “We have recorded significant positive operational outcomes during this monsoon, since we have made decisive inroads into the erstwhile Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] strongholds by opening strategic operational base camps,” said Sundarraj. **Read less...** | | July - 12 | The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kot **Read more...** The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has strongly condemned the decision of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), party Telangana State Committee ‘spokesperson’ Jagan said in a statement released to the media in Bhadradri Kothagudem of Telangana on July 12, reports Telangana Today. Jagan called upon the public to revolt against the ‘fascist Brahmanical Hindutva agenda of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of the UCC. As the people’s opposition towards the BJP’s nine-year rule was on the rise, the BJP was planning to execute its divisive and communal agenda. Through the UCC, Hindutva forces want to create a nefarious divisive line based on religion prior to the five state elections and the general election in 2024. In the last nine years of Narendra Modi's rule, the Indian economy has witnessed prolonged stagnation and decline, he said. Poverty, diseases, the gap between the rich and the poor, and attacks on minorities, dalits, and adivasis have reached levels never seen before. More than 800 million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Jagan noted that the BJP was trying to divert all these from the public’s mind. There would be a threat to the religious rights of minorities, tribals, and even Hindus because of the UCC. The BJP was also dehumanising the Muslim community and wrongly projecting them. There was a need to build a mass movement against the UCC, Jagan added. **Read less...** | | July - 13 | The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. **Read more...** The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on July 13 issued ‘wanted’ notices for top Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leaders in connection with the double murder of former Andhra Pradesh Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Siveri Soma and Kidari Sarveshwara Rao, reports Telangana Today. The Maoist leaders for whom wanted notices were issued are Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Venkata Ravi Chaitanya alias Aruna. In its statement, the NIA said Aruna and Gajarla Ravi are the key executors of the Maoist strategies in Andhra Pradesh. The NIA informed us further that Aruna led the Maoist group that killed the former MLAs. The double murder took place while Kidari Sarveshwara Rao and Siveri Soma were visiting an interior village in the Araku assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. NIA re-registered the case on December 6, 2018 and took up the investigation. In June 2021, the NIA filed a supplementary chargesheet in the case against a woman area committee member of the Maoist group. The NIA said the woman Maoist leader, whom they identified as Kalavathi alias Bhavani, was instrumental in providing logistical support to the team that carried out the killing. **Read less...** | | July - 14 | Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Time **Read more...** Reports of fresh 1,200 Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) recruits and their training by the Maoists in the bordering District of Chhattisgarh have left Security Forces (SFs) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra on their toes along the 180-kilometre border with the state, reports The Times of India on July 15. Maharashtra forces, which have already alerted the Central Government about the Maoists trying to bounce back in Chhattisgarh, have put their security and intelligence units on high alert on the stretch between Kanker-Narayanpur and Bijapur national park. A senior official from the security and intelligence wings said around 1,000 cadres have been recruited by the Maoists in Dantewada and Sukma regions. Another 200–250 new cadres were recruited by the Maoists in South Bastar. \"Earlier, there were barely 50–100 cadres in south Bastar and 200–400 in Dantewada and Sukma, which now have swelled to a substantial number after fresh recruitment,\" said the official. He said the concern was that Maoists would regroup and try to bounce back to their former strength in Chhattisgarh, which would not augur well for Gadchiroli and Gondia across the border in Maharashtra. Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) Sandip Patil, also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Operations (ANO) for Maharashtra, said the central government has been briefed about the developments in Chhattisgarh, which may now affect Maharashtra too, but did not divulge further details. \"Maharashtra forces are ready with strategies to counter any fresh threats,\" he said. It’s been learned that the Maoists are planning major attacks on Police posts that the Governments of different states are opening in their strongholds in central India. The Maoists’ ‘technical and research’ wing is said to be developing Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED) to blow them up near Police posts after mounting them on tractors or four-wheelers used in the rural areas. The Maoists are also developing drones to carry and drop up to five kilograms of explosives on Police Stations. In the latest issue of their mouthpiece, the Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists, LWEs\\] claim to have well responded to the aerial attacks and surveillance in Chhattisgarh with their counter strategy. **Read less...** | | July - 15 | To choke the flow of funds to Naxals \\[Left Wing Extremists (LWEs)\\] in the state, the Bihar Police has intensified its crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts, reports Deccan Herald on July 16.

The anti-Naxal crackdown by the Special Task Force (STF) along with other Security Forces (SFs) has dried up the weapons pipeline, leading to the number of armed extremists dropping drastically in the state, said a senior Police officer. \"Now the Bihar Police, in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other concerned wings of the government, have intensified their crackdown on the cultivation of illegal poppy in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui districts in the state\", Sushil Mansingh Khopde, Additional Director General (ADG-operations), STF, said. The ADG said despite law enforcement agencies destroying hundreds of acres of poppy plants each year, inputs suggest that clandestine opium poppy cultivation is present in certain pockets in Gaya, Aurangabad, and Jamui Districts. \"Inputs also suggest that Maoists \\[Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist)\\] have been using opium cultivation as a source of revenue in these areas. They levy a 'tax' on poppy cultivators and small enterprises. Law enforcement agencies destroyed around 600 acres of poppy plantation in these areas in 2021, and in 2022, around 1200 acres were destroyed\", the ADG said, adding, \"The concerned district police and other agencies have been instructed to keep a vigil on clandestine opium poppy cultivation in specific areas in the district.\" Further, ADG Khopde said, \"The number of Maoist-affected districts will further reduce in the coming months. No major Maoist incidents have been reported till June this year. Some armed cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on the Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger. The STF and Central forces have confined them there.

In a press note issued on November 23, the OSD reminded people that Maoists had issued a statement urging the people to boycott the impending Assembly elections slated for November 30. He, however, reassured the public of the foolproof security arrangements in place to ensure the smooth conduct of the elections. The Maoist action team, reportedly comprising members such as Kunjam Idumal alias Mahender, Kovvasi Ganga alias Mahesh, and others, has reportedly crossed into the Mulugu area with intentions to disrupt the elections. Their strategies allegedly involve targeting security personnel, people’s representatives, political leaders, and officials involved in election duties, instigating fear and chaos among the public. “To combat this threat, Mulugu police have initiated stringent measures, including drone surveillance, cordon search operations, tactical vehicle checks, and area dominance,” the OSD said, emphasizing the grave risk posed by the Maoists to politicians and others, urging the people to remain vigilant and cautious. **Read less...** | | November - 23 | Jharkhand Chief Minister (CM) Hemant Soren, on November 23, declared that the state Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are in the concluding stages of eliminating Naxal \\[Left Wing Extremism, LWE\\] menace in the state, reports The Telegraph.

    "full_text": "[Skip to main content](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#content) Author ### [Pearl Pandya](https://acleddata.com/staff/pearl-pandya) South Asia Research Manager _On 21 May, Indian security forces killed the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI (Maoist)), Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, in Chhattisgarh state. He was killed alongside 27 other cadres of the CPI (Maoist), the largest of the Maoist armed groups waging the Naxal-Maoist insurgency. Basavaraju’s death marks one of the most significant casualties in the Naxal-Maoist insurgency’s history, which first broke out in 1967 as a people’s war to secure the rights of socially disadvantaged groups — mainly landless laborers and tribal people. It is now concentrated in the tribal heartland of rural Central India, colloquially known as the Red Corridor.&nbsp;_ _In this Q&A, ACLED South Asia Research Manager Pearl Pandya discusses the Indian state’s recent successes and what they mean for the Naxal-Maoist insurgency, one of the longest-running insurgencies in the world._ ## **The death of Basavaraju, the highest-ranking leader of the CPI (Maoist) to have ever been killed in combat, is obviously extremely significant. What sort of operations did we see from the Indian security forces leading up to it?** The Indian government held Basavaraju responsible for some of the insurgency’s deadliest attacks to date, including the 2010 Dantewada ambush, in which 76 paramilitary soldiers were reportedly killed.[1](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote1) So his killing certainly marks a major breakthrough, and it did not come out of the blue. Indian security forces have been increasing pressure on Naxal-Maoist rebels since the launch of Operation Kagar by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led national government in January 2024 ( _see graph below_). Security forces have engaged in more forward deployments involving coordinated action between central and state-level forces to pursue a stated aim of eradicating what the government calls “Left Wing Extremism” by March 2026.[2](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote2) Greater cooperation between levels of government during this period has been supported by the BJP’s victory over the more progressive Indian National Congress in the December 2023 state elections for Chhattisgarh. Recent operations have spanned multiple days, as forces have encircled militants in forested areas and limited their escape routes. An increasing number of surrenders by Naxal-Maoist cadres has likely improved intelligence on militant whereabouts.[3](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote3) Not only has the frequency of clashes between Indian security forces and Naxal-Maoist rebels increased, so, too, has the lethality of those clashes. In 2025, in particular, these clashes have become increasingly deadly. ACLED records at least 255 people killed so far in 2025 compared to 301 people in the whole of 2024. The rebels have made up the overwhelming majority of these fatalities. This suggests two things: the Naxal-Maoist cadres are likely weakened and unable to put up much of a resistance, but also that India might be going for an all-out military victory, preferring domination on the ground over arrests and surrenders. Close footnote ## How have the Naxal-Maoist rebels responded to this more aggressive approach, and what implications does it hold for the tribal communities who primarily inhabit these areas? We have seen a shift in tactics to rely more heavily on remote violence. Our data show an increase in the use of explosive and remote violence by Naxal-Maoist rebels in 2025 compared to the same period last year (see graph below). This escalatory trend is likely to continue, as the rebels look to avoid direct engagement with security forces, who heavily outnumber them in concerted anti-militancy operations. After successful anti-militancy operations, Naxal-Maoist rebels have also [targeted locals](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/) whom they accuse of being police informants. In fact, reported civilian deaths from Naxal-Maoist violence increased by 27% in 2024, when the new approach got underway, compared to 2023. Although violence against civilians in 2025 so far has been slightly lower than the comparable period in 2024, the situation may worsen as the rebels come under increased pressure. However, it’s important to mention that the locals, most of whom are indigenous Adivasi peoples, are not threatened only by the rebels. Human rights groups have expressed concerns over Indian security forces using indiscriminate force during their operations. They claim that civilians, including Adivasi villagers and unarmed cadres, have been killed alongside Naxal-Maoist rebels in some of the more lethal clashes.[4](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote4) Close footnote ## What lies ahead for the insurgency? We can expect a continued escalation in the use of force from the Indian government in line with its nationalistic narrative of being tough on extremists across the board, whether they’re militants in Kashmir or Naxal-Maoist cadres. Recent progress in road and communications connectivity in the Red Corridor, which is home to some of the most rural and isolated areas of India, also allows security forces to go deeper into what were previously rebel sanctuaries. As for the Naxal-Maoist rebels, they are indisputably a militarily weaker force than before. Besides the high number of casualties, both of foot soldiers and senior CPI (Maoist) leaders, their geographic presence has also shrunk.[5](https://acleddata.com/update/qa-what-does-indias-naxal-maoist-insurgency-look-2025#footnote5) And they are aware of this: The CPI (Maoist) has made overtures since March for conditional peace talks, though the central government is yet to formally respond. Having said that, the ideological underpinnings of the insurgency, particularly social justice and land rights for disadvantaged groups, still resonate deeply among the local Adivasi population. The Red Corridor, which contains some of the most mineral-rich areas in the country, has emerged as a flashpoint between politicians, who prefer industrialization, and the locals, who fear the loss of their ancestral lands and subsequent displacement. Naxal-Maoist rebels could continue to find recruitment opportunities in this situation. At the same time, this contestation may also serve as a ready cause célèbre, facilitating their transition into a political movement should they choose to do so.

The two neighbouring countries share the world’s longest [unmarked land border](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/23/india-china-border-skirmishes/). They fought a full fledge war in 1962 and are engaged in sporadic skirmishes since then. Recent military incidents have come to the fore again after a relatively long period of quiet. Tensions have spiked, and in a more recent incident, [20 Indian soldiers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476) were killed in a scuffle that broke out between the two sides, flaring the tension to an unprecedented level and risking a major escalation between the two regional powers. The conflict started when on May 5, a [clash](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/tense-india-china-standoff-himalayan-border-escalate-200527120501581.html) took place between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh area at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) due to Indian intrusion and patrolling in Chinese claimed border territory. Apparently these clashes stalked from contradictory assessments of the demarcation of border itself, but the intrusion did not remain limited to one time and point. On May 9, Indian soldiers repeated the same activity which was checked by the Chinese soldiers and both sides got engaged in yet another brawling contest. Extension of skirmishes to another two to three locations was followed by military buildup in order to gear up responses. The expansion of these brawls at multiple places indicate that Indian Army has been pushing China rather than trying to calm down the situation. [Modi’s meeting](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/india-china-face-off-pm-modi-meets-nsa-chiefs-of-service-staff) with his like-minded national security team earlier also indicated the seriousness of the situation. In response, Chinese foreign ministry also vowed to safeguard its territorial integrity at all costs. Both sides have had military level talks to reduce the tensions but have not been able to restore peace. Going back to [1988 Sino-Indian deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93India_relations), which fostered some kind of tranquility promoting economic linkages and activities; outstanding issue of border demarcation was left unresolved. [Statistically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_GDP_of_China) the two countries were near equals on the world stage at that time; however, material balance of power between the two countries has dramatically changed since then. India has been on a steady path of rising economy but on relative terms its growth has considerably declined. Currently both nations are also engaged in a security dilemma directly and indirectly both. India has always been aspiring to take a lead role in the region and occupy a singular dominant position and this quest was aptly bolstered and fueled by the US in the light of US Grand Strategy for the region. India has exercised unilateral [political influence](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) with most countries while exercising lopsided treaty relations; Pakistan and Afghanistan being exception to this. In the last seventy years, it has annexed Sikkim; carried out military interventions in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh and Bhutan; coerced them with threats of war; and [interfered](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) in their domestic affairs. Nepal has recently been [victimized](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2019/12/20/nepal-a-victim-of-legacy-of-british-colonial-times/) as Indian authorities have released a political map showing 35 kilometers of Nepalese area as part of India. Continuous and unprovoked violations of the cease fire at Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan also reflect pursuits to keep the borders volatile. The regional situation started to change in 2010s, when China grew in [economic power](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/decade-china-west-china-ascent) disturbing existent stalemate. China with its persistent progress has increased its footprint in South Asia with far more friendly relations based on inclusivity, equality and mutual interests unlike Indian coercive strategy. In the last decade, while economic linkages between India and China have grown exponentially, their [political and military relations](https://southasianvoices.org/maintaining-the-spirit-in-2020-reflecting-on-2019-india-china-relations/) have remained tense amidst China’s growing power affording it proportionate say in the regional affairs. The increasing influence has come with a cost of offending India. India’s [foreign policy goals](https://thediplomat.com/2016/12/indias-connect-central-asia-policy-2/) are centered on enhancing its economic and political influence in Asia and around the world. India has been seeking to expand its commerce and trade through India’s North-South Transport Corridor ( [INSTC](http://polarconnection.org/india-instc-nordic-arctic/)) connecting India to Russia, Central Asian countries, Baltic, Nordic and Arctic regions. As Belt and Road Initiative [(BRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) has been expanding with considerable gains for China, India views it as a threat to its endeavors. The US planned [exit from Afghanistan](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-time-us-troops-exit-afghanistan-undermining-agreement/story?id=70908619) is emerging as another challenge adding to India’s frustrations. US diminishing interest and influence in Afghanistan will directly affect India’s goal of regional hegemony. For US, ensuring pro-Indian government and sustained internal stability in Afghanistan are critical factors in cementing Indian influence in the region, which so far seems to be a distinct possibility despite India’s ongoing efforts. Modi’s domestic policies are also taking toll.Abrogation of [Article 370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation_of_the_special_status_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir) and [crackdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-28/india-s-kashmir-crackdown-is-damaging-its-image-overseas) along with burgeoning atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir, enactment of controversial Citizenship Act and unprecedented violence against minorities especially Muslims are clear manifestation of India’s Supremacist approach with roots in Hindutva. Failure to control and cover these atrocities has also added to the frustrations. India is in a denial mode to accept China’s power and is feeling threatened. Indians see Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative as an [encirclement campaign](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20180420_R45194_3d4bf676130e76924f5fea6d2e54d3a78e2200a9.pdf), given how determinedly China has been building its presence in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and other points along the Indian Ocean. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s [Act East policy](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/24861/how-modi-is-broadening-the-range-and-scope-of-india-s-act-east-policy) and the increasing US emphasis on the Indo-Pacific has created a framework for better cooperation thus making India an energeticfriend at a time when many of America’s traditional allies are going [grey](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-06-11/great-demographics-comes-great-power). These actions of India are manifestation of its quest to counter Chinese influence using all possible means tacitly emboldened by US. While both countries have scaled up their military presence in the border region, any military confrontation is likely to bring devastation to the region as a whole. While new cold war is echoing, US desire to use India as countervailing power to China is also inspiring Modi in his quests. The Indian expansionist ambitions coupled with Modi’s self-induced internal strife may stretch India beyond its capacity. China has asked India to be careful not to include the [US factor](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190096.shtml) in its handling of any problem in its relation with China. Accordingly, going forward, either India would have to recognize the new reality and accept an end of its regional domination; or, it would have to find a more [even-keel approach](https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/03/06/india-and-the-mantle-of-regional-hegemon/) in its bilateral relationship with Beijing to make the latter’s forays into the region unprofitable. India simultaneously is playing the upper hand in the occupied Kashmir by carrying out unabated atrocities and offensive military posturing along the LoC. Evermore than before, India itself is trying to create a two front war situation while world powers like US, EU, Middle East are already grappling with their domestic issues. Any conflagration between the three nuclear states in the region (China, India and Pakistan) is a doomsday scenario and has the potential to engulf the region beyond South Asia. Indian decision-making elite are badly suffering from narcissism and they exude an aura of idiosyncratic populism. Confusion is prevailing and any incorrect and incoherent decision would be detrimental once it is seen in the overall strategic equation punctuated with COVID-19, economic regression and an emerging new world order. India needs to open her eyes to evade the pitfall before it is too late. Pakistan and China must play their role in a sagacious and pragmatic manner while ensuring safety and security of their nations and region alike. - [Asia](https://strafasia.com/tag/asia/) - [China](https://strafasia.com/tag/china/) - [India](https://strafasia.com/tag/india/) - [indo-china](https://strafasia.com/tag/indo-china/) - [nuclear](https://strafasia.com/tag/nuclear/) - [Strafasia](https://strafasia.com/tag/strafasia/) About Fida Hussain Malik [2 Articles](https://strafasia.com/author/fidahussainmalik/) Fida Hussain Malik who is a Islamabad based defense analyst and an author of several books on diverse topics. ### Related Articles Analysis ### [The Other Side of the Nuclear Coin](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/) [27th May 2020](https://strafasia.com/2020/05/)[Zeeshan Hayat](https://strafasia.com/author/zeeshanhayat/)[Analysis](https://strafasia.com/category/analysis/), [Environment](https://strafasia.com/category/environment/), [Nuclear](https://strafasia.com/category/security/nuclear/), [Politics](https://strafasia.com/category/politics/), [Security](https://strafasia.com/category/security/)[1](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/#comments) [Print PDF](https://strafasia.com/strafasia.com) Print PDF The advent of fission in 1938 – a process in which an atom, bombarded with neutron is split into two or more parts with the release of a large amount of energy – [\\[…\\]](https://strafasia.com/the-other-side-of-the-nuclear-coin/) Analysis ### [Nuclear Deterrence and Stability in South Asia: Perceptions and Realities](https://strafasia.com/nuclear-deterrence-and-stability-in-south-asia-perceptions-and-realities/) [26th August 2021](https://strafasia.com/2021/08/)[Mahvish Malik](https://strafasia.com/author/mahvishmalik/)[Analysis](https://strafasia.com/category/analysis/), [Economy](https://strafasia.com/category/economy/), [Emerging Technologies](https://strafasia.com/category/security/emerging-technologies/), [Military](https://strafasia.com/category/security/military/), [Missiles](https://strafasia.com/category/security/missiles/), [Nuclear](https://strafasia.com/category/security/nuclear/), [Politics](https://strafasia.com/category/politics/), [Security](https://strafasia.com/category/security/), [Technology](https://strafasia.com/category/technology/)[0](https://strafasia.com/nuclear-deterrence-and-stability-in-south-asia-perceptions-and-realities/#respond) [Print PDF](https://strafasia.com/strafasia.com) Print PDF Pakistani and Indian nuclear capabilities are the key pillars for ensuring peace and security in the region – duly acknowledged by the two states in 2004.

Shah](https://www.orfonline.org/people-expert/kriti-m-shah) _The citizens’ right to protest is a pillar of Indian democracy. While citizens are allowed to peacefully assemble, however, protests and demonstrations sometimes take a violent turn; recent examples are the Jat protests in Haryana and the Kashmir unrest following the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, both in 2016. During such occasions, it is the prerogative of the Indian state to deal with the violent civil protests in a manner that ensures public order and protects citizens from harm. This paper discusses the use of force by security officials during periods of violent civil unrest and seeks to understand the ways and means of dealing with such protests in the country._ ## Introduction India witnessed two large-scale, violent civil protests in 2016—the Jat quota agitation in Haryana in February 2016 and the protests that followed the killing by security forces of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir in July 2016. While the two mass actions differed in both their causes and intended goals, they were nonetheless similar in that the state government’s response to the protests was heavily criticised. In February 2016, the state of Haryana experienced a lockdown as members of the Jat community sought political and economic reservations from the government. In parts of the state, protesters clashed with security forces, killing over 30 people. A few months later, the death of militant leader Burhan Wani sparked mass civilian protests in Kashmir. Security forces were criticised for their use of excessive force against a crowd that engaged in stone-pelting and arson. The use of pellet guns to disperse the crowd caused over 90 deaths and injured many others. These events raised questions on the overarching strategy and effectiveness of India’s crowd-control measures—issues which are not new but remain relevant to this day. In a country like India characterised by a number of religious, ethnic, language and caste divisions, the police are regularly confronted with large-scale protests, riots and incidents of mass civil disorder. In such events of unrest, protesters may react in a violent way against police and security forces, property, or other civilians. It is therefore essential to discuss and deliberate on the ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. Traditionally, in India, police have used _lathis_ or batons, water cannons and teargas to disperse an unlawful assembly. While these methods may have their own merits, it is important to look at those instances where the police have used tactics and equipment in a manner that is excessive or harsh. The conversation must focus on understanding the lessons learnt from civilian protests that begin peacefully but eventually regress to violence and result in high casualties. Keeping in mind the recent events in Haryana and Kashmir, the government should re-examine the methods and tactics used by the police when dealing with civil unrest. While the causes for unrest breaking out in Haryana and Kashmir may have been different, both events witnessed the eruption of violence; the lessons learnt from either state can be shared with the other, and on a national scale as well. Therefore, conscious of the fact that the law and order situation in Kashmir is of an extraordinary nature, this paper seeks to discuss what law enforcement officials can do to improve their policing techniques when civil protests turn violent. What is the role of the police in dealing with violent protests? What equipment or non-lethal weapons should the police use? How can security forces ensure that their response to violence is proportional and fair? These are some of the questions that were raised at a workshop led by Trinath Mishra, who has over 37 years of experience in the police and has served as the Director General of the CRPF, CISF and the Director of the CBI. This paper builds on those questions and the key themes discussed during the workshop that was organised by the Observer Research Foundation in December 2016. ## Violent Civil Protests in India Article 19 of the Indian Constitution protects freedom of speech, allowing citizens, for one, the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms.” This includes the right to form associations, hold meetings, and come out in processions. The Constitutional right to assembly is, however, subject to certain regulations contained in a number of laws, such as the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Police Act of 1861. These laws empower the government to impose certain “reasonable restrictions” on the right to assemble, if such assembly is likely to lead to a disturbance in public peace and order or if it poses a threat to national sovereignty. With this, the Constitution seeks a balance between the freedom of speech guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (b) and social order as defined in Article 19 (3). The police also have the duty to control and regulate crowds while providing citizens the space and peace to exercise their right to assembly. However, there are times when the protest takes a violent turn, either among the protesters or between them and the police. The risk of a protest turning violent has increased in recent times. A political decision in Delhi can trigger a reaction in a part of the country, which in turn can cause another reaction somewhere else. Social media and instant messaging have made it possible for information (and misinformation) to spread like wildfire, causing havoc for civilians and posing problems for law enforcement officials. Article 246 of the Constitution places ‘public order’ and ‘police’ under the jurisdiction of the state. This gives each state government full legislative and administrative powers over the police. Each state’s police force has two components: the civil police and the armed police. While the civil police control crime, the armed police are specialised police units that deal with extraordinary law and order situations. They are organised in the form of battalions which are used as striking reserves to deal with emergency situations arising in the state. Although matters of the police are a state subject, the Constitution empowers the central government to intervene in certain police matters in order to protect the state in times of emergency. [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn1) The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) can deploy Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to the state to assist the state civil police and armed forces. [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn2) While the deployment of additional forces such as the CAPFs to assist the state police is helpful, it is important for the central and state governments to draft policies and strategies that help these forces deal with violent unrest in an organised and lawful manner. ## Crowd Control: Methods and Tactics ### **Drafting appropriate policies** When a protest is planned or announced in advance, police and security officials are able to plan an appropriate crowd-control strategy. Authorities normally anticipate that such planned demonstrations may break out in violence for some reason; this gives the police enough space to prepare for containment of possible trouble and dispersal of the crowd, if necessary. It is the spontaneous gathering of people—as a result of a sudden event or incident—that poses more threat to the police. Thus it is important to draft a preemptive policy that will cover the different ways and means to deal with violent civil protests. This would enable police officers, paramilitary forces, and other law enforcement personnel to learn better techniques and strategies to deal with both peaceful and violent crowds within the ambit of the law. While policy is being drafted, it is important to keep in mind the ground realities of different protests and devise strategies accordingly. At a student protest, for example, security personnel must show utmost restraint and maintain composure during violent disturbances as police reaction to any provocation may easily cross the line and become excessive and in turn result in protesters turning more violent. During a political agitation, police aggression towards demonstrating citizens, or a clash taking a violent turn, could simply prolong the protest. [\\[3\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn3) Indeed, a violent mass of protesting students has to be dealt with differently than a crowd of political agitators. After all, these mass actions are held for different reasons, have different goals, and consist of different methods of agitation. It is imperative that the policies to deal with them are also different. When drafting strategies for the police to deal with violent protests, five important elements must be considered: information, intention, method, logistics, and communication. Any strategy should take into account these elements. Police must acquire as much _information_ as possible about the nature of the event, the grievances of the protesters, and other basic variables. For example, the policy on dealing with communal riots must be different from that on handling mass agitations. A mass agitation could be a student protest, a railway strike, a pro- or anti-reservation protest, or any other protest against the central or state government. These agitations may lead to protesters blocking a road or railway line. Protesters may engage in _dharna_ or sit-in and threaten to not leave until their demands are met. Once they have obtained all the _information_ about the agitation, police officers and other security personnel must also be briefed and trained on what their aims and objective are as law enforcement officials. [\\[4\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn4) Second, their _intention_ should be clearly defined—i.e., are they dispersing the crowd or are they using force against civilians? Then, their _method_ to achieve their intention should be discussed so that all security officers are aware of the organisational structure of the police and their different duties and responsibilities. In addition, _logistical_ elements such as traffic routes, ambulances, proper equipment and gear should also be planned and prepared in advance. Equally important when dealing with a violent and agitated crowd is for the police to be keen on their _communication_ with the public. This includes engaging in media briefings and issuing press releases that keep the public informed about the developments surrounding the protest, especially if the incident persists for a few days. Continued contact and communication between government, police officials, and the public will help in developing trust and will also allow the government to directly address any attempts at misinformation. Sections 141 to 190 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 149 to 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, provide a vast array of preventive and punitive action against those who participate in unlawful assemblies, even in cases where an unlawful assembly is still being contemplated. This allows for the preventive arrest of individuals if the police believe that they will indulge in violent activity. If the police’s _intention_ is to ensure that an agitation does not suddenly turn violent or threaten public and private property, it may adopt such a _method_, by arresting the first- and second-line leaders of a mass movement in advance, thereby denying the protest its leadership. Police may also prevent agitators from gathering in one particular place and focus on posting adequate police reserves at strategic points, in order to deter violence. Certain events of civil unrest in India are communal in nature, and violent communal crowds, protests and riots put a serious strain on the secular foundation of Indian society. India’s history is stained with numerous religious and caste-based riots. Forces such as the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are a specially trained anti-riot force that are deployed to the most politically sensitive parts of the country. They are trained to manage gatherings that are communal in nature and maintain an unbiased attitude when dealing with civilians. When dealing with communal riots, policy strategies should include an immediate response to all situations with a communal implication, frequent press briefings to prevent distortion of news, protecting all places of worship, and maintaining a healthy interaction between all communities. [\\[5\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn5) ### **Role of law enforcement and security personnel** During periods of severe civil unrest, state police forces are often inadequate to deal with the situation. State armed police face issues of manpower shortage, as well as lack of training and proper equipment, forcing state governments to seek help from the Centre which, in turn, deploys the CAPFs. The Union government avoids getting blamed for not coming to the assistance of the state; the state government steers clear of responsibility for any possible wrongdoing that may occur. Over the years, such an arrangement has left state police forces with little capacity to deal with violent civil protests on their own. During the Jat quota protests in February 2016, both the CAPF and the Indian Army were deployed at the request of the panic-stricken Haryana government. The violence that ensued during the demand for quotas claimed over 30 lives and caused massive destruction of public and private property. The decisions made by the state of Haryana during the agitation set a glaring example of police failure at all levels. The police failed to handle the events in a proper manner—either showing indifference or, in some cases, being complicit in dealing with the rampaging mob. This led to the unravelling of even more violence. As the Haryana Police looked the other away, protesting groups of Jats were able to use earthmovers, among other heavy machinery, to dig up roads, block railway tracks, and loot commercial shops. [\\[6\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn6) In a report, the Prakash Singh Committee—set up to probe police and administrative failures after the protest—stated that the Army had sent 74 columns to Haryana, roughly equalling 12 battalions. The report said, “It is a formidable strength, enough to ward off a small scale attack in a particular sector by an invading army. It is extremely unfortunate that Army had to be deployed on such a large scale to deal with internal disturbances.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn7) The Committee also commented on the use of the Army by the state government, stating that it was “distressing” that the Army had not been properly utilised. The report describes particular incidents where the Army was misled into inaction by the local police, by not stopping a mob indulging in acts of destruction and vandalism. The committee also suggested that “states should have some battalions specially trained and equipped to deal with mobs.” [\\[8\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn8) The Jat protests are just one example of the multitude of challenges that arise during a violent civil unrest. While local police may be able to deal with simmering tensions in a locality for some time, calling in the CAPFs must be done with greater responsibility. Usually, when outside forces are called in, their inadequate understanding of the ground realities and local grievances only serves to worsen the situation. For example, the troops may not know the local language, inhibiting their ability to communicate properly with protesters. ### **Problems faced by police and security forces** When troops are deployed suddenly after violence has escalated or the state government forces have been overpowered, there are delays in understanding and formulating a proper strategy to deal with protesters due to confusion over specific roles, or planning and preparation on the part of civilian authorities. Non-local forces may also discover that their efforts to secure peace are being hampered by improper coordination, liaison and cooperation with local police. It is therefore important for civil authorities that have sought the assistance of outside forces to clearly delineate duties and responsibilities. There also may be problems arising out of command structures; this can be addressed by improving communication and liaison channels. Adding more complexity is the politicisation of the Indian police forces. Local police often have their own political biases and affiliations which interfere in their ability to monitor and control civil unrest. The main features of the police system that exist today are based on the colonial legacy of the British and the Police Act of 1861. Although since independence a number of states have passed their own legislation that introduced changes in the state police forces, the lack of public accountability in the police structure remains largely unchanged. In the aftermath of the violence of Jat protests, the investigation report stated, “Our established institutions and the recognized hierarchy should be able to rise to the occasion, howsoever serious, and deal with it. The problems of the kind we all witnessed arose because institutions have been subverted, procedures have been corrupted and the police organization in particular has been politicized to an extent where it has become almost dysfunctional and incapable of handling very grave situations.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn9) The fact that the country’s internal security apparatus rests on the police force that is, in turn, managed by the political executive explains to a significant degree the inefficiencies that hobble its proper functioning. Most states have their own police colleges and academies where training is directly imparted to recruited constables and police inspectors. Some of the courses include physical training, weapons trainings, maintenance of law and order, as well as crowd and riot control. However, these are part of the basic training course which may be a few months to a year long and taught along with other subjects. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) also runs a number of specialised courses for officers. However, even with these training schools, police training across India is allotted on average only one percent of total police expenditure. [\\[10\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn10) It is important that both at the central and state levels, the training of police in methods of crowd control is given adequate attention. This includes theoretical teaching about the nature of different types of protests, lessons from past experiences in dealing with such protests, as well as regular updated information about the ground realities in different areas that may be prone to unrest. This must be accompanied by field or outdoor training in which police and security forces study and apply classroom knowledge on the tactical principles in crowd control. These would depend on the type, size and militancy of the crowd. As P.P.S Sidhu, a retired IPS officer states, “Formations for mob control are based on standard infantry formations. If the constabulary is well drilled in these formations, no difficulty will be experienced in adapting the small variations required for efficient mob and riot control.” [\\[11\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn11) In his report, Sidhu describes the four basic formations for riot control, which include: column formation (which is used by police during riots to move from one point to another); line formation (which is used for blocking the mob’s movement and is ideally suited when teargas is to be used); wedge formation (ideally suited for clearing an area or breaking up a crowd); and the diagonal formation (used to disperse the crowd in a particular direction). [\\[12\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn12) These formations must be practiced in the field so that security forces are well-versed and comfortable using them in real-life situations. While such tactical principles can be taught through the use of a manual in a classroom, regular practice and training will help improve the police force, boosting their confidence when they are faced with a riotous mob. This must also be done with police forces using different non-lethal equipment that is sanctioned for crowd control. While the _lathi_ has become a staple weapon of choice for police forces across the country, its use can be made more effective if police forces are trained well. When a call is made for a _lathi_ charge, police tend to execute it haphazardly, hitting the protesters excessively and injuring scores. The police must realise that even if they are instructed to carry out a _lathi_ charge, being in a proper formation along with fellow security forces, attacking with a _lathi_ and then retreating back into formation, can be more effective both in minimising civilian injuries and in strengthening and defending the security forces as a unit. The proper training of police and security forces is also important due to the shortage of personnel in the country. According to BPR&D’s 2016 annual report, there are 549,025 vacancies in the police force in the country, including both the civil and armed police. [\\[13\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn13) The total number of CAPFs’ strength is at 971,262, with the CRPF having the maximum number of personnel at 294,496. While there is a large number of vacancies in the police force, this is due to institutional problems of hiring. Once a senior police officer retires, the state police administration begins the process of hiring. However, the hiring and subsequent training process takes time, leaving the force un-replenished. Other reasons why there is a constant shortage of personnel is due to financial and budgetary constraints and the fact that many training institutions are subpar. While forces may be hired, they are unable to receive the required training at a national or state training institution because of inadequate resources available there. During a civil unrest situation, therefore, the number of police forces deployed are usually inadequate compared to the number of gathered protesters. This often leads to the situation getting out of hand, as security forces are often compelled to use force to protect themselves given that they are outnumbered. The allocation of appropriate task forces and special forces is equally important. The CRPF is one of the most overused forces armed forces in the country. Though CAPFs such as the BSF, ITBP and RAF have clear-cut mandates and roles they often end up being used to deal with civil protests and supplementing the CRPF. Due to the fact that they are the only paramilitary forces that have riot gear as part of their equipment, the CRPF are often called in whenever there is an eruption of violence. Presently, CRPF is used for VVIP security, counterinsurgency operations, security during elections, and riot control. Besides having multiple roles, the CPRF faces the problem of frequent shifting of their battalions. While a battalion may be posted in an insurgency-afflicted area fighting Maoists for one week, in the next, they can easily be posted cross-country to deal with civilian violence. This practice must be stopped. Their organisational structure, ethos and training methodology does not support taking on such varied responsibilities. It is therefore essential to the government to formulate and earmark specific task forces for different places and situations. Just as there cannot be an overarching strategy to deal with all forms of civilian violence, there cannot be singular task force, namely the CRPF, that is called in to deal with every kind of law-and-order situation. ## **Use of force by security officials** There are times when police and security forces may have to use force in situations of public disorder. The Indian Constitution provides for this under Section 129 of the Criminal Penal Code which gives the power to disperse an unlawful assembly by force to any Executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station. In Kashmir, protesting crowds have primarily involved agitated citizens that weaponise stones against security officials. Police and security force personnel’s use of “non-lethal” pellet guns in response has been indiscriminate and excessive. Each pellet is loaded with lead that, once fired, explodes into smaller pieces. These spread out randomly and haphazardly, increasing the chances of them not only hitting bystanders but hitting a human body in more than one place. At close range, a single lead pellet is likely to hit a person in multiple places on their body. [\\[14\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn14) Research shows that other kinetic impact projectiles such as rubber bullets or bean bags have the same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. [\\[15\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn15) Conservative estimates show that in 2016 alone, over 90 civilians were killed by injuries caused by pellets and over 8,000 people were admitted in hospital with other injuries including permanent blindness. The pellet gun is, deceptively, a non-lethal, _lethal_ weapon. The use of pellet guns in the Valley is by no means a new phenomenon. They were first introduced in 2010 as the “less-lethal” alternative to other weapons. That year, they injured over 1,500 people and caused loss of eyesight in at least 90 others. [\\[16\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn16) Media reports state that doctors in Kashmir have received patients with pellet injuries virtually every week since 2010. [\\[17\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn17) The ‘Standard Operating Procedures to Deal with Public Agitations with Non-lethal Measures” released by BPR&D in February 2011 after the 2010 violence in the state, does not discuss pellet guns, and it fails to list them as crowd control weapons that can be used by the police. [\\[18\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn18) It is therefore puzzling as to why they were extensively and indiscriminately used by the J&K police and CRPF soldiers. The list of equipment and weapons for crowd control recommended by the BPR&D include water cannons, teargas shells, stinger and dye-marker grenades, tasers and lasers, net guns, and stink bombs. [\\[19\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn19) All of these are described as “non-lethal” weapons that are effective in crowd control. Interestingly, the list also includes ‘plastic bullets for mob dispersal’. On the use of plastic bullets, the BPR&D SOP report states that plastic bullets have “not yet been field tested. The .303 version was tested in Kerala and not found to be capable of dispersing a mob. In real life, under stress it is unrealistic for the policeman to be able to judge range correctly. It should not be used from a close distance.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn20) While the use of plastic bullets has been questioned in some countries such as Israel, India has not only failed to test them in the field—it also uses them frequently. In 2013, the J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) stated, “the use of pellet guns by government forces was a serious threat to life”. It declared that the petitions submitted regarding ten people who received serious injury from pellet guns made out a _prima facie_ case of a human rights violation. The commission also reminded law enforcement agencies that they must follow standard operating procedure and use minimum force. [\\[21\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn21) In 2016, after pellet guns were used again to disastrous consequences, a similar plea of help was echoed. The MHA once again set up an expert committee for exploring “other possible alternatives to pellet guns as non-lethal weapons.” In September 2016, in a move widely seen as an effort to save face, before he made an official trip to violence-affected areas, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh approved the use of chilli-based PAVA shells for crowd control in the Valley. [\\[22\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn22) However, while PAVA shells may be a non-lethal weapon that can be used for crowd control, their effectiveness in Kashmir can be questioned. The shells which are filled with organic-chilli based ammunition need to be fired from a distance of four to five metres. This is an extremely short distance, especially when protesters and rioters in Kashmir are prone to violence against security officials. It is therefore unlikely that they provide an adequate deterrent for protesters. It is also improbable that security forces would want violent agitators to get that close before firing at them with PAVA shells. However, irrespective of the political face-saving moves that governments may employ, pellet guns have not yet been banned and the SOPs issued in February 2011 remain largely ignored. The use of pellet guns by both the state and central government in Kashmir has been careless and callous. Irrespective of the uniqueness of the situation, Indian crowd control tactics must adhere to international standards of crowd control. The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) lists the ‘Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials’. It starts by saying that government and law enforcement should develop a range of non-lethal weapons and ammunition that should be carefully evaluated in order to minimise the risk of endangering involved persons. The UNHCR standards also advise that if they are going to use force, they shall as far as possible “apply non-violent means before resorting to use of force and firearms”. Most importantly, the basic principles state that “whenever lawful use of force and firearms in unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and legitimate objective to be achieved.” [\\[23\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_edn23) India’s tactics of controlling a violent crowd therefore not only fail international standards, but are also excessive and disproportionate within their own right. The indiscriminate and lethal use of pellet guns on protesting civilians is a highly disproportionate response to stone throwing by civilians. The use of certain equipment and non-lethal weapons used for control crowd should follow three basic principles: no more force should be used than is necessary; force should not be used as a punitive measure; and it must cease immediately after the crowd has dispersed. Government should ensure that crowd control weapons are absolutely non-lethal, and that they are used in a way that does not threaten human life and the right to protest but rather protects against loss of human life and destruction of property. The government must seriously reconsider the use of pellet guns as crowd control weapons. It must adopt SOP on violent crowd control that uses non-lethal weapons to disperse the crowd and distinguish between violent and peaceful protesters and bystanders. The use of lead pellets increases the chances of a single shot hitting more than one person and fatally injuring them. Security officials must only use force where there is a serious and imminent threat to life and property, and they have exhausted all other means to disperse the crowd. In a state like Kashmir where throwing stones at security officials has become commonplace and predictable, government must provide security officials with proper protective gear. Helmets, masks, body armour and shields should be given to those dealing with protesters to ensure that law enforcement officials are not injured to the point that they engage in violence themselves. ## What Next? The right of citizens to protest and gather peacefully without arms is a fundamental aspect of India’s democracy. While it is also the right of the government to protect civilians from violent protests, certain essential principles need to be kept in mind. The use of pellet guns in Kashmir must not be repeated anywhere else. The MHA should enforce a permanent ban on such deceptive equipment which is more lethal than claimed. It is surprising that despite the persisting fragile security situation in Kashmir, no government has formed a task force or special force specific to the state, one that works solely in Kashmir, knowing the people, their grievances and their plans for future protests. Instead, laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) run supreme, further alienating civilians from the Indian state. The government must seriously examine the possibility of creating a force akin to the RAF, specific to the Kashmir Valley. It should be sufficiently large in number and well-trained to deal with the kind of violent civil protests seen there. While an argument is made for reducing troop numbers in Kashmir, a special RAF-like force would replace other forces present in the state. Stationed in the Valley, the forces’ aims should be to build confidence and trust between themselves and civilians and collect intelligence. A special task force that is based solely in Kashmir would go a long way in resolving grassroot civilian problems and grievances with the state and the army. As the past year’s events in Haryana and Kashmir have clearly demonstrated, India must hold security force personnel to account when there is excessive use of force against civilians, causing either serious injury or death. The government must emphasise that force can only be deployed in severe emergency situations, clearly defining what those situations may be and what type and levels of force should be applied. It is vital for the state to better train the police, especially in J&K and use protective equipment when controlling a large crowd. It is the prerogative of the Indian authorities to enable police and security forces to effectively police crowds, providing them with non-lethal equipment and adequate protection. Most importantly, the country must begin to seriously consider police reforms at the centre and state level. Irrespective of the government or political party in power, state and central police forces must remember to work for, protect, and defend the citizens. By working towards resolving problems arising from the politicisation of the police force, citizens can be sure that even when a civil protest turns violent, police forces will restore public peace and order in a lawful, legal and constitutional manner. ## Endnotes [\\[1\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref1) Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, “Police Organisation in India”, New Delhi: 2008, accessed on 5 January 2017, 39 [\\[2\\]](https://www.orfonline.org/research/dealing-with-violent-civil-protests-in-india/#_ednref2) The CAPFs comprise of the: Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

The two main actors that constitute the best hope for global growth are obviously India and China. Of the two, India is in many ways the better bet. The country’s ‘bottom-up’ economic model (enabling it to better withstand systemic shocks), its demographic composition and its democratic system provide it with a future outlook that is brighter than China’s. Also, it is impressive that, despite endemic corruption, poor infrastructure, and a currently weak and directionless Congress Party-dominated government, India’s economy maintains a growth rate of 6%. Moving into an era of multipolarity, the importance of enhancing ties with a rising power like India is of great strategic importance for the West. At the same time, though, India is facing internal security pressures, albeit largely unknown to many investors and policy makers. Large swaths of Indian territory are plagued by conflict between the state and the long-running Maoist insurgency group known as the Naxalites. If not dealt with effectively, the Naxalites might prove to be too much for New Delhi and turn out to be India’s Achilles heel imperiling its phenomenal global rise. The current manifestation of Maoist-inspired violence in India can be traced back to the period immediately following the country’s independence in 1948. The term Naxal or Naxalite is derived from the Indian village of Naxalbari (West Bengal) where the movement has its roots. The stated goal of the Naxalites was, and remains to this day, to free the poor from the clutches of the landlords, to implement land reforms and destroy the oppressive feudal order in India. A central part their strategy to achieve this goal has been a guerrilla war against government forces in the underdeveloped rural and tribal regions of India. Although the nature of the movement makes it difficult to estimate the group’s size, recent estimates by The Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence service, have placed the numerical strength of the Naxalites at some 20,000 armed fighters, with access to about 6,500 firearms. These numbers would suggest that the Naxalites are almost twice as big as the FARC movement in Columbia, which numbered around 11,000 operatives in 2009. The Naxalites’ organizational structure includes an elaborate hierarchy with a Central Committee at the top, followed by Regional Bureaus, Zonal or State Committees, and District or Division Committees. Following a period of internal strife and fractional splits, in 2004 the a merger occurred to create an umbrella organizational structure for the Naxalite insurgency. This reunification was followed by an upswing in the level of violence. Like all successful or enduring insurgent groups, the Naxalites follow a two-tiered strategy, using violence against their opponents as well as engaging in socio-economic initiatives to win the support of the population. With regard to the latter, it is important to note that the Naxalite insurgency puts much effort into addressing the grievances of the marginalised poor, who are disappointed in – or even hostile towards – the Indian government. For instance, Naxalite fighters have campaigned for women’s rights, have tried to improve the housing situation of those in need, have organised railway strikes, and have run irrigation projects to help farmers increase their harvests. The violent actions that make up the other second pillar of he Naxalite strategy are mostly aimed against the police, Indian government officials and transnational corporations. These attacks are intended to shield the population from capitalist influence. The Naxalites are quite successful in this regard, as the group has managed to take control of certain regions, especially in the Red Corridor, where state power has been eroded or has collapsed altogether. Several factors account for the Naxalites’ ability to pull off tours de force of this kind. First, the manpower that the Indian insurgents brings to bear, gives them the organisational clout needed to wage a large-scale campaign. Second, although the Naxalites are geographically dispersed and not centrally led, the group shows a remarkable commitment to the overall strategy. Although the group’s operatives occasionally lash out at the local population, Naxalite actions generally fit the ambition to create Naxalite-controlled areas to encircle the cities and eventually take over the country. The third explanation of the insurgency’s sustainability is the fact that many Naxalite operatives are active in their native areas. From this, they derive knowledge of the terrain, crucial in irregular warfare, as well as familiarity with the local population and its plight, which makes it unlikely that they will be perceived as interlopers. Another factor that makes it unlikely that the Naxalite insurgency will soon be a thing of the past is the inadequacy of the Indian government’s response. While it is clear that discrimination and poverty of the rural population provide the Naxalites with a support base and a pool of potential recruits, the government’s measures to alleviate the living conditions of the rural poor are generally half-hearted and poorly implemented. Rather, the government tries to quell the insurgency by taking a hard approach with a central role for law enforcement agencies. Thus far however, this hard line has not yielded the desired results. The number of police forces deployed against the Naxalites was recently increased to 76,000, but the insurgency is still alive and kicking. And even regardless of the effectiveness of the government line, it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. India is one of the most underpoliced countries in the world, and there is little chance that the government will deploy the army, reluctant as it is to start a long and messy campaign and to take forces away from Jammu and Kashmir. It appears that the Naxalites are here to stay. All too often, analyses of India are based on the assumption that its rise is inevitable and effortless. For a long time, the western view was that the rest of the world held little allure to the west, but now, the received wisdom on India at business and international relations conferences is an overcompensation of earlier neglect and underestimation. This overly sunny view is as misguided as the prior arrogance. What is needed is a sober analysis of India’s economy and internal security situation. The goal of this article has certainly not been to denigrate the future potential of India or to engage in fear mongering. Rather, we have tried to draw attention to an important actor on the Indian scene that until now has received only minimal international attention. Adding this dimension to current thinking about India will allow investors and policy makers to make informed decisions on when, how and where to invest their money in India. If India is serious about defeating the Naxalites, they will need to deal with the root causes of the group’s appeal in the Red Corridor, which will require addressing poverty, corruption and tribal inclusion issues. Only by doing so can India retain the domestic stability that is a prerequisite for its continued phenomenal rise. ### About The Author ## Article Discussion: ![Small Wars Journal by Arizona State University](https://smallwarsjournal.com/wp-content/themes/swj/images/logo_icon.svg) ### Become a Member To Engage!

India has emerged as one of the most targeted nations for ransomware and data extortion attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, according to a CrowdStrike report. The country tops the list alongside Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, pointing to the growing cyber risk exposure of large, digitally integrated economies. Between January 2024 and April 2025, India accounted for the highest share of regional victims listed on ransomware “dedicated leak sites” (DLSs). These are platforms where cybercriminals expose data from organisations that refuse to pay ransom. CrowdStrike documented 763 victims across APJ during this period, representing 9 per cent of global ransomware disclosures. The report mentioned that ransomware groups like FunkLocker and KillSec, both offering ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), disproportionately targeted India. FunkLocker attributed 21 per cent of its victims to India, while KillSec named 33 per cent. These attacks primarily affected sectors such as manufacturing, technology, industrial engineering, financial services and professional services, all vital to India’s economic backbone. **Corporate India In Crosshairs** CrowdStrike noted that “enterprising adversaries” are now operating with corporate-style efficiency, using artificial intelligence (AI), scalable infrastructure, and strategic targeting to maximise disruption. Many exploit social engineering, unmanaged devices and identity vulnerabilities to gain entry into enterprise systems. One of the most persistent regional threats, SOLAR SPIDER, has consistently targeted Indian banks and financial service providers using phishing lures themed around Swift and Western Union transactions. Between January and May 2025, the group deployed custom malware, including JsOutProx RAT and a new version of Meduza Stealer, through repositories like GitHub and GitLab. India’s inclusion in multiple high-severity attack clusters points to its growing prominence as a digital economy and consequently, a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The report warns that as India accelerates cloud adoption and digital financial services, vulnerabilities in cloud configurations, identity systems and supply chains could be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.

A 2019 Supreme Court judgment awarding the disputed land to the Hindu applicants, finding they possessed a better title, ultimately paved the way for the temple’s construction, even as the court condemned the mosque’s demolition by the mob as an illegal act.[7](javascript:void(0))[Rohan Venkataramakrishnan, ‘SC found 1949 idol installation and 1992 mosque demolition illegal – yet it paved way for a temple,’ Scroll (India), 9 November 2019](https://scroll.in/article/943162/sc-found-1949-idol-installation-and-1992-mosque-demolition-illegal-yet-it-paved-way-for-a-temple) The values of secularism and religious tolerance enshrined in India’s Constitution have long struggled against the realities of its demographics, where Hindus, comprising around 80% of the population, form the overwhelming majority.[8](javascript:void(0))[Stephanie Kramer, ‘Religious Composition of India,’ Pew Research Centre, 21 September 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/) The gradual rise of the BJP, which views India foremost as a Hindu _rashtra_ (nation), further increased the strain on these principles while also emboldening more radical Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) groups within the country.[9](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) Among these is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary group that organized the Babri Masjid’s demolition.[10](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ‘India’s BJP leaders acquitted over Babri mosque demolition,’ The Guardian, 30 September 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/india-bjp-leaders-acquitted-babri-mosque-demolition-case) The BJP has strong ideological and organizational ties with the RSS; Modi himself began his political career as a religious volunteer with the group.[11](javascript:void(0))[Milan Vaishnav, ‘Religious Nationalism and India’s Future,’ Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4 April 2019](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/04/religious-nationalism-and-india-s-future-pub-78703) The mainstreaming of Hindutva politics under the BJP has increased tensions between Hindus and religious minorities, sparking a resurgence in communal violence. India’s Muslim community, which is among the world’s largest Muslim populations, has borne the brunt of this violence. With the BJP galvanizing its supporters around the cause of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2024 elections, the second part of ACLED’s India Elections Special Issue focuses on increased religious polarization as a driver for political violence across India. ## **Religious polarization drives communal violence** The BJP’s decisive victory in 2019 marked a turning point for Hindu-Muslim relations in India, as the party followed through on some of the long-standing demands of Hindu nationalists. In August 2019, just weeks after the elections, the BJP government abrogated Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state.[12](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘India revokes disputed Kashmir’s special status with rush decree,’ 5 August 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/5/india-revokes-disputed-kashmirs-special-status-with-rush-decree) The greater autonomy guaranteed by Article 370 was a consequence of Jammu and Kashmir’s contested accession to India, as opposed to the Muslim-majority Pakistan, at the time of their independence from British rule. The decision to end the special status was perceived as the first step toward changing the demographic character of the state by allowing non-Kashmiris, likely Hindus, to buy land and settle there. A few months later, the government proposed an amendment to the citizenship laws, making it easier for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.[13](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) By specifically excluding persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Hazaras and Ahmadis, from these countries and all religious minorities from neighboring non-Muslim majority countries, such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the policy introduced religion as a basis of citizenship for the first time. Given that secularism was one of the founding ideals that differentiated India from Pakistan, which had been conceived as a homeland for Muslims, at the time of Partition, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) received backlash for violating the constitution’s provisions on equality and nondiscrimination.[14](javascript:void(0))[Al Jazeera, ‘Why is India’s Citizenship Amendment Act so controversial?,’ 12 March 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/why-is-indias-citizenship-amendment-act-so-controversial) Though passed in December 2019, the CAA’s implementation was put on hold amid widespread protests that reportedly left scores dead. On 11 March 2024, just over a month before the elections, the BJP government announced rules implementing the CAA. Inflammatory statements, often coming from senior government members, have further stoked religious tensions. A favored tactic among Hindu nationalists is adding ‘jihad,’ the Arabic word for struggle, as a suffix to various terms, using it as shorthand for imagined Muslim plots to dominate the country. The most prevalent among these is ‘love jihad,’ a conspiracy theory about Muslim men luring Hindu women to convert to Islam under the pretext of romantic relationships.[15](javascript:void(0))[The Wire, ‘Haryana Becomes 11th State to Table ‘Love Jihad’ Law, Congress Protests in Assembly,’ 5 March 2022](https://thewire.in/communalism/haryana-becomes-11th-state-to-table-love-jihad-law-congress-protests-in-assembly) At least 11 state governments, most of them ruled by the BJP, have passed laws banning religious conversions through marriage, lending credence to claims of ‘love jihad.’ During the COVID-19 pandemic, ‘corona jihad’ was a trending hashtag on X (formerly known as Twitter) with Hindu nationalists accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading the virus. The conspiracy theory gained traction after senior members within the BJP-led government dubiously connected an event organized by an Islamic missionary, the Tablighi Jamaat, to the spread of the pandemic within India.[16](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting Muslims spread in India,’ The Guardian, 13 April 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india) Other Islamophobic tropes include ‘land jihad,’ where Muslims are believed to systematically encroach upon public lands through illegally constructed mosques and _madrassas_ (religious schools), and ‘economic jihad,’ where Islamic practices around the sale of halal meat are seen as a plot to financially deprive Hindus by excluding them.[17](javascript:void(0))[Yashraj Sharma, ‘Hamas to halal: How anti-Muslim hate speech is spreading in India,’ Al Jazeera, 26 February 2024](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hamas-to-halal-how-anti-muslim-hate-speech-is-spreading-in-india#:~:text=The%20theories%20included%20%E2%80%9Clove%20jihad,Islamic%20practices%20as%20the%20economic) In Assam, where the BJP-ruled state government has forcibly evicted thousands of mainly Bengali Muslim families through anti-encroachment drives, a law against ‘land jihad’ found a place in the party’s official manifesto for the state assembly elections.[18](javascript:void(0))[Karishma Hasnat, ‘What is “land jihad”, and why BJP has promised a law against it in Assam election manifesto,’ The Print, 26 March 2021](https://theprint.in/politics/what-is-land-jihad-and-why-bjp-has-promised-a-law-against-it-in-assam-election-manifesto/628521/); [Rokibuz Zaman, ‘Why eviction drives in Assam are no longer facing resistance,’ Scroll (India), 30 December 2022](https://scroll.in/article/1040558/why-eviction-drives-in-assam-are-no-longer-facing-resistance) Perhaps unsurprisingly, the divisive rhetoric, combined with divisive policies, has polarized society along religious lines, triggering political violence in the form of riots between Hindu and Muslim mobs as well as violence targeting civilians from both religious groups ( _see graph below_). ACLED records over 210 clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the second term of the BJP government. The deadliest of these took place in February 2020 in the national capital of New Delhi, when more than 50 people, mainly Muslims, were reportedly killed in clashes over the CAA. Delhi Police, which falls under the direct control of the BJP-led central government, was accused of enabling the Hindu mobs that targeted Muslim localities.[19](javascript:void(0))[Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shaikh Azizur Rahman, ‘Delhi’s Muslims despair of justice after police implicated in riots,’ The Guardian, 16 March 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/delhis-muslims-despair-justice-police-implicated-hindu-riots) In the days preceding the violence, senior BJP leaders, including ministers, made several incendiary speeches labeling anti-CAA protesters as “traitors” and calling for them to be shot.[20](javascript:void(0))[Indian Express, ‘“Shoot the traitors” slogan raised at Union Minister Anurag Thakur’s rally, Delhi CEO seeks report,’ 28 January 2020](https://indianexpress.com/elections/delhi-in-election-rally-union-minister-anurag-thakur-leads-chants-of-shoot-the-traitors-6238005/) In addition, low-intensity clashes erupting around major Hindu religious festivals have now become normalized.[21](javascript:void(0))[Meenakshi Ganguly, ‘India’s Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence,’ Human Rights Watch, 5 April 2023](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/05/indias-hindu-festivals-bring-increasing-anti-muslim-violence) Such clashes are characterized by Hindu worshippers chanting provocative slogans and songs as their religious processions pass through Muslim localities. ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) Besides direct clashes between members of the two communities, ACLED data show that violence targeting civilians accounts for over half of all political violence between Hindus and Muslims. Over two-thirds of such violence has been carried out by Hindu mobs targeting Muslim civilians. Though motivations have varied, a large proportion of the violence in recent years has involved Hindus lynching Muslim civilians over suspicions of slaughtering cows or possessing beef ( _see graph below_) — a phenomenon known as ‘cow vigilantism.’ Cows are revered as sacred animals in Hinduism, prompting many states to enact laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows.[22](javascript:void(0))[Komal Deol, ‘Cow protection was a sensitive subject in India even when the Constitution was being framed,’ Scroll (India), 7 July 2021](https://scroll.in/article/998735/cow-protection-was-a-sensitive-subject-in-india-even-when-the-constitution-was-being-framed) Vigilante action has further polarized society, acting as a trigger for clashes between the two communities. In July 2023, Hindus and Muslims clashed in Haryana’s Nuh town amid rumors that a wanted cow vigilante would join a Hindu religious procession.[23](javascript:void(0))[BBC, ‘Monu Manesar: Cow vigilante wanted for Nuh violence arrested from Haryana,’ 12 September 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66783017) Besides cow vigilantism, ‘love jihad’ conspiracy theories were another major reason for violence targeting Muslims, with mainly Muslim men bearing the worst of it. The government — which has most often responded to such vigilantism with silence or even condonation — has done little to curb the violence.[24](javascript:void(0))[Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs, ‘Hindu Nationalism and the New Jim Crow,’ Journal of Democracy, January 2024](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hindu-nationalism-and-the-new-jim-crow/) ![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E) A more explicit example of state complicity in violence against Muslims is the phenomenon that has come to be known colloquially as ‘bulldozer justice,’ referring to the punitive demolition of the houses of perceived offenders under the guise of planning regulations.[25](javascript:void(0))[Biswajeet Banerjee, ‘Thousands Protest ‘Bulldozer Justice’ Against Indian Muslims,’ The Diplomat, 15 June 2022](https://thediplomat.com/2022/06/thousands-protest-bulldozer-justice-against-indian-muslims/) Such action, taken unilaterally by government authorities without following due process, has predominantly targeted Muslim homes after incidents of communal violence or activism by Muslims, prompting some to call it state-sanctioned collective punishment of the Muslim community.[26](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/); [Gautam Bhatia, ‘Demolitions as state-sanctioned collective punishment,’ The Hindu, 11 August 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demolitions-as-state-sanctioned-collective-punishment/article67180107.ece) A recent report by Amnesty International showed that in several instances, Hindu-owned properties located in the same vicinity were spared despite the involvement of both communities in the rioting, highlighting the discriminatory impact of the demolitions.[27](javascript:void(0))[Amnesty International, ‘India: “If you speak up, your house will be demolished”: Bulldozer injustice in India,’ 7 February 2024](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/7613/2024/en/) ACLED data show no less than 100 instances of so-called bulldozer justice being carried out since 2019, with the phenomenon only gathering pace over the years. Such events have been overwhelmingly centered in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh ( _see map below_), where BJP-led state governments have been in power since 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Ashley, ‘How the Spectre of Hindutva Captured Politics in Kerala,’ The Wire, 30 October 2020](https://thewire.in/politics/kerala-elections-hindutva-muslims) The BJP’s plans to make inroads in these states have also increased tensions with opposition parties dominant there, further prompting violence. Meanwhile, the government’s unequivocal embrace of Hindu nationalism has heralded a shift in Indian society, moving the political discourse firmly to the right with regard to religion. Several members of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of around 20 opposition parties led by the progressive INC, now follow what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva.’ This involves endorsing some of the more moderate demands of Hindu nationalism and practicing a more performative Hinduism, in the hopes of clawing back some Hindu voters from the BJP.[35](javascript:void(0))[Ajay K Mehra, ‘Divided Cadre, Soft Hindutva and Other Factors That Don’t Help the Congress,’ The Wire, 8 December 2023](https://thewire.in/politics/congress-narrative-polls-bjp-hindutva); [Abhik Bhattacharya, ‘Changing Turf: Is AAP Peddling With Soft Hindutva?,’ Outlook, 22 May 2023](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/changing-turf-magazine-287788) The strategy has so far proven to be relatively unsuccessful, as the BJP continues to dominate the electoral landscape. A victory for the BJP in the upcoming general elections, as is the most likely outcome, will only strengthen the Hindu nationalist movement.

Also in the works is a ‘Uniform Civil Code,’ through which a common law governing civil relations would replace the existing system, where respective religious laws govern relations among members of the same community. Minorities, including Muslims, fear that a common law would curtail their rights to freedom of religion and culture.[37](javascript:void(0))[Sonia Sarkar, ‘Will Modi’s Uniform Civil Code kill Indian “secularism”?,’ Al Jazeera, 17 August 2023](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/8/17/will-a-uniform-civil-code-end-indian-secularism) For its part, the BJP maintains that the CAA is primarily a humanitarian gesture intended to benefit those facing religious persecution abroad and would not impact the citizenship of Muslims born in India, while a uniform civil code would further gender equality by eliminating “regressive” personal laws.[38](javascript:void(0))[Sheikh Saaliq, ‘India’s new citizenship law excludes Muslims.

India’s vulnerability to floods, cyclones, and earthquakes significantly impacts industrialized regions like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. Building resilience through risk assessment, hotspot identification, and reinsurance solutions is crucial for long-term sustainability.

These states also face increased risks: - **Gujarat**: Prone to floods, tropical cyclones and earthquakes. - **Maharashtra**: Prone to floods and cyclones especially in Mumbai. - **Tamil Nadu:** Regularly affected by monsoon floods and cyclones especially in Chennai. ### **Earthquake risks** - Urban centers such as **Delhi and Ahmedabad face** significant earthquake hazards. - A **large earthquake in the Himalayas or near urban centers** such as Mumbai could lead to catastrophic losses, potentially surpassing the devastation caused by the 2001 Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat. ### **Challenges** | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Impact** | **Description** | **Examples** | | **Loss of Life and Property** | Significant loss of human, agricultural, and animal life in densely populated areas. | Disasters in densely populated regions. | | **Economic Losses** | Destruction of infrastructure burdens the national exchequer and disrupts economic activities like tourism. | Uninsured economic losses in India: $32.94 billion (2018–2022, Swiss Re). | | **Disruption of Business** | Disasters disrupt transport, communication, and public services. Companies often lack IT disaster recovery plans. | Service and infrastructure disruptions. | | **Environmental Losses** | Loss of natural resources, biodiversity, and habitat destruction due to events like forest fires, landslides, and cyclones. | Forest fires in Uttarakhand and the Amazon (2019–2020). Landslides affecting habitats. | | **Health Effects** | Disasters cause health issues such as radiation syndrome, and neurological disorders, and contribute to poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. | Impact of nuclear accidents and oil spills. | ### **Costliest floods** - **Mumbai floods (2005):** Losses of $5.3 billion - **Chennai floods (2015):** $6.6 billion in losses ### **Building Resilience** | | | | --- | --- | | **Step** | **Description** | | **Hotspot Identification** | Identify high-risk regions like Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Chennai using detailed data for targeted mitigation. | | **Risk Assessment** | Use advanced models with current data to accurately assess potential exposure and risk accumulation. | | **Providing a Solution** | Design reinsurance programs to address protection gaps and promote affordable insurance options. | ### **Conclusion** Investing in disaster preparedness, risk management and building resilience is not just a matter of protecting lives and livelihoods in the short term, but is also critical to ensuring the long-term sustainability and prosperity of communities in an increasingly uncertain world. **READ ABOUT** **[The Impact Of Disasters On Agriculture And Food Security](https://www.iasgyan.in/daily-current-affairs/the-impact-of-disasters-on-agriculture-and-food-security)** **Source:** **[https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-economic-losses-natural-catastrophes-9779008/)** | | | --- | | **PRACTICE QUESTION** 1. **Examine the major natural catastrophe risks faced by India and assess their economic impacts on various sectors.

To try to keep the peace, Beijing and New Delhi began a dialogue in 2003 called the Special Representatives Meeting on the India-China Boundary Question. Yet 19 rounds of talks later, China and India still disagree on the location of the border between them -- and over which side rightfully controls the territories of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.

(AFP via Getty Images) Back-to-back explosions in New Delhi and Islamabad appear unlikely to trigger imminent Indian or Pakistani retaliation against the other, but severe bilateral mistrust and tensions will sustain the risk of renewed cross-border strikes against targets in major cities should either country determine the other culpable for the recent blasts. On Nov. 11, a suicide bombing killed at least 12 people and injured 36 outside the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. While the Afghanistan-based Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group denied responsibility, a hard-line TTP faction, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), subsequently claimed the attack and said it targeted \"the judges, lawyers, and other staff who enforce Pakistan's un-Islamic laws.\" Pakistani authorities are still investigating \"all aspects\" of the bombing, though some top officials have suggested it occurred with Indian support, with Pakistan's prime minister attributing the attack to India-backed militants, and the country's interior minister claiming \"Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" were... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

These areas include defense technology cooperation, the discussion of a framework for military-to-military agreements, and the expansion of joint military exercises. U.S.-India defense cooperation, however, will remain limited in critical areas where India’s historical independent interests remain firm. Among these areas of Indian reserve include strategic autonomy, the imperatives of domestic federalism, and the preference for a go-slow approach toward redressing civil unrest. Attempts by U.S. policymakers to press harder in these areas will likely prove counterproductive. ## Document Type Book ## Publication Date 10-2016 ## Publisher National Defense University Press ## City Washington, DC ## Recommended Citation Lynch, Thomas F.

    "full_text": "# Thailand As Thailand’s knowledge and creative economies grow, it’s likely to find itself confronted with an increasing number of incidents of IP theft and cyberattacks. The Thai Government must focus more on proactive risk mitigation to protect its national proprietary assets and security. While Thailand has seen rapid development of its cybersecurity governance in the past few years, including with the establishment of a national cyber agency, little attention has been paid to cyber-related threats to innovation. ASPI assesses Thailand to be Moderately vulnerable to state-sponsored acts of cyber-enabled theft of IP. ### Author Dr. Jessada Burinsuchat [Wat Arun Ratchawararam 005](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/0000140_-_Wat_Arun_Ratchawararam_005.jpg) \\- [Preecha.MJ](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Preecha.MJ) ## Key Facts ### R&D Investments USD $5.8 billion (2019) ### Patent Applications 3,818 (2017) ### Cybersecurity Agency National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) How at risk is Thailand Thailand’s ambitious 20-year development strategy and “Thailand 4.0” vision, focusing on transforming key industries through science, technology, and innovation, place it at risk of cyber-enabled IP theft. The country’s growing digital economy, increasing foreign direct investment in ICT and manufacturing, and government incentives for R&D in strategic sectors make it an attractive target for state-sponsored actors seeking to steal valuable intellectual property and economic information. Since 2018, Thailand has actively pursued a 20-year development strategy to extend its knowledge economy. The strategy, which has been adopted into legislation, [focuses](http://nscr.nesdb.go.th/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/National-Strategy-Eng-Final-25-OCT-2019.pdf.) on developing various types of capital, including human, intellectual, financial, mechanised, social and natural resources. As part of the strategy, Thailand has also [unleashed](https://www.industry.go.th/web-upload/1xff0d34e409a13ef56eea54c52a291126/m_magazine/12668/373/file_download/b29e16008a87c72b354efebef853a428.pdf) a vision of ‘Thailand 4.0’ to transform Thailand into a value-based economy built on science, technology and innovation. Overall, Thailand’s knowledge sector is seeing modest signs of development. Thailand’s patent applications have hovered around 1,400 to 1,900 per year. Patent approval rates have remained low as Thailand faces issues with extensive backlogs and long delays in IP registration. In 2018, WIPO reported that Thailand’s success rate in granting patents was only 14%. Thailand’s foreign and economic policy is driven by pragmatism, as the government seeks to secure economic gains for national development. Thailand also maintains healthy economic and scientific ties with Japan and the US. Both were the biggest investors among OECD countries from 2020 to 2022. Thailand also maintains strong economic ties with China. A part of the relationship focuses on technology investments and technology transfers from China to Thailand. The economic relationship has included strong collaboration in science and technology, and Chinese firms have invested in Thailand’s 5G infrastructure and the broader connectivity ecosystem, including railways. While the two states maintain a bilateral IP agreement, the focus of the agreement is on capacity building. For instance, China has helped to cultivate engineering talent for high-speed railways in Thailand. Overall, Thailand’s relationship with China is quite comprehensive, touching on economics, technology transfers and scientific cooperation. How prepared is Thailand Thailand maintains modest defences to combat the threat of cyber-enabled IP theft. Broadly, cybersecurity in Thailand has struggled to keep pace with economic development and the digital transformation. While there’s better awareness in cyber-dependent sectors, the overall population lacks digital literacy and cybersecurity knowledge, leading to a very high number of cybercrime victims. The banking sector, in particular, has established cybersecurity measures, and government and businesses have invested more in awareness building. The National Cyber Security Agency (established in 2011), Office of the Personal Data Protection Committee, and the Royal Thai Police play significant roles in regulating and enforcing cybersecurity and combating cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. The country participates in international agreements and norms related to cybersecurity, seeking bilateral cooperation while balancing relationships with major powers and multilateral cooperation. Thailand hasn’t ratified the Budapest Convention, but it complies with its principles through the Computer Crime Act. Thailand is currently playing an active role in the UN’s Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of ICTs for Criminal Purposes. Overall, Thailand’s posture on international norms on state behaviour in cyberspace has been reactive, though it does comply with most international standards. Thailand has been working to improve IP protection and enforcement to address IP theft. IP governance has almost all the necessary policy frameworks and organisational structures in place. A subcommittee on IP rights enforcement was set up in 2016 to bring 16 government agencies as well as industry groups together to promote IP protection and counter IP violations. In 2017, the Department of Intellectual Property formed a multiagency centre, called Intellectual Property Enforcement, which includes 39 agencies, such as the Internal Security Operations Command, the Royal Thai Police and other public and private agencies to crack down on markets that violate IP laws. Amendments to the Computer Crime Act 2007 in 2017 and additional measures in the Copyright Act now enable internet service providers and commercial service platforms to take down infringing content. There’s a growing culture of IP protection in Thailand, and the country moved up in the US’s Special 301 Report from the Priority Watch List to the Watch List tier in 2017. Efficiency in implementation and enforcement is the biggest stumbling block, in large part due to bureaucratic mechanisms. Altogether, the country’s participation in international IP agreements reflects its commitment to IP protection, but it’s considered a follower rather than a leading actor in the international IP protection agenda. # **Reported cases of economic cyber-espionage** ### Name of Incident ### Victims (entities) ### Sectors Affected ### Affected economies ### Threat Actor ### Alleged state sponsor ### Date reported Operation Cloud Hopper (APT10) Customers or providers of Managed Services / Enterprise Service / Cloud Services, manufacturing companies in India, Japan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service providers worldwide. Computer System Design and Related Services, Telecommunications, Mining Australia, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, UK APT10 China 2017 ### Context Operation Cloud Hopper is one of the largest sustained global cyber espionage campaigns. The operation has been traced back to at least 2016 and has targeted managed IT service providers, thus acquiring potentially unprecedented access to IP and sensitive data of those MSPs as well as their clients across the globe. Some of these targets compromised include Fujitsu, Tata Consultancy Services, NTT Data, Dimension Data, Computer Sciences Corporation, DXC Technology, Ericsson, and IBM (see Operation Cloud Hopper). A wide range of sectors were affected, ranging from telecommunications to mining. The suspected targets of these operations were those that aligned with China’s national security and “Made in China” goals, focused primarily on valuable military and intelligence information as well as confidential business data. PwC, in cooperation with BAE Systems and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, attributed the attacks to APT10, a China-based hacking group. Symantec, similarly, found an advanced persistent threat campaign targeting companies in multiple sectors across 17 regions in Japan. This campaign was also attributed to Cloud Hopper (which they called Cicada).Several countries, including the US and Australia, attributed Operation Cloud Hopper to a hacking group that has backing from the Chinese state. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Intellectual property, possibly worth billons of dollars ### Attribution [PwC](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html), [Symantec](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage), Governments of US, UK, New Zealand, and Australia ### Governments' response The U.S. Government held the Chinese government accountable for these campaigns, including [indicting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion) suspected hackers.

Emissary Panda may also be connected to several other PRC-sponsored APTs, including Emmisary Panda, APT27, and Luckymouse 2018 ### Context Dubbed “Operation Pzchao” by Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, this cyber campaign targeted government institutions, as well as private firms in the technology, education, and telecommunications sector that are primarily based in the U.S., though with also some cases in several other countries. Bitdefender attributed the attack to Emmisary Panda, a China-based threat group active since 2010. The group has been suspected of conducting [espionage](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/mustang-panda) operations on civil society organisations and governments deemed critical of the PRC, including advocacy organisations on Taiwan and Tibetan independence. While this threat group’s focus has traditionally been on political espionage, we suspect – with moderate confidence¬ – that this attack had possible economic objectives as well. Initiated in July 2017, this cyber incident came against the backdrop of developments in China’s technology and telecommunications sector, including Beijing [laying out](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/china-artificial-intelligence.html) a development plan to become the world leader in AI by 2030. The Iron Tiger APT (aka Panda Emissary or TG-3390) is active at least since 2010 and targeted organization in APAC, but since 2013 it is attacking high-technology targets in the US. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Unknown ### Attribution [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/185/Bitdefender-Business-2017-WhitePaper-PZCHAO-crea2452-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf) ### Governments' response None ### Sources ### Level of confidence **Moderate Confidence** **(7 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - No clear information if commercial data is targeted (1 point) - APT actor has some history of stealing IP and other commercially valuable data (2 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, USA and Vietnam Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) Ocean Lotus Campaign (APT32) 2017 ### Context In 2017, FireEye announced that they have observed APT32 conducting cyberespionage operations targeting foreign companies with a vested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors. The campaign has gone about since 2013. There are indicators that APT32 actors are targeting peripheral network security and technological infrastructure corporations.

These campaigns were conducted in three clusters. First, from January to March 2020, there was a broad campaign against 75 private entities in 20 countries, with a focus on industries ranging from petrochemicals to defense industrial base. Mandiant notes that while it’s unclear if APT41 scanned the Internet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, the victims appear to be more targeted in nature. The economies affected were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA. Second, in September 2020, hackers associated with APT41 were [charged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with computer intrusion campaigns against more than 100 victims globally, including in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The entities affected were those that specialize in software development, manufacturers, telecommunications, non-profit, universities, and civil society organizations. Third, from July 2020 until August 2021 (ongoing as of then), Trend Micro observed an espionage campaign against victims in India, m, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam in the airline, computer hardware, automotive, infrastructure, publishing, media, and IT industries. ### Economic objectives ### Assets stolen Sensitive business information, source codes, software codes signing certificates, and customer account data ### Attribution US Government, [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits); [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/apt41-resurfaces-as-earth-baku-with-new-cyberespionage-campaign.html) ### Governments' response In second incident, U.S. Department of Justice [indicts](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) seven individuals (two arrested, five remaining) ### Sources ### Level of confidence **High Confidence (9 out of 12)** - Private entities are a majority of known sectors targeted in the intrusion (2 points) - Commercial data are likely to have been targeted (2 points) - APT actor is strongly associated with economic espionage operations, with motivations strongly tied to certain states’ industrial policy objectives (3 points) - No concrete evidence that data stolen was used to aid domestic private businesses of malign state, but data stolen likely aligns with malign state’s industrial policies (2 points) ### Office 40 Macquarie StreetBarton ACT 2600 ### Contact Ph: +61 2 6270 5100 [E: enquiries@aspi.org.au](mailto:hello@aspi.com) ### Explore [Home](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au) [About](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/about) [Country Profiles](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/country-profiles) [Insights](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/insight) [Media](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/media) [Case Repository](https://www.cybersecureip.aspi.org.au/case-repository) © 2025 ASPI.

The ceasefire so far appears to be broadly holding (albeit tenuously), with clashes easing along the disputed India-Pakistan border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control. Much remains unclear about the circumstances surrounding the truce, including the precise role international pressure played in bringing it about.

Both in the days before the ceremony and since, India has seen a surge in violence against minorities—often fueled by Hindu nationalists— [spread across](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-temple-consecration-violent-incidents-occur-in-at-least-6-states) several states. Reported incidents have spanned from sandals being thrown inside a mosque and a shop being set ablaze in Telangana state, to more serious incidents like a graveyard being vandalized and set on fire in Bihar. The inauguration of the temple holds particular political significance, presenting an opportunity for Modi to bolster his popularity among voters in India, a nation of 1.4 billion people, before elections later this year. But since the temple now stands where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992, critics say Modi’s participation exacerbated the long-standing tensions between India’s Hindu majority and its religious minorities, particularly Muslims. One day before the temple consecration, a group of individuals chanting “Jai Shri Ram”—“Glory to Lord Rama”— [scaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9nYZ-1eJag) a Christian church in the town of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They hoisted a saffron flag—a symbol of Indian independence movements in the 20th century and used today by a nationalist paramilitary group—atop a cross, with an image of the Ayodhya Ram temple and the inscription “Jai Shri Ram.” On the day of the temple consecration, a 19-year-old Muslim man was [assaulted](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/telangana-muslim-teen-paraded-naked-during-ram-temple-celebrations-sent-to-jail/) and paraded naked by a mob of Hindu nationalists celebrating Ayodhya’s Ram temple consecration at Margi, Telangana. A day later, the state government in Maharashtra [razed](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/mumbai-bulldozers-reach-mohammed-ali-road-too-razing-40-structures-opp-calls-bjps-message-to-muslims/) about 40 shops owned by Muslims. The demolitions were carried out in the same area where violent Hindu nationalists celebrating the Ram temple inauguration confronted Muslims days before. On January 29, in Balrampur, Chhattisgarh, members of the Hindu Mahasabha, a nationalist political party, disrupted a Christian gathering based on false [allegations](https://organiser.org/2024/02/01/219480/bharat/chhattisgarh-five-detained-for-allegedly-luring-people-in-embracing-christianity-in-balrampur/) of religious conversions. On January 30, officials from the Delhi Development Authority, accompanied by police, [demolished](https://www.siasat.com/delhi-authorities-raze-600-year-old-mosque-without-prior-notice-2968546/) a 600-year-old mosque in South Delhi without providing prior notice. The mosque was razed and debris cleared before worshippers could gather for the pre-dawn prayers. As he arrived during the demolition, the mosque’s imam was denied entry and had his phone confiscated to prevent him from contacting others. A small school for Muslim children was also destroyed, and a graveyard next to the mosque dug up. A group of 22 Indian diaspora organizations [released](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-inauguration-sets-dangerous-precedent-for-minorities-in-india-warns-diaspora-groups/) a joint statement drawing a straight line between Modi’s Hindu nationalism and the recent violence. “This is happening against a backdrop of a horrifying escalation in discrimination and violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and is against the secular fabric of the country and its Constitution,” they said. They also condemned Modi’s presence at the temple consecration, which they said signals Modi’s intent to “sideline and replace India’s secular Constitution.” Both Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have championed [Hindutva](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/7/us-academic-conference-dismantling-global-hindutva-hindu-right-wing-groups), the political ideology that prioritizes the interests and identity of Hindus in India and seeks to promote a sense of cultural and national unity among Hindus and asserts the primacy of Hindu culture and values in Indian society. Modi’s political worldview has put him in conflict with the Indian Constitution, established in 1950, which emphasizes secularism, democracy and equality for all citizens. Policies such as the [Citizen Amendment Act](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)—which opens up pathways to Indian citizenship for refugee groups with the exclusion of Muslims—and Modi’s 2019 move to [revoke the autonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-historic-shift-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-status-explained/article67635628.ece) of Indian administered Kashmir have both been met with criticism. Since he assumed office in 2014, Modi’s tenure has seen concurrent mass events of communal violence [targeting](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-09) Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities, and a [sharp decline in press freedom](https://thewire.in/media/rsf-press-freedom-index-india). He enjoys the support of the Hindu majority, boasting an [approval rating of 76 percent](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-approval-rating-of-76-narendra-modi-most-popular-global-leader-morning-consult/articleshow/105849567.cms?from=mdr), which positions him as the most popular leader globally, according to data from the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His influence among world leaders [also seems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/21/india-modi-biden-china/) to be rising, as does the reach of [Hindutva](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/moynihan-institute-of-global-affairs/events/2021/09/11/default-calendar/dismantling-global-hindutva). In New York last month, Indians who sympathize with Modi’s far-right Hindu populism [chanted](https://twitter.com/HindutvaWatchIn/status/1749269469094940875) slogans calling for the takeover of two more mosques in the Indian cities of Mathura and Varanasi. “Ayodhya is just a teaser,” the crowd chanted. “Kashi and Mathura are pending!” “The recent widespread festivities in the United States are concerning,” Rasheed Ahmed, who heads the Indian American Muslim Council, [said](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections). “The celebration of Ram temple consecration and glorification of Babri masjid demolition on a global scale is a blatant endorsement of religious intolerance.” Modi’s involvement at the temple consecration in Ayodhya lends significant weight to the event, “which heightened the emotions, inflaming existing animosity among the Hindutva believers,” said Sudeep Dalvi, a social activist based in Goa, India. “For decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Modi has been strongly advocating for the construction of the temple, viewing it as a symbolic assertion of Hindu identity following centuries of Mughal and British rule,” he said. The site of the temple has been a flashpoint for religious tensions for decades, particularly since the demolition of the 460-year-old [Babri Masjid mosque](https://www.britannica.com/place/Babri-Masjid) in 1992 by a large mob of more than 150,000 Hindutva men and women. In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the mosque site should be handed over to a trust for the construction of a Hindu temple. The central government's announcement of a half-day closure for numerous hospitals, government offices, central institutions, and businesses across the country on the day of the consecration raised concerns about potential disruptions to emergency services nationwide and received harsh [criticism](https://maktoobmedia.com/india/ram-temple-event-aiims-delhi-to-be-closed-till-230-pm-on-22-january-draws-criticism/). Criticism for Modi also came from international organizations, opposition parties, and prominent spiritual leaders following the ceremony. Four shankaracharyas—revered spiritual leaders of the Hindu faith— [did not attend](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/unveiling-the-role-of-shankaracharyas-625231.html) the ceremony, unhappy with what they perceive as a departure from the ancient Hindu tradition. “It’s the responsibility of priests and sadhus to consecrate Lord Rama’s idol,” [said](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wont-attend-ram-temple-event-says-shankaracharya-nishchalananda/articleshow/106606358.cms) Shankaracharya Nishchalananda. They also viewed the ceremony as overly politicized, potentially influenced by electoral considerations. The Congress Party, the chief rival to Modi’s BJP, asserted in a [statement](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/1/22/modi-hails-a-divine-india-as-he-opens-controversial-hindu-temple-ahead-of-national-elections) that while religion is a personal matter, the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer paramilitary organization, have long pursued the construction of the Ram Mandir as a political project. Modi is a lifelong member of the all-male RSS, which was established in 1925 and [modeled](https://ullekhnp.com/2023/09/11/rsss-militant-structure-is-modelled-on-mussolinis-blackshirts-marzia-casolari/) on Italian fascist groups such as Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Both the BJP and RSS view India as a nation for Hindus, by Hindus. Before assuming office as India’s prime minister in 2014, Modi served as the chief minister of Gujarat state, which in 2002 experienced a riot resulting in more than 2,000 deaths, predominantly among the Muslim community.\\* A United Kingdom [inquiry](https://thewire.in/communalism/bbc-documentary-gujarat-riots-modi-directly-responsible) later declared Modi was “directly responsible.” This dark chapter netted Modi international condemnation, including a U.S. [travel ban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010) in 2005, and cemented his image at home as an anti-Muslim leader. Despite the rising Hindu nationalist violence against Indian Muslims during his tenure as a chief minister, Modi led the BJP to victory in the 2014 general elections and secured another win in 2019. Now, with the inauguration of the temple, Modi and the BJP are aiming to leverage religious sentiments to shore up their grip on power for a third consecutive term in the upcoming elections, expected to take place this spring. Modi aims to position himself as a leader who honors and promotes Hindutva and Hindu heritage, appealing to a broad spectrum of voters across the Hindu majority in India. “The temple’s opening not only marks a milestone in the BJP’s Hindutva agenda but resonates deeply with Hindu sentiments, potentially solidifying support for the party among its base,” Dalvi said. _**Correction, February 4, 2024:** The Gujarat riots referenced in this article were in 2002, not 2022._ [Shadab Farooq](https://thedispatch.com/author/shadab-farooq) Shadab Farooq is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, India, covering religion, politics, the environment, and culture.

Reports from STRATFOR sources in the area do not indicate a substantial PLA presence in the area. However, they have confirmed an increase in Chinese laborers and army engineers deployed to the area to assist in flood relief operations and expand the Karakoram Highway, which links China's Xinjiang province to Chinese-funded ports on the Arabian Sea via Pakistan's road and railway network. Though the reports of Chinese troop infiltration into Kashmir appear to be greatly exaggerated, China's reassertion of territorial claims, coupled with its support for Pakistan, is contributory to U.S.-Indian defense cooperation in the Indian Ocean basin. This trend, along with U.S. patience in Afghanistan wearing thin, will compel Pakistan to rely more heavily on Chinese support against India. ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2025 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

(TAUSEEF MUSTAFA/AFP via Getty Images) Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strong condemnation of Chinese actions at the Line of Actual (LAC) control, India is poised for a significant strategy shift in how it manages its contested border with China. The June 15 clash in the long-disputed territory of Ladakh, which marked the first time Indian troops have died at the hands of Chinese forces since 1975, has highlighted India's failure to dissuade China from attempting to permanently alter the balance of power along the border via diplomatic and confidence-building measures. This has left New Delhi more likely to pursue more confrontational options, which will undoubtedly have its risks, though India's battle-tested military may find such an escalation to its short-term advantage. ...

(ANNIRUDHA MOOKERJEE/AFP/Getty Images) For more than two months, Chinese and Indian forces have stood toe to toe on the Doklam Plateau. The standoff is just the latest manifestation of a border dispute that began long before Chinese soldiers tried to extend a road through the contested region June 16 -- and one that extends well past the area in question. Along the thousands of kilometers of sinuous border between China and India lie three main points of contention: Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The regions are the most likely sites of a military confrontation between China and India, and each presents its own set of strategic considerations....

(AHMAD SAHEL ARMAN/AFP via Getty Images) By improving ties with the Taliban, India is seeking to reduce security risks, counterbalance Pakistan’s influence and improve economic opportunities in Afghanistan. But this strategy is likely to achieve only modest results because of Afghanistan’s fragile economic and security environment, as well as New Delhi’s enduring ideological and cultural differences with the Taliban. Indian officials recently visited Afghanistan for the first time since the Taliban took control of the country last year. A delegation led by J.P. Singh -- a secretary overseeing India’s external affairs with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran -- traveled to Kabul on June 6 to discuss the delivery of humanitarian aid with Taliban leaders. With the exception of sending such aid and indirectly contacting Afghanistan through third countries, New Delhi had not established a formal dialogue with Kabul since the Taliban seized power in August 2021. The diplomatic visit reflects India’s new policy of engagement with the...

(R.SATISH BABU/AFP via Getty Images) India's enactment of a controversial citizenship law will likely heighten political polarization ahead of the April-May general elections, raise concerns over religious discrimination, and trigger protests and high risks of violent clashes. Sporadic protests have broken out in various parts of India after the government on March 11 issued the rules for implementing its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which will streamline the process of granting citizenship to some undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The main protests took place in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the northeastern state of Assam, and parts of the capital New Delhi. Protesters in Tamil Nadu's capital of Chennai marched and shouted their opposition to the bill, which has been criticized as being discriminatory against Muslims. Protesters in Assam also burnt copies of the law, while protests and tensions at New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University triggered the deployment of security forces...

_The government of Iran has shut off access to the internet in most of the country amid recent protests, a tactic also used to control civil unrest in India, Ethiopia, Iraq and Sudan._ - _Such restrictions are aimed at preventing protesters from organizing, halting the spread of misinformation, quelling communal violence and even obstructing communications among coup plotters._ - _Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks._ Amid the recent bout of nationwide protests in Iran, government-enforced blackouts have taken more than 90 percent of the country's internet offline and blocked most Iranians from communicating with the outside world. The move has drawn substantial international media attention, and #Internet4Iran has been a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. Tehran blocked the internet during protests in late 2017 and early 2018, but the scale of the current blackouts is unprecedented in Iran. Governments are likely to continue to use internet blackouts for the foreseeable future, especially as they gain more control over internet and mobile networks....

In the Rose Garden of the White House, as part of his Liberation Day announcement event, Trump repeatedly referred to “reciprocal tariffs”. This announcement has snowballed into a full-blown trade war between the US and China after Trump imposed renewed tariffs of over 100 per cent on Chinese goods imports. Beijing warned that it was ready for a prolonged trade war with the US while calling Trump’s decisions “unilateral”. For [India](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/trump-us-tariffs-india-trade-deal-2025/article69412081.ece), the Trump administration enforced 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs, causing a widespread stock market collapse and anxieties regarding the future of bilateral trade and the overall health of the economy. On April 9 the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from New Delhi came into full effect. What does the US decision to increase tariff on Indian goods entail? _Frontline_ spoke to Michael Kugelman, one of the leading analysts of South Asia with particular focus on India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and their relations with the US, to understand the impact of Trump’s tariffs on South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. Excerpts: Is there a case for New Delhi to gain from US tariffs and work on economic reforms and liberalisation or will Trump’s decision cause a ripple effect on India’s economy? For India, if there’s ever been a moment to accelerate trade liberalisation, it’s now, with New Delhi feeling the heat of the new US tariffs and knowing that its trade deficit with the US in India’s favour is driving this aggressive US policy. And it’s not like trade reform would be a drastic change or a heavy lift for India. We’ve already seen it ease up on protectionism in recent years: Just look at the new FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) it’s concluded, in Australia and in the Gulf and likely soon in the EU. That said, the pressure to reform and liberalise more will amplify an awkward political dilemma: Some of the most heavily protested industries in India are the politically important. Here, agriculture stands out. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a rare policy reversal when he pulled back new agricultural liberalisation laws, following large-scale [farmers’ protests](https://frontline.thehindu.com/farmers-struggle/package-farmers-protests-all-you-wanted-to-know/article67852851.ece). These political factors will be the big obstacle as New Delhi navigates Trump’s tariff pressures. Despite the bonhomie between Trump and Modi, the former has unleashed 26 per cent “reciprocal tariffs” on New Delhi’s exports to the US. Will this instigate a bilateral trade dispute between the two “friendly” countries or pave the way for an amicable solution and negotiations? There won’t be a trade dispute. India is in that category of nations, which includes other growing economies in the Indo Pacific, that won’t retaliate and will instead try to negotiate for better outcomes. This has been Delhi’s playbook from the start: Talk, offer, and concede. From day one of the current administration, Delhi has offered to lower tariffs and increase imports, and it’s done so. It’s also held a series of high-level talks with the US. India does have a luxury that few countries enjoy at the moment: A commitment from the US to pursue a trade deal meant to reduce tariffs and increase market access. For India, getting to “yes” will be essential, as this will be the best way to blunt the effect of the new tariffs. The clock is ticking though, as the US wants this to be a comprehensive deal, and a first phase agreement is being targeted for the fall \\[autumn\\]. **Also Read \\| [Global shockwaves are back, thanks to tariffs and tantrums](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/global-tariff-war-trump-india-response-modi/article69430428.ece)** Some economic experts argue that India’s economy is more “inward looking” and “resilient” and therefore won’t be as adversely impacted as other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance. Other experts are of the view that India’s GDP growth rate faces risks from the Trump tariff shock. Which scenario do you believe is more likely? Given the size of India’s economy, its successful export diversification strategy, and its wide array of trade partners, it will avoid the worst possible outcomes. It also helps that several of its key products were exempted from tariffs. Still, even if 26 per cent tariffs are lower than the levies slammed on its less economically strong neighbours, that’s still a shock to the system, and especially in a country where there’s been concern of late about sluggish growth in key sectors such as manufacturing. “The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others \\[Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\\]. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack.”Michael Kugelman Author and analyst of South Asia. Let’s come to the much spoken about “personal bond” between Trump and Modi. Can the duo navigate the current crisis or is the challenge beyond personal bonhomie, and a case of each country’s economic interest? Personal relationships are important to Trump, and as I understand it, there is genuine [affinity between the two leaders](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-foreign-policy-nehru-vs-modi-non-alignment-to-multi-alignment-trump-tariff-war/article69426090.ece) and a lot of strong chemistry. It’s also helpful that Trump met Modi some weeks ago so that he could be reminded of the strength of that personal partnership. That said, personality factors alone aren’t enough to shield India. Trump has often spoken of his respect for Modi, but he has also repeatedly railed against India’s tariff policies. The bonhomie between the two men might have helped forestall worse tariff outcomes, but India was still dealt a blow. And if we’re looking for other reasons why India wasn’t hit hard by tariffs, one can perhaps look at the fact that its trade deficit with the US, while high, is much lower than many other countries that were hit a lot harder. Shifting focus to India’s neighbours—particularly Pakistan (29 per cent) and Bangladesh (37 per cent)—why are US tariffs so high on these two countries? You also make a point about diversifying the market. Is this an area of concern for Pakistan and Bangladesh? Here, we have to look at the range of factors that determined what levels of tariffs were imposed on different countries. Trade deficits were a key factor, though India’s deficit figure with the US is much higher than that of [Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka](https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/frontline-on-air-audio-story-india-in-the-south-asian-neighbourhood-friendship-or-friction/article67828893.ece): All three, especially Sri Lanka, were served with much higher tariffs. So, another key criterion to look at is tariffs that these countries charge to the US. According to Trump administration figures, which have been disputed by many observers, these three countries all slap higher rates on the US than does India. And of course, geopolitics always plays a role. The US views India as a much more critical partner than it does the others. So, naturally, it may want to cut it some slack. _Gowhar Geelani is a senior journalist and author of_ Kashmir: Rage and Reason. ## Featured Comment CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS [GET OUR NEWSLETTERS](https://frontline.thehindu.com/newsletter-subscription/?&utm_source=article_page&utm_medium=article_footer) - Copy link - [Email](mailto://frontline.thehindu.com?&subject=Subject line: Frontline - India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman&body=Mail%20content:%0D%0A%0D%0ACheck%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Frontline%20Magazine%20-%20Article%20%0D%0ATitle:%20India%20was%20still%20dealt%20a%20blow%3A%C2%A0Michael%20Kugelman%0D%0A%0D%0ADescription:%20The%20South%20Asia%20analyst%20says%20even%20Modi%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Crapport%E2%80%9D%20with%20Trump%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20shield%20India%20from%20the%20tariff%20storm%2C%20which%20has%20exposed%20its%20trade%20vulnerabilities.%0D%0A%0D%0ARead%20here%20->%20https%3A%2F%2Ffrontline.thehindu.com%2Finterviews%2Ftrump-india-tariffs-2025-us-trade-war-south-asia-impact%2Farticle69433903.ece%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Darticle_share) - Facebook - Twitter - Telegram - LinkedIn - WhatsApp - Reddit ## Stories that help you connect the dots ### [India’s new trade gamble](https://frontline.thehindu.com/columns/india-trade-liberalisation-modi-free-trade-policy-trump-usa-tariffs/article69333309.ece?utm_source=relatedstories&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=trackRelArt) [India is pursuing fresh free trade agreements under US pressure.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The restructuring of USAID and reductions in U.S. foreign aid will disrupt humanitarian and development programs across the world, which could worsen global health outcomes, destabilize security environments, accelerate democratic backsliding and create opportunities for rival powers to expand their influence. Efforts by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to restructure the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. government's humanitarian aid agency, accelerated on Feb. 3 after more than a thousand USAID contractors, many from the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, lost access overnight to the agency's systems. Later the same day, after signage was removed from USAID's headquarters in Washington D.C. and its official government website was taken down, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was stepping in as acting administrator for USAID and notified Congress of the agency's ''potential reorganization.'' U.S. officials reported that USAID would be incorporated under the U.S. State Department,...

I agree with that assessment, given the onslaught of major ransomware attacks we’ve seen this year. But it’s also important to note that there’s been meaningful progress in U.N. negotiations on cyberspace -- much to the surprise of many observers, including myself. In March, the Russia-backed Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) reached a cybersecurity agreement reaffirming 11 non-binding norms for state-sponsored cyber activity. And then two months later, the U.S.-backed Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) followed suit. That said, fundamental differences in opinions and priorities between countries remain on what kind of cyber activities should be regulated and how.

The devastating surge of the coronavirus in India has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It has also threatened its recovery from last year's deep recession and could set back development and poverty reduction efforts for years to come. India also faces a complex set of terror threats that are spread out across the country's diverse geography, originate from a variety of ideologies and rely on widely different tactics. **Further Reading From Stratfor Worldview:** [A COVID-19 Surge Sets Back India's Economy](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/covid-19-surge-sets-back-india-s-economy) [Elections Outside India's Hindi Heartland Will Test the BJP's Reach](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/elections-outside-india-s-hindi-heartland-will-test-bjp-s-reach) **More From Stratfor:** [Follow Stratfor on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stratfor) [Find Stratfor on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stratfor) [Connect with Stratfor on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratfor/) ## Sign Up for the Free Stratfor Worldview Newsletter from RANE [Sign up today to receive special offers, a weekly newsletter and more!](https://lp.stratfor.com/stratfornewsletter) ![image of globe](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/globe_color.svg) ### Connected Content Regions & Countries [India](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region/south-asia/india) Topics [Environment, Science & Technology](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/environment-science-technology) [Military & Security](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic/military-security) ### Article Search * * * [![Stratfor Worldview](https://worldview.stratfor.com/images/wv/logo-rane-worldview-footer.png)](https://ranenetwork.com/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rane) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranenetwork) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheRANENetwork/) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ranenetwork) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/TheRANENetwork) ### Forecasts - [All Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts) - [Quarterly Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/quarterly) - [Annual Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/annual) - [Decade Forecasts](https://worldview.stratfor.com/forecasts/decade) ### ANALYSES - [Snapshots](https://worldview.stratfor.com/snapshot) - [Assessments](https://worldview.stratfor.com/assessments) ### SECTIONS - [Situation Reports](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-reports) ### Explore - [Topics](https://worldview.stratfor.com/topic) - [Regions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/region) ### Subscribe - [Individual](https://worldview.stratfor.com/subscribe) - [Teams & Enterprises](https://lp.stratfor.com/learn-more-about-worldview-for-teams-and-enterprises) ### Help & Support - [Contact Us](https://ranenetwork.com/contact) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.ranenetwork.com/privacy-policy) - [Terms of Use](https://www.ranenetwork.com/terms-of-use) - Copyright ©2024 RANE Network Inc. ![Stratfor | Your World.

On the list are the usual suspects, including al Qaeda and the Islamic State, however, Abi-Hanna warns that a greater threat to the West is the far-right ideological extremist. Violence by these types of groups and individuals, including anti-government extremists, pose a greater direct security risk to the West than any jihadist group.

(TheFinalMiracle via Shutterstock) India has been hit with an onslaught of destructive floods followed by severe droughts in recent years. Meanwhile, the country's increasing animosity with Pakistan risk complicating the Indus Water Treaty, which dictates the share of water each country receives from the Indus River basin. Suffice to say, water has become a hot geopolitical issue for the country of 1.3 billion people, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. In this podcast, Stratfor's South Asia Analyst, Faisel Pervaiz, speaks with contributor Ambika Vishwanath about India's escalating water crisis and the ways in which it will seep into each crevice of the country's domestic and foreign policy aims.

On Jan. 24, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was closely monitoring signs of increasing military cooperation between nearby Bangladesh and Pakistan following reports that the chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had visited Bangladesh, which the Bangladeshi government later denied. The announcement also follows reports by Indian media in late December that Pakistan would begin training Bangladesh's army in February 2025, which would mark the two countries' first military training agreement since the 1971 Liberation War that led to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. While Bangladesh dismissed these reports as well, the developments nonetheless reflect New Delhi's growing tensions with the new interim government in Dhaka, which has sought a more balanced approach to foreign policy...",

(3alexd/Getty Images) Parag Khanna contributed a column to this space earlier this month. His column was excerpted from his book, Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization, published April 19. Containing so much more than one piece could relay, the publication of Khanna's book excites me, and in this week's Global Affairs I'd like to share my enthusiasm and the reasons for it. Khanna's content is genuinely innovative. He connects old dots in new ways, quite literally. He asks us to remap the world in terms of its connections rather than its borders. Connective infrastructure trumps separatist nationalism. The economics of supply lines moves into the foreground as politics and ideology fade into the background. Channeling Khanna requires a form as innovative as his content. Because he is such a good writer -- a master of the ringing cadence -- I'll experiment in this column with a form that's different from the usual book...

(NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images) The Indian economy retains solid momentum and multiple advantages compared with many other lower-middle-income countries, which should enable India to emerge relatively unscathed from the impending global economic downturn and intensifying financial volatility. Following the COVID-induced recession in 2020, India's economy rebounded very strongly in 2021 and has maintained solid growth ever since. India has also overtaken China as the fastest-expanding economy among larger emerging economies. While inflation remains high in India due to global energy and food price shocks, it is not overwhelming.

(TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) U.S. attempts to build an anti-China coalition will compel Beijing to expand its cyber campaign, leading to more cyberattacks on regional governments and Western corporations, particularly in strategic tech sectors. Cyber industrial espionage and coercive cyberattacks will be essential in limiting the fallout from global tech restrictions against China and undermining U.S. alliance-building. China will flirt with information campaigns in its periphery, but may struggle to weaponize such campaigns with the same success as Russia due to its inexperience and limited cultural overlap with Western countries. ...

Across the West, including the United States and much of Europe, water systems tend to be more vulnerable than other types of critical infrastructure due in large part to the fact that they are more likely to be municipally owned or operated by smaller utility companies. As a result, these systems are more likely to rely on local taxes and water rates to make up their budgets, frequently leading to financial constraints. Therefore, many water systems operators struggle to adequately update security measures, such as by replacing aging equipment, implementing...",

(HIMANSHU SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) While India will keep negotiating a trade deal with Washington, it will remain protective of its agricultural sector and continue purchasing Russian oil, heightening the risk of prolonged exposure to high U.S. tariffs that will strain India's exports. On Aug. 27, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50%. These tariffs are linked to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, which the White House alleges are funding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. While other major importers of Russian oil, such as China and Turkey, were notably not targeted with U.S. tariffs, India's exports -- particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments, gems and jewelry -- are significantly affected.... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

    "snippet": "",
    "full_text": "With Washington launching its protectionist trade offensive, New Delhi faces a pivotal test in balancing national interests and global market access. **Impact of US tariffs**: The much-dreaded Liberation Day, Washington’s euphemism for a sweeping wave of tariffs, finally arrived on April 2. As anticipated, India found itself on the receiving end, with a 26% tariff slapped on its exports to the United States. The move has raised serious concerns about the future of trade ties between New Delhi and its largest export destination. In a dramatic shift from traditional diplomacy, President Donald Trump announced that the US would impose tariffs equal to half of what other countries charge on American goods. Since India levies a cumulative 52% tariff on US products, the new White House annexure listed a reciprocal 27% tariff on Indian goods. But this is only the beginning. According to a White House fact sheet, a 10% base tariff on all imports will take effect from April 5. From April 9, countries running the highest trade deficits with the US — including India — will face even steeper levies. A total of 185 countries are expected to be impacted. With these moves, the average US tariff rate has now surged to 29% — its highest level in over a century. **READ \\| [Ayushman Bharat: A grand promise undone by poor execution](https://www.policycircle.org/society/ayushman-bharat-scheme-pmjay/)** ### **Blow to India’s export ambitions** The fallout for India is likely to be significant. The US is one of the few major economies with which India enjoys a trade surplus — $46 billion as of 2024. However, these gains now stand threatened. India had already been in Washington’s crosshairs, featuring in Trump’s infamous Dirty 15 list — countries deemed the worst offenders in terms of trade practices. The sectors expected to be hit hardest include agriculture, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and precious stones. #### Trump effect: Additional US tariffs on India Compiled by Murali Kallummal, Professor, Centre for WTO Studies, IIFT According to a recent study by the Global Trade Research Initiative ( [GTRI](https://gtri.co.in/)), the most affected agricultural segments will be fish, meat, and processed seafood — which together accounted for $2.58 billion in exports to the US last year. Notably, America absorbs 40% of India’s total shrimp exports. Higher tariffs will erode competitiveness and shrink market share. India’s gains in electronics could also unravel. The Indian government had worked to position the country as a viable alternative to China under the China+1 strategy, especially in smartphone manufacturing. Finished smartphones currently attract a 16-20% import duty in India, while Indian exports to the US enjoy zero duty. But if US tariffs now apply to Indian phones, the fledgling sector may suffer a blow in its early growth phase, potentially reversing hard-won progress. One silver lining, however, is that India’s IT services — which form a large chunk of exports — are exempt from goods-specific tariffs, at least for now. ### **Navigating a rising trade storm** The pressing question for India’s policymakers is: how to counter mounting trade pressure from Washington without derailing its export-led growth strategy? A crucial step would be to fast-track the ongoing negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US. Talks have been in motion, and both sides have incentives to reach an accord quickly. A successful BTA could offer exemptions or relief from some of the punitive measures. India has already taken pre-emptive steps. In March, New Delhi signed the terms of reference for a BTA following a push from the Prime Minister’s Office. It also lowered duties on select American products — including high-end motorcycles, agricultural goods, and Bourbon whiskey — in its Union Budget, signalling a willingness to negotiate. Still, New Delhi must tread carefully. While India’s tariff levels may appear high, they reflect domestic development goals and the need to protect vulnerable industries. The US prioritises its commercial interests. India too must evaluate each demand against its own national priorities — development, industrialisation, and cultural values. A recent PwC report recommended that Indian businesses build long-term resilience strategies — including diversification of markets and value chain upgrades — to mitigate the impact of US protectionism. ### **Strategic realignments** Amid this backdrop, an intriguing diplomatic overture emerged. On April 2 — coinciding with the US tariff announcement — China and India marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a message to Indian President Droupadi Murmu, called for a “dragon-elephant tango” to strengthen cooperation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed the sentiment, noting that stronger India-China ties would support a stable, multipolar world. Observers see this as a subtle signal to Washington: major developing economies are willing to explore alternative alliances if pushed too hard. Xi emphasised the need for mutual modernisation between China and India as leading voices of the Global South — perhaps suggesting a pivot away from overreliance on Western markets. ### **The road ahead** The 26% reciprocal tariff may compel India to re-examine its own tariff structures, not just in response to the US, but to remain competitive in global markets. The coming weeks will be critical as New Delhi awaits a formal list of US demands and considers its options. India remains an essential market for US companies across sectors — from tech to pharmaceuticals — and this mutual interdependence offers room for compromise. India’s strategy should be to engage the US in negotiations rather than escalate into a full-blown trade war. As noted in a Bernstein report, India’s measured, diplomatic approach could help it navigate the turbulent waters of trade protectionism, preserving both economic stability and strategic autonomy.

(PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's 27% tariff on India would severely hurt certain Indian sectors reliant on the U.S. market, such as pharmaceuticals; however, other sectors, such as textiles, could benefit if India's main Asian competitors end up facing even higher U.S. tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping ''reciprocal'' tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners, including a 27% tariff on India. In justifying the move, the Trump administration cited India's unfair trade practices, pointing to longstanding barriers faced by U.S. exporters, as well as the South Asian country's $46 billion trade surplus with the United States. The announcement came despite India's recent efforts to address such grievances, which began in February after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Trump in Washington and agreed to initiate trade negotiations. Since then, India has pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. energy exports to $25 billion, up... ## Subscribe to view this article Subscribe Now [Subscribe](https://www.ranenetwork.com/worldview-subscribe) Already have an account?

India and Brazil faced the highest rate of 50%, driven by concerns over market access and trade misalignments, despite contrasting trade balances-the U.S. had a $7 billion surplus with Brazil and a $46 billion deficit with India. Meanwhile countries with larger deficits like Vietnam ($123B), Taiwan ($74B), Japan ($69B), and the EU ($236B)1, were subject to moderate tariffs between 15%-20%, due to their roles as strategic allies and supply chain alternatives. ## Weekly highlights India’s April–June 2025 GDP 7.8% as of September 3, 2025 MSCI India Q2 EPS Growth 5.0% as of September 3, 2025 FPI Outflows Post Tariff Hike $4.4 B as of September 3, 2025 ## US tariffs on Indian goods: Sectoral impact and market implications The 50% tariff on Indian goods came into effect on August 27, 2025, following an announcement by the United States earlier in the month. The move involved a 25% hike over an existing 25% rate, making it one of the steepest tariff measures globally. India exported goods worth $86.5 billion to the US in FY 2024–25, representing 19.8% of its total merchandise exports. Of this, the majority of exports will now face the 50% tariff, covering sectors such as textiles, gems & jewelry, dairy & agriculture, machinery & engineering goods, ceramics, and furniture. Gems & jewelry and textiles are particularly exposed, with the U.S. absorbing nearly 33% and 29% of India’s total exports in these categories-both of which are labor-intensive and employment-heavy. However, several strategic categories remain exempt, including pharmaceuticals (which represent 40% of India’s total pharma exports), active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), electronics, refined light oil, gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel. The announcement of new tariffs disrupted the Indian equity market’s recovery from a late-2024 sell-off, which had been driven by stretched valuations and slowing earnings growth. YTD, India has returned 6.42%2, underperforming major global indices and trailing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 18%3. Despite this, valuations remain elevated, with the MSCI India Index trading at a forward P/E of 22.28-nearly 9% above its 10-year average. The imposition of an additional 25% tariff triggered foreign portfolio outflows totaling $4.4 billion4, weakening the rupee and increasing currency volatility. While equity indices initially dipped, they rebounded on optimism surrounding potential diplomatic engagement, policy support, tax reforms, and resilient domestic inflows. However, with trade negotiations stalling, the MSCI India Index declined 1.2% ahead of the August 27 tariff rollout. Following this, Indian corporates saw sharp earnings downgrades across key sectors, reflecting weak quarterly performance, margin pressures, and sector-specific headwinds. Consumer Discretionary was impacted by muted demand and elevated valuations; Health Care by regulatory constraints and weak exports; Financials by slowing credit growth and rising funding costs; and Consumer Staples by margin compression and uneven rural trends. Notably, the MSCI India Index saw a forward EPS revision of -0.9% and NTM EPS growth of -0.6% as of end of August. While exports to the U.S. represent only about 2% of India’s GDP, and total exports account for 21%5 of GDP in FY2025, India’s economy remains fundamentally consumption-driven and less exposed to external trade shocks than many other emerging markets. As a result, the recent U.S. tariff announcement, though disruptive to sentiment, is less of a structural concern. What matters more to investors is the lack of a sustained recovery in corporate earnings, which continues to weigh on valuations. Encouragingly, domestic investor participation has remained strong, with SIP6 flows rebounding from April after a slow start to the year. This has helped cushion the impact of foreign portfolio outflows and supported market sentiment. Additional tailwinds include upside surprises in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters, reaching 7.8% in April–June 2025 and increased clarity on tax reform measures. However, going forward, a meaningful and sustained pickup in earnings will be the key driver of market performance. ## Go beyond the headlines... Skimmed the summary?

Equity securities may fluctuate in value and can decline significantly in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions. Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks, but contain interest rate risk (as interest rates raise, bond prices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer credit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk. These effects are usually pronounced for longer-term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Currency Risk is a form of risk that arises from the change in price of one currency against another. Whenever investors or companies have assets or business operations across national borders, they face currency risk if their positions are not hedged. Generally, among asset classes, stocks are more volatile than bonds or short-term instruments. Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns. U.S. Treasury Bills maintain a stable value if held to maturity, but returns are generally only slightly above the inflation rate. © 2025 State Street Corporation - All Rights Reserved.
